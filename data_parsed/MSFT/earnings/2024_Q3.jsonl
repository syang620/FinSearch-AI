{"doc_id": "MSFT_2024_Q3", "ticker": "MSFT", "year": 2024, "quarter": 3, "filing_date": "2024-09-01", "phase": "qa", "speaker_name": "Satya Nadella", "speaker_role": "CEO", "speaker_firm": null, "utterance_id": "u_0001", "utterance_type": "answer", "text": "Thank you, Brett. It was a record third quarter, powered by the continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $35 billion in revenue, up 23%. \nMicrosoft Copilot and Copilot stack, spanning everyday productivity, business process, and developer services, to models, data, and infrastructure, are \norchestrating a new era of AI transformation, driving better business outcomes across every role and industry. Now, I\u2019ll highlight examples, walking up the stack, \nstarting with AI infrastructure. Azure again took share, as customers use our platforms and tools to build their own AI solutions. We offer the most diverse \nselection of AI accelerators, including the latest from NVIDIA, AMD, as well as our own first-party silicon. Our AI innovation continues to build on our strategic \npartnership with OpenAI. More than 65% of the Fortune 500 now use Azure OpenAI Service. We also continue to innovate and partner broadly to bring customers \nthe best selection of frontier models and open source models, LLMs and SLMs. With Phi-3, which we announced earlier this week, we offer the most capable and \ncost-effective SLM available. It\u2019s already being trialed by companies like CallMiner, LTIMindtree, PwC, and TCS. Our Models as a Service offering makes it easy \nfor developers to use LLMs and SLMs without having to manage any underlying infrastructure. Hundreds of paid customers, from Accenture and EY, to Schneider \nElectric, are using it to take advantage of API access to third-party models, including as of this quarter the latest from Cohere, Meta, and Mistral. And, as part of a \npartnership announced last week, G42 will run its AI applications and services on our cloud. All-up, the number of Azure AI customers continues to grow and \naverage spend continues to increase. We also saw an acceleration of revenue from migrations to Azure. Azure Arc continues to help customers like DICK'S \nSporting Goods and World Bank streamline their cloud migrations. Arc now has 33,000 customers, up over 2X year-over-year. And, we are the hyperscale \nplatform of choice for SAP and Oracle workloads, with Conduent and Medline moving their on-premises Oracle estates to Azure, and Kyndryl and L'Oreal \nmigrating their SAP workloads to Azure. Overall, we are seeing an acceleration in the number of large Azure deals from leaders across industries, including billion \ndollar plus multi-year commitments announced this month from Cloud Software Group and The Coca-Cola Company. The number of $100 million plus Azure \ndeals increased over 80% year-over-year, while the number of $10 million plus deals more than doubled. Now, on to data and analytics. Our Microsoft Intelligent \nData Platform provides customers with the broadest capabilities spanning databases, analytics, business intelligence, governance, and AI. Over half of our Azure \nAI customers also use our data and analytics tools. Customers are building intelligent applications running on Azure, PostgreSQL and Cosmos DB with deep \nintegrations with Azure AI. TomTom is a great example. They\u2019ve used Cosmos DB along with Azure Open AI service to build their own immersive in-car \ninfotainment system. We are also encouraged by our momentum with our next-generation analytics platform, Microsoft Fabric. Fabric now has over 11,000 paid \ncustomers, including leaders in every industry from ABB, EDP, Energy Transfer to Equinor, Foot Locker, ITOCHU and Lumen, and we are seeing increased \nusage intensity. Fabric is seamlessly integrated with Azure AI Studio, meaning customers can run models against enterprise data that\u2019s consolidated in Fabric\u2019s \nmulti-cloud data lake, OneLake. And Power BI, which is also natively integrated with Fabric provides business users with AI-powered insights. We now have over \n350,000 paid customers. Now on to developers. GitHub Copilot is bending the productivity curve for developers. We now have 1.8 million paid subscribers with \ngrowth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter and continues to see increased adoption from businesses in every industry, including Itau, Lufthansa \nSystems, Nokia, Pinterest and Volvo cars. CoPilot is driving growth across the broader GitHub platform, too. AT&T, Citi Group and Honeywell all increased their \noverall GitHub usage after seeing productivity and code quality increases with CoPilot. All up more than 90% of the Fortune 100 are now GitHub customers and \nrevenue accelerated over 45% year-over-year. Anyone can be a developer with new AI-powered features across our low-code, no-code tools, which makes it \neasier to build an app, automate workflow or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations, across every industry have used Copilot Studio to \ncustomize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. Cineplex, for example, built a Copilot for customer service agents, reducing \nquery handling time from as much as 15 minutes to 30 seconds. All up over 330,000 organizations, including over half of Fortune 100 have used AI-powered \ncapabilities in Power Platform, and Power Apps now has over 25 million monthly active users, up over 40% year-over-year. Now on to future of work, we are \nseeing AI democratize expertise across the workforce. What inventory turns are to efficiency of supply chains, knowledge turns, the creation and diffusion and \nknowledge are to productivity of an organization. And Copilot for Microsoft 365 is helping increase knowledge turns, thus having a cascading effect changing \nwork, work artifacts and workflows and driving better decision-making, collaboration and efficiency. This quarter, we made Copilot available to organizations of all \ntypes and sizes from enterprises to small businesses, nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 now use Copilot and we have seen accelerated adoption across industries\n\nand geographies with companies like Amgen, BP, Cognizant, Koch Industries, Moody\u2019s, Novo Nordisk, NVIDIA, and Tech Mahindra purchasing over 10,000\nseats. We\u2019re also seeing increased usage intensity from early adopters, including a nearly 50% increase in the number of Copilot-assisted interactions per user in\nTeams, bridging group activity with business process workflows and enterprise knowledge. And we\u2019re not stopping there. We\u2019re accelerating our innovation,\nadding over 150 Copilot capabilities since the start of the year. With Copilot and Dynamics 365, we are helping businesses transform every role in business\nfunction as we take share with our AI-powered apps across all categories. This quarter, we made our Copilot for Service and Copilot for Sales broadly available,\nhelping customer service agents and sellers at companies like Land O\u2019Lakes, Northern Trust, Rockwell Automation and Toyota Group generate role-specific\ninsights and recommendations from across Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365, as well as third-party platforms like Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Zendesk. And with\nour Copilot for Finance, we are drawing context from dynamics, as well as ERP systems like SAP to reduce labor-intensive processes like collections and\ncontract and invoice capture for companies like Dentsu and IDC. ISVs are also building their own co-pilot integrations. For example, new integrations between\nAdobe Experience Cloud and Copilot will help marketeers access campaign insights in the flow of their work. When it comes to devices, Copilot in Windows is\nnow available on nearly 225 million Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs, up 2x quarter-over-quarter. With Copilot, we have an opportunity to create an entirely new\ncategory of devices, purpose-built for this new generation of AI. All of our largest OEM partners have announced AI PCs in recent months. And this quarter, we\nintroduced new surface devices, which includes integrated NPUs to power on-device AI experiences like auto framing and live captions. And there is much more\nto come in just a few weeks, we\u2019ll hold a special event to talk about our AI vision across Windows and devices. When it comes to Teams, we once again saw\nyear-over-year usage growth. We\u2019re rolling out a new version, which is up to two times faster while using 50% less memory to all customers. We surpassed 1\nmillion Teams Rooms for the first time as we continue to make hybrid meetings better with new AI-powered features like automatic camera switching and speaker\nrecognition. And Teams Phone continues to be the market leader in cloud calling now with over 20 million PSTN users, up nearly 30% year-over-year. All of this\ninnovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365 companies across the private and public sector, including Amadeus, BlackRock, Chevron, Ecolab,\nKimberly-Clark. All chose our premium E5 offerings this quarter for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics. Now on to industry and cross-industry\nclouds. We are also bringing AI-powered transformation to every industry. In health care, DAX Copilot is being used by more than 200 health care organizations,\nincluding Providence, Stanford Health Care and WellSpan Health. And in manufacturing, this week at Hannover Messe, customers like BMW, Siemens and Volvo\nPenta shared how they're using our cloud and AI solutions to transform factory operations. Now on to security. Security underpins every layer of the tech stack,\nand it's our number one priority. We launched our Secure Future Initiative last fall for this reason, bringing together every part of the company to advance\ncybersecurity protection, and we are doubling down on this very important work, putting security above all else, before all other features and investments. We are\nfocused on making continuous progress across the six pillars of this initiative as we protect tenants and isolate production systems, protect identities and secrets,\nprotect networks, protect engineering systems, monitor and detect threats, and accelerate responses and remediation. We remain committed to sharing our\nlearnings, tools and innovation with customers. A great example is Copilot for Security, which we made generally available earlier this month, bringing together\nLLMs with domain-specific skills informed by our threat intelligence and 78 trillion daily security signals to provide security teams with actionable insights. Now let\nme talk about our consumer businesses starting with LinkedIn. We continue to combine our unique data with this new generation of AI to transform the way\nmembers learn, sell and get hired. Features like LinkedIn AI-assisted messages are seeing a 40% higher acceptance rate and accepted over 10% faster by job\nseekers, saving hirers time and making it easier to connect them to candidates. Our AI-powered collaborative articles, which has reached over 12 million\ncontributions are helping increase engagement on the platform, which reached a new record this quarter. New AI features are also helping accelerate LinkedIn\nPremium growth with revenue up 29% year-over-year. And we are also seeing strength across our other businesses with hiring taking share for the seventh\nconsecutive quarter. Now on to search, advertising and news. We once again took share across Bing and Edge as we continue to apply this new generation of AI\nto transform how people search and browse. Bing reached over 140 million daily active users, and we are particularly encouraged by our momentum in mobile.\nOur free Copilot apps on iOS and Android saw a surge in downloads after our Super Bowl ad and are among the highest rated in this category. We also rolled out\nCopilot to our ad platform this quarter, helping marketeers use AI to generate recommendations for product images, headlines and descriptions. Now on to\ngaming. We are committed to meeting players where they are by bringing great games to more people on more devices. We set third quarter records for game\nstreaming hours, console usage and monthly active devices. And last month, we added our first Activision Blizzard title Diablo IV to our Game Pass service.\nSubscribers played over 10 million hours within the first 10 days, making it one of our biggest first-party Game Pass launches ever. We were also encouraged by\nongoing success of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, which is attracting new gamers and retaining franchise loyalists. Finally, we are expanding our games to new\nplatforms, bringing four of our fan favorite titles to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation for the first time. In fact, earlier this month, we had seven games among\nthe top 25 on the PlayStation store more than any other publisher. In closing, I'm energized about our opportunity ahead as we innovate to help people and\nbusinesses thrive in this new era. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.", "char_count": 12646, "word_count": 1965, "token_count": 2620, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}
{"doc_id": "MSFT_2024_Q3", "ticker": "MSFT", "year": 2024, "quarter": 3, "filing_date": "2024-09-01", "phase": "qa", "speaker_name": "Amy Hood", "speaker_role": "Unknown", "speaker_firm": null, "utterance_id": "u_0002", "utterance_type": "statement", "text": "Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter revenue was $61.9 billion, up 17%; and earnings per share was $2.94, up 20%. Results \nexceeded expectations, and we delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth with continued share gains across many of our businesses. \nIn our commercial business, bookings increased 29% and 31% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by Azure commitments with an \nincrease in average deal size and deal length as well as strong execution across our core annuity sales motions. In Microsoft 365, suite strength contributed to \nARPU expansion for our Office Commercial business, although new business growth continued to moderate for stand-alone products sold outside the Microsoft \n365 suite. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 20% and 21% in constant currency to $235 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue \nin the next 12 months, up 20% year-over-year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 21%. And this quarter, our annuity mix \nincreased to 97%. In our consumer business, PC market demand was slightly better than we expected, benefiting Windows OEM, while advertising spend landed \nrelatively in line with our expectations. In gaming, we also saw better-than-expected performance of Activision titles, benefiting Xbox content and services. At a \ncompany level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2-point drag on operating income growth and had a \nnegative $0.04 impact to earnings per share. A reminder, that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship \nas a third-party partner to first party and also includes $935 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs. FX did not \nhave a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS and operating \nexpense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $35.1 billion and grew 23%, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly \nyear-over-year to 72%, a bit better than expected. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased \nslightly, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Company \ngross margin dollars increased 18% and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting \nestimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point even with the impact from the purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related \ncosts from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by the improvement in Azure and Office 365 just mentioned as well as sales mix shift to higher-margin \nbusinesses. Operating expenses increased 10% with 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, head count at the end of March was 1% \nlower than a year ago. Operating income increased 23% and operating margins increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 45%, excluding the impact of the \nchange in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 3 points, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage\n\nthrough continued cost discipline. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $19.6 billion and grew 12% and 11% in \nconstant currency, in line with expectations. Office Commercial revenue grew 13% and 12% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 15%, \nin line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution, ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum and early Copilot for Microsoft 365 progress. Paid \nOffice 365 commercial seats grew 8% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small \nand medium business and frontline worker offerings, although growth continued to moderate in SMB. Office Commercial Licensing declined 20% and 18% in \nconstant currency, with continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office Consumer revenue increased 4%, slightly below expectations. Microsoft 365 \nsubscriptions grew 14% to $80.8 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly \nbetter-than-expected performance in our premium subscriptions and Talent Solutions businesses. However, in Talent Solutions, bookings growth continues to be \nimpacted by the weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Dynamics revenue grew 19% and 17% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Growth was \ndriven by Dynamics 365, which grew 23% and 22% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads and better-than-expected new business, \nalthough bookings growth remains moderated. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11%, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. \nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly driven by improvement in Office 365. Operating expenses \nincreased 1% and operating income increased 17% and 16% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $26.7 billion, increasing \n21%, ahead of expectations with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall, Server products and cloud services revenue grew 24%. Azure and \nother cloud services revenue grew 31% ahead of expectations, while our AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected. In the non-AI portion of our \nconsumption business, we saw greater-than-expected demand broadly across industries and customer segments as well as some benefit from a \ngreater-than-expected mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition. In our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 10% to \nover 274 million seats, with continued impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue \nincreased 6%, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected renewal strength, particularly for contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. \nEnterprise and partner services revenue decreased 9% on a strong prior year comparable for enterprise support services. Segment gross margin dollars \nincreased 20% and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate [indiscernible] \npercentage increased slightly, primarily driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by \nsales mix shift to Azure. Operating expenses increased 1% and operating income grew 32%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $15.6 billion, \nincreasing 17% with 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations, driven by better-than-expected performance in \ngaming and Windows OEM. Windows OEM revenue increased 11% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by the slightly better PC market noted \nearlier as well as mix shift to higher monetizing markets. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 13% and 12% in constant \ncurrency, below expectations with impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier as well as lower in-period revenue recognition from a \nmix of contracts. Devices revenue decreased 17% and 16% in constant currency as we remain focused on our higher-margin premium products. Overall, Surface \ndemand was slightly lower than expected. Search and News advertising revenue ex TAC increased 12% ahead of expectations with continued volume growth \nand increased engagement on Bing and Edge. And in gaming. Revenue increased 51% and 50% in constant currency with 55 points of net impact from the \nActivision acquisition. Results were ahead of expectations, primarily driven by Call of Duty. Xbox content and services revenue increased 62% and 61% in \nconstant currency with 61 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox hardware revenue decreased 31% and 30% in constant currency. Segment \ngross margin dollars increased 27% and 26% in constant currency, with 13 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage \nincreased roughly 4 points year-over-year, primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 41% with 43 points \nfrom the Activision acquisition. Operating income increased 16% and 15% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, \nincluding finance leases, were $14 billion to support our cloud demand, inclusive of the need to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash paid for PP&E was $11 billion. \nCash flow from operations was $31.9 billion, up 31%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $21 billion, up 18% year-over-year, \nreflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $854 million, lower than \nanticipated, driven by losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $8.4 \nbillion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar \nbasis. First, FX. Based on current rates, which reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue and segment level \nrevenue growth by less than 1 point. When compared to our January guide for Q4, FX, this is a decrease to total revenue of roughly $700 million. We expect FX \nto decrease COGS growth by approximately 1 point and operating expense growth by less than 1 point. In commercial bookings, we expect solid growth on a \nrelatively flat expiry base driven by continued strong commercial sales execution. As a reminder, larger, long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable \nin their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 2 points \nyear-over-year. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate, Q4 cloud gross margin percentage will be down slightly as improvement in Azure, \ninclusive of scaling our AI infrastructure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure. We expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis \ndriven by cloud and AI infrastructure investments. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-outs \nand the timing of finance leases. We continue to bring capacity online as we scale our AI investments with growing demand. Currently, near-term AI demand is a \nbit higher than our available capacity. Next, to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 11% in \nconstant currency or US$19.9 billion to US$20.2 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across \ncustomer segments and ARPU growth primarily through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency. We continue to \nprogress with adoption of CoPilot for Microsoft 365 and remain excited for the long-term growth opportunity. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to \ndecline in the mid to high teens. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For \nLinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue \ngrowth in the low to mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For both LinkedIn and Dynamics, the continued bookings growth moderation noted earlier is a headwind \nto Q4 revenue growth. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or US$28.4 billion to US$28.7 billion. \nRevenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue \nrecognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be 30% to 31% in constant currency or similar to our \nstronger-than-expected Q3 results. Growth will be driven by our Azure Consumption business and continued contribution from AI with some impact from the AI \ncapacity availability noted earlier. Our per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum. Though we expect continued moderation in seat \ngrowth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits with continued \nhybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in Enterprise and Partner Services revenue should decline in the mid- to high single \ndigits on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 13% in \nconstant currency or US$15.2 billion to US$15.6 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits as PC market unit volumes \ncontinue at pre-pandemic levels. In Windows Commercial Products and Cloud Services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions \nshould drive revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition \ndepending on the mix of contracts. In Devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search \nand news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued volume strength. This will be higher than overall search and\n\nnews advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be relatively flat. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including approximately\n50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s driven by approximately 60 points of\nnet impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline again year-over-year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between\nUS$19.6 billion to US$19.8 billion, including approximately $700 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision\nacquisition. We expect operating expense of US$17.15 billion to US$17.25 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration and\ntransaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Therefore, we now expect full year FY2024 operating margins to be up over 2 points year-over-year,\neven with our cloud and AI investments, the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year. This operating\nmargin expansion reflects the hard work across every team to drive efficiencies and maintain disciplined cost management, knowing we will continue to grow our\ncloud and AI investments next year. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $850 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest\nexpense and losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity\ninvestments which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Now I\u2019d like to share some closing thoughts as\nwe look to the next fiscal year. We continue to focus on building businesses that create meaningful value for our customers and therefore, significant growth\nopportunities for years to come. In FY2025, that focus on execution should again lead to double-digit revenue and operating income growth to scale to meet the\ngrowing demand signal for our cloud and AI products, we expect FY2025 capital expenditures to be higher than FY2024. These expenditures over the course of\nthe next year are dependent on demand signals and adoption of our services. So we will manage that signal through the year. We will also continue to prioritize\noperating leverage. And therefore, we expect FY2025 operating margins to be down only about 1 point year-over-year, even with our significant cloud and AI\ninvestments, as well as a full year of impact from the Activision acquisition. We are leading the AI platform wave and are committed to bringing that value to our\nglobal customers as we enter the final quarter of our fiscal year.

At a high level, the way we, as a management team, talk about it is there are two sides\nto this, right? There is training and their inference. Given that we want to be a leader in this big generational shift and paradigm shift in technology, that's on the\ntraining side. We want to be able to allocate the capital required to essentially be training these large foundation models and stay on the leadership position there.\nAnd we've done that successfully all the way today, and you've seen it flow through our P&L, and you can continue to see that going forward. Then Amy\nreferenced what we also do on the inference side, which is, one, we first innovate and build products. And of course, we have an infrastructure business that's\nalso dependent on a lot of ISVs building products that run on our infrastructure. And it's all going to be demand driven. In other words, we track \u2013 we're closely\nwhat's happening with inference demand, and that's something that we will manage, as Amy said in her remarks very, very closely.

There are a couple of things I\u2019d say. On the Azure side, which I think is what you specifically asked, we feel very good about the \u2013 we are\nfundamentally a share taker there because if you look at it from our perspective at this point, Azure has become a protocol for pretty much anybody who is doing\nan AI project. And so that's sort of been a significant help for us in terms of acquiring even new customers. Some of the logos I even referenced in my remarks,\nour new Azure customers. So, that's one. The second thing that we're also seeing is AI just doesn't sit on its own. So, AI projects obviously start with calls to AI\nmodels, but they also use a vector database. In fact, Azure Search, which is really used by even ChatGPT is one of the fastest-growing services for us. We have\nFabric integration to Azure AI. And so, Cosmos DB integration. So, the data tier, the dev tools is another place where we are seeing great traction. So, we are\nseeing adjacent services in Azure that get attached to AI. And lastly, I would say, migrations to Azure as well. So, this is not just all an AI story. We are also\nlooking at customers, I mean, this is something that we have talked about in the past, which is there's always an optimization cycle, but there's also \u2013 as people\noptimize, they spend money on new project starts, which will grow and then they'll optimize. So, it's a continuous side of it. So, these are the three trends that are\nplaying out on Azure in terms of what at least we see on demand side.", "char_count": 1532, "word_count": 287, "token_count": 354, "exchange_id": "ex_003", "exchange_role": "answer"}

Satya, when do you believe AI will hit the maturity level, will be net increase to IT or outside of IT spending? And\nwhat would be the leading indicators of that maturation?

Great set of questions, Mark. Let me just start by saying, a good place to start is to watch what\u2019s happening in terms of standard issues for software teams,\nright? I mean if you think about it, they bought tools in the past. Now, you basically buy tools plus Copilot, right? So, you could even say that this is characterized\nas perhaps shift of what is OpEx dollars into effectively tool spend because it gives operating leverage to all of the OpEx dollars you\u2019re spending today, right?\nThat\u2019s really a good example of, I think, what\u2019s going to happen across the board. We see that in customer service. We see that in sales. We see that in\nmarketing. Anywhere, there\u2019s operations. That\u2019s why I described it as knowledge turns. You can even think of it as lean for knowledge work, right, because it just\nreduces waste, increases speed, and customer value. And so, one of the interesting rate limiters here is culture change inside of organizations. When I say\nculture change that means process change. And Amy referenced this even in her answer to the first question because at the end of the day companies will have\nto take a process, simplify the process, automate the process, and apply these solutions. And so that requires not just technology, but in fact, companies to go do\nthe hard work of culturally changing how they adopt technology to drive that operating leverage. And this is where we are going to see firm-level performance\ndifferences. So, one of the things we see is any customer who is working closely with us deploying it internally at Microsoft we see it, right. We\u2019re also taking our\nown medicine to apply this across every process. And we know that this is not just about technology, it\u2019s about being able to have the methodology that goes with\nit. And so, we see it in software development. We see it in customer service. We\u2019re seeing it even in the horizontal use of Copilot today where every day people\nare discovering new workflows that they can optimize. And so, that\u2019s like the PC when it became standard issue in early 1990s. That\u2019s the closest analogy I can\ncome up with. And so, yes, it will take time for it to percolate through the economy, but this is faster diffusion, faster rate of adoption than anything we have seen\nin the past, as evidenced even by Copilot, right. It\u2019s faster than any suite we have sold in the past, but it is going to require workflow and process change.", "char_count": 2418, "word_count": 430, "token_count": 531, "exchange_id": "ex_005", "exchange_role": "answer"}

So the way we see it play out is, if you think about it, the way Office was used broadly for knowledge work was in the context of\nbusiness processes, right? So it's not like \u2013 when people do knowledge work, they're not doing knowledge work, they're doing knowledge work and support of\nmaking progress in the context of sales enablement, customer service, revenue ops, supply chain or what have you, right? So that's the first thing to note. And\nthey do it inside of e-mail. They do it inside of Teams. They do it inside of Excel, PowerPoint, Word and what have you. Now we have the ability to essentially\nbridge the work and the work artifacts inside of these knowledge worker tools with the workflow and the business process and the business process data. So\nwhen we think about our Copilot, our Copilot has that ability to integrate, whether it's with ServiceNow, it has the ability to integrate with SAP with Salesforce, with\nobviously Dynamics. That's what we are seeing. In fact, you'll hear us talk a lot about it at our developer conference, which is the extensibility and Copilot Studio\nis really off to the races in terms of the product that most people are excited because one of the things in the enterprise if you want to ground your Copilot with\nenterprise data, which is in all of these SaaS applications and Copilot Studio is the tool to use it, to make that happen. And so that's what we are seeing, which is\nwe are building a Copilot, which also happens to be an orchestrator of all in other Copilots, which to us appear as extensions. And net-net, what happens is some\nof these knowledge worker tools that people have used all the time, right? Because when you think about Teams, when you're having a meeting, you're not doing\na random meeting, the meeting is in the context of some business process. It could be a supply chain meeting where you're trying to understand which suppliers\nto bet on or what terms to do. And so now you can access all that data right in the Team's context. So that's I think what's exciting for us, having built all these\nhorizontal tools, which I would say we're under underappreciated for the amount of work.

I may take those a bit in reverse. It's a little easier to address them. When you think about \u2013 we've been talking about sort of stabilization and\nwhat you saw this quarter, if you break down the Azure number as you saw, which I think I talked a little bit about with Karl was 7 points of contribution from AI,\nand you could call them the difference '24 from our core really Azure business. And within that, the activity we saw and the consumption side was really this\nbalance that we were quite used to and have seen throughout the cloud transition. We saw new workload starts and we saw optimizations. And then those\noptimizations create new budget, and you apply it. And that cycle which is actually quite normal. We saw it again this quarter in a balanced way. And I think when\nwe talk about stabilization or even what we saw between Q2 and Q3, which is a bit of acceleration in that core, was a lot of the newer project starts relating back\nto not just AI starts, but lots of other workflows. The companies are still going from on-prem to cloud, Satya mentioned migrations. And some of that, which I know\nisn't as exciting as talking about all the AI projects. This is still really foundational work to allow companies to take advantage of the cost savings and the total\nTCO is still really good. And so I think that balance is really what you saw this quarter, and I do feel like there wasn't really a big difference, Michael, across\nindustries or across geos. So I would say it was actually pretty consistent is the other maybe texture that I could give you to that question. And so then when\nyou're saying do we keep sort of pointing to stabilization, I really do look sort of workload to workload. What are we seeing? Where it starts? And this one actually\nfelt quite balanced and optimization looks like they normally would, which by the way, is super important. It's something we encourage customers to do. You want\nto run your workloads as efficiently as you possibly can. It's critical to customers being able to grow and get value out of that. So I sometimes think we \u2013 you all\nmay ask the question more as a negative. And for us, it's just about a healthy cycle at the customer account level.", "char_count": 2224, "word_count": 408, "token_count": 484, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

I mean if you sort of\nsay this, what is this AI, it does two things, right? There's a new user experience, there is a natural language interface and second thing is it's the reasoning\nengine. And the reasoning engine requires good data, and it's good requires, good data for grounding, right? So people talk about something called retrieval\naugmented generation. And in that context, having good grounding data that then help with the reasoning, I think, is helpful. And then, of course, people are also\nlooking to sort of fine-tune or RLHF or essentially take the large model and ground it further. So all of these tools are now available, the sophistication of how to\npeople can deploy these models across various business processes where there is data and where there is tuning of these models is also getting more\nwidespread, even at system integrators and other developers are there to help enterprises. So all that's maturing. So we feel good. And this is what I think on the\ncommercial side, these are some of the harder problems to solve broad consumer, right? I mean I think this is a couple of orders of magnitude of improvements\nin, I'll call it, our models before we can sort of have more sophisticated open-ended consumer scenarios. Whereas in the enterprise, these are all things we can\ngo tackle. Again, I point to get up, if you think about how it's got an entire system, right? It's just not an AI model. It's the, AI \u2013 the user experience, scaffolding, the\neditor, the chat, then interpreter and the debugger work along with the continuations of the model to help essentially create these reasoning traces, which help the\nentire thing work. And effectively, what we are doing with Copilot, Copilot Studio and connectors to all these business systems, think of it as we are creating\nGitHub Copilot like scenarios for every business system. That's what I think is going to have both what Amy referenced is business value and better grounding.\nBut you're absolutely right in saying a lot of work we're doing with Fabric or Cosmos or PostgreSQL is about preparing that data so that it can be integrated with\nthese AI projects.", "char_count": 2283, "word_count": 396, "token_count": 487, "exchange_id": "ex_013", "exchange_role": "answer"}
