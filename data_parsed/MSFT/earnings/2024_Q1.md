## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Keith Weiss (Morgan Stanley)**: Excellent. Thank you for taking the question and very nice quarter. The pace of innovation you guys have been putting out has been pretty amazing. And the new
products garnering traction probably faster than we've expected on our side of the equation. But we're also working in an overall spending environment, that
remains volatile, and I think investors are getting more concerned on it. So two questions on this, one, based on sort of the new products and the innovation, do
you think you guys can sustain the type of commercial growth that we saw in Q1 as we go through the year or is the environment too tricky for that? And then
when it relates to investment, Amy, you've been able to keep overall OpEx growth very low, and it was very low this quarter. At some point, should we be thinking
about a return to a more aggressive investment behind all this product innovation?

**Satya Nadella (CEO)**: Maybe I can start, Keith, and Amy you can add to it. Overall there are multiple things, Keith, they're all happening obviously simultaneously. If you just take Azure
and try to characterize, where's the growth for Azure coming from or what sort of drivers for Azure numbers, there are three things all happening in parallel. Like,
for example, take cloud migrations. A good reminder of where we are and even the core cloud migration story is the new Oracle announcement. Once we
announced that the Oracle databases are going to be available on Azure, we saw a bunch of unlock from new customers who have significant Oracle estates that
have not yet moved to the cloud because they needed to rendezvous with the rest of the app estate in one single cloud. And so we're excited about that. So in
some sense, even the financial services sector, for example, is a good place where there's a lot of Oracle that still needs to move to the cloud. The second thing,
of course, is the workloads start, then workloads get optimized, and then new workloads start, and that cycle continues. We'll lap some of those optimization
cycles that were fairly extreme perhaps in the second half of our fiscal. And the third thing is, for us, that's unique and different is new workload starts around AI.
Given our leadership position, we are seeing complete new projects start, which are AI projects. And as you know, AI projects are not just about AI meters, they
have lots of other cloud meters as well. So that sort of gives you one side of what's happening in terms of enterprise. The other piece is on the SaaS side,
obviously, again, this is a new product that's going to go through the enterprise adoption cycle. The results around productivity, which we demonstrated with
GitHub Copilot, is what's giving us good confidence and our customers, more importantly, good confidence around what these products represent in terms of
value. And so we are in the very early innings there, and so we look forward to seeing the traction for these products going forward.

### Exchange 002

**Keith Weiss (Morgan Stanley)**: Excellent. Thank you, guys.

**Brett Iversen (President)**: Thanks, Keith. Joe, next question, please.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.

### Exchange 003

**Mark Moerdler (Bernstein)**: Thank you very much and congratulations on a really strong quarter. AI has been far stronger than expected, beat your guidance for Azure this quarter. And while
you discussed higher utilization and more GPUs have helped, has the fact that Microsoft has a full AI devstack Copilot reference architecture and plugin
architecture bidding a meaningful factor, not just from a revenue perspective, but also even potentially from a margin perspective? In addition, can you give us
any color on whether Azure GPU is predominantly model training or are we seeing a lot of inferencing yet from clients? Thanks.

**Satya Nadella (CEO)**: No. Thank you for the question, Mark. Yeah, it is true that we have -- the approach we have taken is a full stack approach all the way from whether it's ChatGPT
or Bing Chat or all our Copilots, all share the same model. So in some sense, one of the things that we do have is very, very high leverage of the one model that
we used -- which we trained, and then the one model that we are doing inferencing at scale. And that advantage sort of trickles down all the way to both utilization
internally, utilization of third parties, and also over time, you can see the sort of stack optimization all the way to the silicon because the abstraction layer to which
the developers are riding is much higher up than low-level kernels if you will. So, therefore, I think there is a fundamental approach we took, which was a technical
approach of saying we'll have Copilots and Copilot stack all available. That doesn't mean we don't have people doing training for open source models or
proprietary models. We also have a bunch of open source models. We have a bunch of fine-tuning happening, a bunch of RLHF happening. So there's all kinds
of ways people use it. But the thing is, we have scale leverage of one large model that was trained and one large model that's being used for inference across all
our first-party SaaS apps, as well as our API in our Azure AI service…

### Exchange 004

**Mark Moerdler (Bernstein)**: Extremely helpful. Thank you so much.

**Brett Iversen (President)**: Thanks, Mark. Joe, next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.

### Exchange 005

**Brent Thill (Jefferies)**: Thanks, Amy. Good to see the 12% growth. Many investors are asking, can you sustain double-digit growth, especially with a stronger AI boost coming in the
next several quarters?

**Brett Iversen (President)**: Thanks, Brent. Joe, next question, please.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.

### Exchange 006

**Raimo Lenschow (Barclays)**: Hey. Thank you. You sound very optimistic about the opportunity in the office space with Copilot coming out now very soon. Can you speak a little bit about --
what you're seeing in the customer base that tested this already in terms of how excited they were -- the special features there, and what does it mean in terms of
adoption curve for that going forward once you go GA on 1st of November? Thank you.

**Satya Nadella (CEO)**: No. Thanks. The question, Ramo, the good news is two-fold, one is the fact that, what is 40% of the Fortune 100 are already in the preview and are using the
product and I think you all have also done lots of checks and the feedback is very, very positive. And, in fact, the interesting thing is, it's not any one tool, right?
Which is the feedback even sort of is very clear that it's the all up. You just keep hitting the Copilot button across every surface, right, whether it's in Word to
create documents, in Excel to, do analysis, or PowerPoint or Outlook or Teams just like that. Clearly, the Teams meeting, which is an intelligent recap, it's not just
a dumb transcript. It's like having a knowledge base of all your meetings that you can query and add to essentially the knowledge terms of your enterprise. And so
we are seeing broad usage across and the interesting thing is, by different functions, whether it's in finance or in sales by roles, we are seeing productivity gains
like we saw with developers and GitHub Copilot. So that's the data. We are very excited about our Ignite conference, where we will talk a lot more about all of the
use cases and what's -- where's the value and give more prescriptive guidance on how people can deploy. But so far so good, as far as the data is and the
feedback is. And of course, this is an enterprise product, I mean, at the end of the day, we are grounded on enterprise cycle times in terms of adoption and ramp,
and it's incrementally priced, so, therefore that all will apply still. But at least for something completely new to have this level of usage already and this level of
excitement is something we're very, very pleased with.

### Exchange 007

**Raimo Lenschow (Barclays)**: Thank you.

**Brett Iversen (President)**: Thanks, Raimo. Joe, next question, please.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.

### Exchange 008

**Karl Keirstead (UBS)**: Okay. Great. Thanks, Amy. Congrats on the 28% constant currency Azure growth, that's terrific. I wanted to press you a little bit on the outlook for Azure. You're
obviously guiding to a 1 to 2 point decel in December and then stable thereafter. But why would it be stable? Why wouldn't it accelerate in the -- in the second half
of your fiscal year, if the AI contribution is increasing as you bring on more GPU capacity? Is this a function of perhaps continued Core ex-AI Azure spend
optimization, continuing or maybe even getting slightly worse? Why couldn't we see some upside in that Azure number? I know you're trying to be conservative,
but I'd just love to understand it? Thanks so much.

### Exchange 009

**Karl Keirstead (UBS)**: Okay. Terrific. Thanks.

**Brett Iversen (President)**: Thanks, Karl. Joe, next question, please.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed.

### Exchange 010

**Brent Bracelin (Piper Sandler)**: Thank you. Good afternoon. One thing that really stood out to me was the intelligent cloud segment operating margins. These came in, I think, at the highest level
in six years, despite elevated AI investments. Was there a one-time tailwind here that helped? Or are you at the point where Azure has got economies of scale,
where Microsoft could sustain high margins even with an ambitious AI investment cycle?

### Exchange 011

**Brent Bracelin (Piper Sandler)**: Makes sense. Thank you.

**Brett Iversen (President)**: Thanks, Brent. Joe, we have time for one last question.
Operator
Our last question will come from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please proceed.

### Exchange 012

**Gregg Moskowitz (Mizuho)**: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question. And maybe just a follow-up to what Brent was just asking about, but on the gross margin line. Amy, the
Microsoft cloud gross margin is up 2 points year-over-year, excluding the useful life change, a little more improvement than we've seen in some time and some
investors were worried that it might go in the other direction, given increased AI investments. And so, as you look forward, do you think that you could drive some
continued gross margin improvement over the medium term and even as higher CapEx will filter into the model? Thanks.

**Satya Nadella (CEO)**: And I'll just add that it'll be very well paired at the company level. I realize all of you care a lot about each one of our segments and each one of our KPIs, and I do
too, but at the end of the day, our stack and the way it works, the way we do our capital allocation, the way we think about even the optimization of the demand to
utilization is across the entirety of all of our segments and all of our products.

### Exchange 013

**Gregg Moskowitz (Mizuho)**: Very helpful. Thanks.

**Brett Iversen (President)**: Thanks, Gregg. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for join us today and we look-forward to speaking with all of you soon.
