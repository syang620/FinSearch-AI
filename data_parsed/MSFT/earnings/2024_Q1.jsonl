We are off to a strong start to the fiscal year, driven by the continued strength in Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $31.8 billion in quarterly \nrevenue, up 24%. With Copilots, we are making the age of AI real for people and businesses everywhere. We are rapidly infusing AI across every layer of the \ntech stack, and for every role and business process to drive productivity gains for our customers. Now I'll highlight examples of our progress starting with \ninfrastructure. Azure again took share as organizations bring their workloads to our cloud. We have the most comprehensive cloud footprint with more than 60 \ndata center regions worldwide, as well as, the best AI infrastructure for both training and inference. And we also have our AI services deployed in more regions, \nthan any other cloud provider. This quarter, we announced the general availability of our next-generation H100 Virtual Machines. Azure AI provides access to \nbest-in-class frontier models from OpenAI and open-source models, including our own, as well as from Meta and Hugging Face, which customers can use to build \ntheir own AI apps while meeting specific cost latency, and performance needs. Because of our overall differentiation more than 18,000 organizations now use \nAzure OpenAI services, including new to Azure customers. And we are expanding our reach with digital-first companies with OpenAI APIs as leading AI start-ups \nuse OpenAI to power their AI solutions, therefore, making them Azure customers as well. We continue to see more cloud migrations with Azure Arc. We're \nmeeting customers where they are, helping them run apps across on-prem edge and multi-cloud environments. We now have 21,000 Arc customers up 140% \nyear-over-year. We are the only other cloud provider to run Oracle's database services, making it simpler for customers to migrate their on-prem Oracle \ndatabases to our cloud. Customers like PepsiCo and Vodafone will have access to a seamless fully integrated experience for deploying, managing, and using \nOracle database instances on Azure. And we are the cloud of choice for customers' SAP workloads too. Companies like Brother Industries, Hanes, ZEISS, and \nZF Group all run SAP on Azure. Now on to data, in the age of Copilots, organizations are looking to consolidate their data estate, that's why with our Microsoft", "char_count": 2355, "word_count": 374, "token_count": 486, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

And with Microsoft Fabric, we are unifying compute, storage, and governance into one end-to-end analytical solution with an all-inclusive \nbusiness model. More than 16,000 customers are actively using Fabric, including over 50% of the Fortune 500. Now on to developers. With GitHub Copilot, we \nare increasing developer productivity by up to 55%, while helping them stay in the flow and bringing the joy back to coding. We have over 1 million paid Copilot \nusers and more than 37,000 organizations have subscribed to Copilot for business, up 40% quarter-over-quarter with significant traction outside the United \nStates. This quarter we added new capabilities with GitHub Copilot Chat, which are already being used by both digital natives like Shopify, as well as, leading \nenterprises like Maersk and PwC to supercharge the productivity of their software developers. All up, the number of developers using GitHub has increased 4x \nsince our acquisition five years ago. We've also brought Copilot to Power Platform, enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, build virtual agents \nand analyze data. More than 126,000 organizations, including 3M, Equinor, Lumen Technologies, Nationwide, PG&E, and Toyota have all used Copilot in Power \nPlatform to date. EY for example has enabled Copilot for all 170,000 plus Power Platform users at the company. And this quarter we added new Copilot \ncapabilities to Power Pages making it possible to build a data-driven website using just a few sentences or clicks. Finally, Power Apps remains the market leader \nand low-code no-code development, now with 20 million monthly active users, up 40% year-over-year. Now on to business applications, all-up Dynamics 365 took \nshare for the 10th consecutive quarter. We're using this AI inflection point to redefine our role in business applications. We are becoming the Copilot-led business \nprocess transformation layer on top of existing CRM systems like Salesforce. For example, our Sales Copilot help sellers that more than 15,000 organizations \nincluding Rockwell Automation, Sandvik Coromant, Securitas, and Teleperformance, personalize customer interactions based on data from third-party CRMs. \nWe're also bringing Copilot to Dynamics 365 to help with everything from suggested actions and content ideas, to faster access to valuable business data. And \nthis quarter, we introduced Copilot in Dynamics 365 Field Service, to help streamline frontline tasks. Now on to industry and cross-industry clouds. In healthcare, \nour Dragon Ambient eXperience solution helps clinicians automatically document patient interactions at the point of care. It's been used across more than 10 \nmillion interactions to date. And with DAX Copilot, we are applying generative AI models to draft high-quality clinical notes in seconds, increasing physician \nproductivity and reducing burnout. For example, Atrium Health, a leading provider in Southeast United States credits DAX Copilot with helping its physicians each \nsave up to 40 minutes per day in documentation time. We are also introducing healthcare data solutions in Microsoft Fabric, enabling providers like Northwestern\n\nMedicine and SingHealth to unify health data in a secure, compliant way. And with our Microsoft Cloud for sovereignty, which will become generally available by\nthe end of the calendar year, we offer industry-leading data sovereignty and encryption controls, meeting the specific needs of public sector customers around the\nworld. Now on to the future of work. Copilot is your everyday AI assistant, helping you be more creative in Word, more analytical in Excel, more expressive in\nPowerPoint, more productive in Outlook, and more collaborative in Teams. Tens of thousands of employees at customers like Bayer, KPMG, Mayo Clinic,\nSuncorp, and Visa, including 40% of the Fortune 100, are using Copilot as part of our early access program. Customers tell us that once they use Copilot, they\ncan't imagine work without it and we are excited to make it generally available for enterprise customers next week. This quarter, we also introduced a new hero\nexperience in Copilot, helping employees tap into their entire universe of work, data, and knowledge using chat (ph). And the new Copilot Lab helps employees\nbuild new work habits for this era of AI, by helping them turn good prompts into great ones. When it comes to Teams, usage continues to grow with more than\n320 million monthly active users, making Teams the place to work across chat, collaboration, meetings, and calling. This quarter, we introduced a new version of\nTeams that is up to 2 times faster, while using 50% less memory and includes seamless cross-tenant communications and collaboration. We've seen nine\nconsecutive quarters of triple-digit revenue growth for Teams Rooms, and more than 10,000 paid customers now use Teams Premium. Teams has also become\na multiplayer canvas for business process. There are more than 2,000 apps in Teams Store, and collaborative apps from Adobe, Atlassian and Workday, each\nexceeded 1 million monthly active users on Teams.

All up, we continue to see more\norganizations choose Microsoft 365, and companies across the private and public sectors including Cerberus, Chanel, and DXC Technology, all rely on our\nPremium E5 offerings for advanced security compliance, voice, and analytics. Now on to Windows, the PC market unit volumes were at roughly pre-pandemic\nlevels and we continue to innovate across Windows, adding differentiated AI-powered experiences to the operating system. We rolled out the biggest update to\nWindows 11 ever adding 150 new features including new AI-powered experiences in apps, like, Clipchamp, Paint, and Photos, and we introduced Copilot in\nWindows, the Everyday AI companion, which incorporates the context to the web, your work data and what you are doing on the PC to provide better assistance.\nWe are seeing accelerated Windows 11 deployments worldwide from companies like BP, Eurowings, Kantar, and RBC. Finally, with Windows 365 Boot and\nSwitch, we're making it easier than ever for employees at companies like Crocs, Hamburg Commercial Bank, the ING Bank to get a personalized Windows 365\nCloud PC with Copilot on any device.

We see high-demand for Security Copilot, the industry's first and most advanced generative AI product, which is now seamlessly\nintegrated with Microsoft 365 Defender. Dozens of organizations including Bridgewater, Fidelity National Financial, and Government of Alberta have been using\nCopilot in Preview, and early feedback has been positive. And we look forward to bringing Copilot to hundreds of organizations in the coming months as part of\nthe new early access program, so they can improve the productivity of their own, security operation centers and stop threats at machine speeds. More broadly,\nwe continue to take share across all major categories we serve, and our SIEM, Microsoft Sentinel now has more than 25,000 customers in revenue, surpassed $1\nbillion annual run-rate, and customers in every industry like Booz Allen Hamilton, Grant Thornton and MetLife use our end-to-end solutions to protect their\nenvironments. Now on to LinkedIn. We are now applying this new generation of AI to transform how the 985 million members learn, sell and get hired.\nMembership growth has now accelerated each quarter for over two years in a row. This quarter, we introduced new AI-driven features across all of our\nbusinesses, including our learning coach that gives members personalized content guidelines, and tools to help employers find qualified candidates and sellers\nand marketers attract buyers in a single step. Since introducing AI-assisted messages for recruiters five months ago, three-fourths of them say, it saved them\ntime. And we have seen a nearly 80% increase in members watching AI-related learning courses this quarter. More broadly, we continue to see record\nengagement and knowledge sharing on the platform. We now have more than 450 million newsletter subscriptions globally, up 3x year-over-year. Premium\nsubscription sign-ups were up 55% year-over-year and our hiring business took share for the fifth consecutive quarter. Now on to search, advertising, and news.\nWith our Copilot for the Web, we are redefining how people use the Internet to search and create. Bing users have engaged in more than 1.9 billion chats, and\nMicrosoft Edge has now gained share for 10 consecutive quarters. This quarter, we introduced new personalized answers, as well as, support for DALL-E 3,\nhelping people get more relevant answers and to create incredibly realistic images with more than 1.8 billion images have been created to-date. And with our\nCopilot and Shopping, people can find more tailored recommendations and better deals. We're also expanding to new endpoints, bringing Bing to Meta's AI chat\nexperience in order to provide more up-to-date answers, as well as access to real-time search information. Finally, we are integrating this new generation of AI\ndirectly into our ad platforms to more effectively connect marketeers to customer intent in chat experiences, both from us as well as customers like Axel Springer\nand Snap. Now on to gaming. We were delighted to close our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King earlier this month. Together, we will advance our goal of\nbringing great games to players everywhere on any endpoint. Already with Game Pass, we're redefining how games are distributed, played, and discovered. We\nset a record for hours played per subscriber this quarter. We released Starfield this quarter to broader acclaim, more than 11 million people have played the game\nto date. Nearly half of the hours played have been on PC and on launch day, we set a record for the most Game Pass subscriptions added on a single day ever.\nMinecraft has now surpassed 300 million copies sold, and with Activision Blizzard King, we now adds significant depth to our content portfolio. We will have $13\nbillion-plus franchises from Candy Crush, Diablo, and Halo to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls and Gears of War. And we're looking forward to one of our strongest\nfirst-party holiday lineups ever, including new titles like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Forza Motorsport. In closing, we are rapidly innovating to expand our\nopportunity across our consumer and commercial businesses, as we help our customers thrive in this new era.

This quarter's revenue was $56.5 billion, up 13% and 12% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.99 \nand increased 27% and 26% in constant currency. Consistent execution by our sales teams and partners drove a strong start to the fiscal year. Results exceeded \nexpectations and we saw share gains again this quarter across many businesses, as customers adopt our innovative solutions to transform their businesses. In \nour commercial business, the trends from the prior quarter continued. We saw healthy renewals, particularly in Microsoft 365 E5 and growth of new business \ncontinued to be moderated for standalone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. In Azure, as expected the optimization trends were similar to Q4. \nHigher-than-expected AI consumption contributed to revenue growth in Azure. And our consumer business, PC market unit volumes are returning to \npre-pandemic levels. Advertising spend, landed roughly in line with our expectations and in gaming strong engagement helped by the Starfield launch benefited \nXbox content and services. Commercial bookings increased 14% and 17% in constant currency, in line with expectations, primarily driven by strong execution \nacross our core annuity sales motions, with continued growth in the number of $10 million plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Commercial remaining \nperformance obligation, increased 18% to $212 billion, and roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 15% year-over-year. The \nremaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 20% and this quarter, our annuity mix was 96%. FX did not have a significant \nimpact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. \nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was $31.8 billion and grew 24% and 23% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud's gross margin percentage \nincreased slightly year-over-year to 73%, a point better than expected, primarily driven by improvements in Azure. Excluding the impact of the change in\n\naccounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud's gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by the improvement just mentioned in Azure as \nwell as Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Company gross margin dollars increased 16% and 15% \nin constant currency and gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 71%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, the gross margin \npercentage increased roughly 3 points, driven by the improvement in Azure and Office 365 as well as sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. Operating \nexpenses increased 1%, lower than expected due to cost-efficiency focus as well as investments that shifted to future quarters. Operating expense growth was \ndriven by marketing, LinkedIn, and cloud engineering, partially offset by devices. At a total company level, headcount at the end of September was 7% lower than \na year ago. Operating income increased 25% and 24% in constant currency. Operating margins increased roughly 5 points year-over-year to 48%. Excluding the \nimpact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 6 six points, driven by improved operating leverage through cost management \nand the higher gross margin noted earlier. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $18.6 billion and grew 13% and \n12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected results in Office 365 Commercial and LinkedIn. Office Commercial revenue grew \n15% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 18% and 17% in constant currency, slightly better than expected with a bit more \nin-period revenue recognition, while billings remained relatively in line with expectations. Growth continues to be driven by healthy renewal execution and ARPU \ngrowth, as E5 momentum remains strong. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats grew 10% year-over-year, with installed-base expansion across all customer \nsegments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings with continued impact from the growth trends in new \nstandalone business noted earlier. Office Commercial licensing declined 17%, in line with the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office Consumer \nrevenue increased 3% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 18% to 76.7 million. LinkedIn revenue \nincreased 8%, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance across all businesses. Growth was driven by Talent Solutions, though \nwe continue to see negative year-over-year bookings there from the weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Dynamics revenue, grew 22% and 21% in \nconstant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 28% and 26% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin \ndollars increased 13% and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin \npercentage increased roughly, 1 point, driven by improvements in Office 365. Operating expenses increased to 2% and operating income increased 20% and \n19% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $24.3 billion, increasing 19% and ahead of expectations, with better-than-expected \nresults across all businesses. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue grew 21%. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 29% and 28% in \nconstant currency, including roughly 3 points from AI Services. While the trends from prior quarter continued, growth was ahead of expectations, primarily driven \nby increased GPU capacity and better-than-expected GPU utilization of our AI services, as well as slightly higher-than-expected growth in our per-user business. \nIn our per user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base, grew 11% to over 259 million seats with continued impact from the growth trends in \nnew standalone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 2% ahead of expectations, driven primarily by demand in advance \nof Windows Server 2012 end of support. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency ahead of \nexpectations, driven by a better-than-expected performance in Enterprise Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant \ncurrency and gross margin percentage increased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly \n2 points, driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even as we scale our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Operating expenses increased 2% \nand 1% in constant currency, operating income grew 31% and 30% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing, revenue was $13.7 billion, increasing \n3% and 2% in constant currency, above expectations, with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Windows OEM revenue increased 4% \nyear-over-year, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected consumer channel inventory builds and the stabilizing PC market demand \nnoted earlier, particularly in commercial. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 8%, driven by demand for Microsoft 365 E5. \nDevices revenue decreased 22%, ahead of expectations due to stronger execution in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue, ex-TAC \nincreased 10% and 9% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. We saw increased engagement on Bing and Edge share gains again this quarter, \nalthough search revenue growth continues to be impacted by a third-party partnership. And in gaming, revenue increased 9% and 8% in constant currency, \nahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected subscriber growth in Xbox Game Pass as well as first-party content, primarily due to the Starfield launch. \nXbox content and services revenue increased 13% and 12% in constant currency and Xbox hardware revenue declined 7% and 8% in constant currency. \nSegment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 5 points year-over-year, driven \nprimarily by sales mix-shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses declined 1% and operating income increased 23% and 22% in constant currency. \nNow back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases were $11.2 billion to support cloud demand, including investments to scale our \nAI infrastructure. Cash paid for PP&E was $9.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was $30.6 billion, up 32% year-over-year, driven by strong cloud billings and \ncollections. Free cash flow was $20.7 billion, up 22% year-over-year. This quarter, other income and expense was $389 million, higher-than-anticipated, driven by \ninterest income, partially offset by net losses on investments and foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we \nreturned $9.1 billion to shareholders, through share repurchases and dividends. Now moving to our Q2 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise is on a \nU.S. dollar basis. The Activision acquisition closed on October 13. So my commentary includes the net impact of the deal from the date of acquisition. Our outlook \nincludes purchase accounting impact, integration, and transaction-related expenses based on our current understanding of the purchase price allocation and \nrelated deal accounting. The net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party. \nNow to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment-level revenue growth by approximately 1 point. We expect FX to have \nno impact to COGS and operating expense growth. In commercial bookings, we expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions, including \nhealthy renewals. The growth will be impacted by a low growth expiry base. Therefore, we expect bookings growth to be relatively flat. Microsoft Cloud gross \nmargin percentage to be relatively flat year-over-year, excluding the impact from the accounting estimate change, Q2 Cloud gross margin percentage will be up \nroughly 1 point, primarily driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. \nWe expect capital expenditures to increase sequentially on a dollar basis, driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure. As a reminder, there can be \nnormal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure buildout. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect \nrevenue to grow between 11% and 12% or $18.8 billion to $19.1 billion. Growth in constant currency will be approximately 1 point lower. In Office Commercial, \nrevenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue \ngrowth to be up roughly 16% in constant currency. We're excited for Microsoft 365 Copilot general availability on November 1st, and expect the related revenue to \ngrow gradually over time. In our on-premise business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-to-high teens. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in \nthe mid-single-digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single-digits, driven by Talent Solutions and \nMarketing Solutions. Growth continues to be impacted by the overall market environment for recruiting and advertising, especially in the technology industry, \nwhere we have significant exposure. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the high teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect \nrevenue to grow between 17% and 18% or $25.1 billion to $25.4 billion. Revenue growth in constant currency will be approximately 1 point lower. Revenue will \ncontinue to be driven by Azure, which as a reminder can have quarterly variability, primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition, \ndepending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect revenue growth to be 26% to 27% in constant currency, with an increasing contribution from AI. Growth \ncontinues to be driven by Azure consumption business and we expect the trends from Q1 to continue into Q2. Our per user business should continue to benefit \nfrom Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates, given the size of the installed base. For H2, assuming the\n\noptimization and new workload trends continue and with the growing contribution from AI, we expect Azure revenue growth in constant currency to remain roughly\nstable compared to Q2. And our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth to be roughly flat with continued hybrid demand, particularly from\nlicenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in enterprise and partner services, revenue should decline by low-to-mid single digits. Now to more Personal\nComputing, which includes the net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect revenue of $16.5 billion to $16.9 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth\nshould be mid-to-high single digits with PC market unit volumes expected to look roughly similar to Q1. In devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we\ncontinue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our\nadvanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the low-to-mid teens. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be mid-single\ndigits with roughly 4 points of negative impact from a third-party partnership. Growth should be driven by volume strength, supported by Edge browser share\ngains and increasing Bing engagement, as we expect the advertising spend environment to be similar to Q1. A reminder that this ex-TAC growth will be roughly 4\npoints higher than overall search and news advertising revenue. And in gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high 40s. This includes roughly 35 points\nof net impact from the Activision acquisition, which as a reminder includes adjusting for the third-party to first-party content change noted earlier. We expect Xbox\ncontent and services revenue growth in the mid-to-high 50s, driven by roughly 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Now back to company\nguidance. We expect COGS between $19.4 billion to $19.6 billion, including approximately $500 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets from the\nActivision acquisition. We expect operating expense of $15.5 billion to $15.6 billion, including approximately $400 million from purchase accounting adjustments,\nintegration and transaction-related cost from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $500 million, as interest income will\nbe more than offset by interest expense, primarily due to a reduction in our investment portfolio balance and the issuance of short-term debt, both for the\nActivision acquisition. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect\nour Q2 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. Now, some additional thoughts on H2 as well as the full fiscal year. First, FX, assuming current rates\nremain stable, we expect FX to have no meaningful impact to full year revenue COGS or operating expense growth. Therefore, in H2, we expect FX to decrease\nrevenue COGS and operating expense growth by 1 point. Second, Activision, we expect approximately $900 million for purchase accounting adjustments as well\nas integration and transaction-related costs in each quarter in H2. For a full FY '24, we remain committed to investing for the cloud and AI opportunity, while also\nmaintaining our disciplined focus on operating leverage. Therefore, as we add the net impact of Activision, inclusive of purchase accounting adjustments as well\nas integration and transaction-related expenses, we continue to expect full year operating margins to remain flat year-over-year. In closing, with our strong start to\nFY '24, I am confident that as a team, we will continue to deliver healthy growth in the year ahead, driven by our leadership in commercial cloud and our\ncommitment to lead the AI platform wave.

Thank you for taking the question and very nice quarter. The pace of innovation you guys have been putting out has been pretty amazing. And the new\nproducts garnering traction probably faster than we've expected on our side of the equation. But we're also working in an overall spending environment, that\nremains volatile, and I think investors are getting more concerned on it. So two questions on this, one, based on sort of the new products and the innovation, do\nyou think you guys can sustain the type of commercial growth that we saw in Q1 as we go through the year or is the environment too tricky for that? And then\nwhen it relates to investment, Amy, you've been able to keep overall OpEx growth very low, and it was very low this quarter.

Overall there are multiple things, Keith, they're all happening obviously simultaneously. If you just take Azure\nand try to characterize, where's the growth for Azure coming from or what sort of drivers for Azure numbers, there are three things all happening in parallel. Like,\nfor example, take cloud migrations. A good reminder of where we are and even the core cloud migration story is the new Oracle announcement. Once we\nannounced that the Oracle databases are going to be available on Azure, we saw a bunch of unlock from new customers who have significant Oracle estates that\nhave not yet moved to the cloud because they needed to rendezvous with the rest of the app estate in one single cloud. And so we're excited about that. So in\nsome sense, even the financial services sector, for example, is a good place where there's a lot of Oracle that still needs to move to the cloud. The second thing,\nof course, is the workloads start, then workloads get optimized, and then new workloads start, and that cycle continues. We'll lap some of those optimization\ncycles that were fairly extreme perhaps in the second half of our fiscal. And the third thing is, for us, that's unique and different is new workload starts around AI.\nGiven our leadership position, we are seeing complete new projects start, which are AI projects. And as you know, AI projects are not just about AI meters, they\nhave lots of other cloud meters as well. So that sort of gives you one side of what's happening in terms of enterprise. The other piece is on the SaaS side,\nobviously, again, this is a new product that's going to go through the enterprise adoption cycle. The results around productivity, which we demonstrated with\nGitHub Copilot, is what's giving us good confidence and our customers, more importantly, good confidence around what these products represent in terms of\nvalue. And so we are in the very early innings there, and so we look forward to seeing the traction for these products going forward.", "char_count": 2047, "word_count": 356, "token_count": 429, "exchange_id": "ex_001", "exchange_role": "answer"}

In general, we saw very \nconsistent execution from Q4 to Q1, and that's what we're talking about into Q2. I think that speaks to our value prop, which is where Satya went. It speaks to \nmaking sure that customers are getting a very quick return on value, real productivity improvement, real savings, so that when we're asking at renewal or talking \nabout E5 upgrades or talking about AI services, that those come with real promises of high-value scenarios. And so I think that is an important piece as you think \nabout, stability and commercial demand. And then if you think about the nature of your question, it was partially why I talked about in my full-year guidance that, \nnow, even with the addition of Activision and purchase accounting impacts, and integration impacts, we still feel confident we can deliver consistent operating \nmargins to last year. And it speaks to, I think, some of the improvements, we're making in Azure and even in Microsoft 365 gross margins, even in the core of the \ncommercial cloud. It speaks to the pace at which we are delivering AI revenue with the increasing cost expense and capital investment ahead with the demand \nwe see. And, although you're right, our operating expense comparables in H2 get more challenging than in H1, we're really focused on making sure that every\n\ndollar we put and commit is back to the priorities we talked about, which is commercial cloud leadership and leading the AI wave.

Yeah, it is true that we have -- the approach we have taken is a full stack approach all the way from whether it's ChatGPT\nor Bing Chat or all our Copilots, all share the same model.

And that advantage sort of trickles down all the way to both utilization\ninternally, utilization of third parties, and also over time, you can see the sort of stack optimization all the way to the silicon because the abstraction layer to which\nthe developers are riding is much higher up than low-level kernels if you will. So, therefore, I think there is a fundamental approach we took, which was a technical\napproach of saying we'll have Copilots and Copilot stack all available. That doesn't mean we don't have people doing training for open source models or\nproprietary models. We also have a bunch of open source models. We have a bunch of fine-tuning happening, a bunch of RLHF happening. So there's all kinds\nof ways people use it.

The team continues to deliver thoughtful gross margin improvement across both technical decisions, software implementations. Our\nteams on the infrastructure build side have done really good work to deliver that, and so that's been helpful as well. And then, of course, on operating expenses,\nthere's been a good focus on continuing even within that segment, to make sure we're focusing that work on leading in the AI transition with Azure. And so you're\nright, even as we're investing in AI infrastructure, which will and should show up as revenue, it'll also show up in COGS and still deliver good margin.

Let me break that into two components, because they're both important and it's a really good question, Gregg. On our core business, the core Azure \nbusiness, the core Office 365, M365 business, Dynamics business, they're -- they continue to deliver gross margin year-over-year improvements in the core. And \nso that, like in other quarters has helped this quarter. In addition, what Satya mentioned earlier in a question, and I just want to take every chance to reiterate it, if \nyou have a consistent infrastructure from the platform all the way up through its layers, then every capital dollar we spend, if we optimize revenue against it, we \nwill have great leverage, because wherever demand shows up in the layers, whether it's at the SaaS layer, whether it's at the infrastructure layer, whether it's for \ntraining workloads, we're able to quickly put our infrastructure to work generating revenue, or on our Bing workloads. I mean, I should have mentioned all the \nconsumer workloads use the same frame. And so when you think about our investment in AI, yes, it will -- because we're committed to leading this wave and see \ndemand, you will see that impact in COGS growth. But what we're committed to doing is making sure it's highly leveraged and making sure you see the same\n\ngrowth in revenue. And I think on occasion, you may see something pick up 1 or 2 points and the other one not quite get there, but the point is, it's going to be\nvery well paired because of the choices we've made over the past, frankly, numerous years, to get to a point where that infrastructure is consistent.", "char_count": 1601, "word_count": 277, "token_count": 351, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}
