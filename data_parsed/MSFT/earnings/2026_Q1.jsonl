It was a very strong start to our fiscal year. Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $49 billion, up 26% year-over-year. And our commercial \nRPO increased over 50% to nearly $400 billion with a weighted average duration of only 2 years. We are seeing increasing demand and diffusion of our AI \nplatform and family of Copilots, which is fueling our investments across both capital and talent. When it comes to infrastructure, we're building a planet scale \ncloud and an AI factory, maximizing tokens per dollar per watt while supporting the sovereignty needs of customers and countries. We are innovating rapidly \nacross the family of Copilots spanning the high-value domains of information work, coding, security, science, health and consumer. And as you saw yesterday, \nwe closed a new definitive agreement with OpenAI, marking the next chapter in what is one of the most successful partnerships and investments our industry has \never seen. This is a great milestone for both companies and we continue to benefit mutually from each other's growth across multiple dimensions. Already, we \nhave roughly 10x-ed our investment. OpenAI has contracted an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, our rev share, exclusive IP rights and API exclusivity \nfor Azure continue until AGI or through 2030. And we have extended the model and product IP rights through 2032. And we are also energized to innovate and \npursue AI advancements with both talent and compute investments that have real-world impact. With that, let's turn to our momentum across our AI platform and \nCopilots as well as with agents. We have the most expansive data center fleet for the AI era, and we are adding capacity at an unprecedented scale. We will \nincrease our total AI capacity by over 80% this year and roughly double our total data center footprint over the next 2 years, reflecting the demand signals we see. \nJust this quarter, we announced the world's most powerful AI data center, Fairwater in Wisconsin, which will go online next year and scale to 2 gigawatts alone. \nAnd we have deployed the world's first large-scale cluster of NVIDIA GB300s. We are building a fungible fleet that's been continuously modernized and spans all \nstages of the AI life cycle from pretraining to post training to synthetic data generation and inference. And it also goes beyond GenAI workloads to \nrecommendation engines, databases and streaming. We're optimizing this fleet across silicon systems and software to maximize performance and efficiency. It's \nthis combination of fungibility and continuous optimization that allows us to deliver the best ROI and TCO for us and our customers. For example, during the \nquarter, we increased the token throughput for GPT-4.1 and GPT-5, two of the most widely used models by over 30% per GPU. We also have the most \ncomprehensive digital sovereignty platform. Azure customers in 33 countries are now developing their own cloud and AI capabilities within their borders to meet \nlocal data residency requirements. In Germany, for example, OpenAI and SAP will rely on Azure to deliver new AI solutions to the public sector. On top of this \ninfrastructure, we are building Azure AI Foundry to help customers build their own AI apps and agents. We have 80,000 customers, including 80% of the Fortune \n500. We offer developers and enterprise access to over 11,000 models more than any other vendor, including as of this quarter, OpenAI's GPT-5 as well as xAI's \nGrok 4. For example, Ralph Lauren used Foundry to build conversational shopping experience in its app, enabling customers to describe what they're looking for \nand get personalized recommendations. And OpenEvidence used Foundry to create its AI-powered clinical assistant which surfaces relevant medical information \nto physicians and help streamline charting. When it comes to our first-party models, we are excited by the performance of our new MAI models for text, voice and \nimage generation, which debuted among the top in the industry leader boards. And we continue to make great progress with our Phi family of SLMs, which now \nhave been downloaded over 60 million times, up 3x year-over-year. Beyond models in Foundry, we are providing everything developers need to design, \ncustomize and manage AI applications and agents at scale. Our new Microsoft Agent Framework helps developers orchestrate multi-agent systems with \ncompliance, observability and deep integration out of the box. For example, KPMG used the framework to modernize the audit process, connecting agents to \ninternal data with enterprise-grade governance and observability. These kinds of real production scale AI deployments are driving Azure's overall growth. And \nonce again, this quarter, Azure took share. Now let's turn to applications and agents we ourselves are building on this platform. We now have 900 million monthly \nactive users of our AI features across our products. And our first-party family of Copilots now has surpassed 150 million monthly active users across the \ninformation work, coding, security, science, health and consumer. When it comes to information work, we continue to innovate with Microsoft 365 Copilot. Copilot \nis becoming the UI for the agentic AI experience. We have integrated chat and agentic workflows into everyday tools like Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and \nTeams. Just 9 months since release, tens of millions of users across Microsoft 365 customer base are already using chat. Adoption is accelerating rapidly, \ngrowing 50% quarter-over-quarter, and we continue to see usage intensity increased. This quarter, we also introduced Agent Mode, which turns single prompts \ninto export quality Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentation and then iterate to deliver the final product much like agent mode in coding \ntools today. We're thrilled by the early response, including third-party benchmarks that rank it best-in-class. Beyond individual productivity, Copilot is multiplayer, \nwith Teams mode announced this week, you can now invite colleagues into a Copilot conversation. And our collaborative agents like Facilitator and Project\n\nManager, prep meeting agendas, take notes, capture decision, kick off group tasks. We are seeing a growing Copilot agent ecosystem with top ISVs like Adobe,\nAsana, Jira, LexisNexis, SAP, ServiceNow, Snowflake and Workday, all building their own agents that connect to Copilot. And customers are also building agents\nfor their mission-critical business processes and workflows using tools like Copilot Studio and integrating them into Copilot. The overall number of agent users\ndoubled quarter-over-quarter. And just yesterday, we announced App Builder, a new Copilot agent that lets anyone create and deploy task-specific apps and\nagents in minutes grounded in Microsoft 365 context. All this innovation is driving our momentum. Customers continue to adopt Microsoft 365 Copilot at a faster\nrate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite, all up more than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot, Accenture, Bristol-Myers Squibb, EY Global\nand the U.K.'s Tax and Payments and Customs Authority all purchased over 15,000 seats this quarter. Lloyds Banking Group has deployed 30,000 seats, saving\neach employee an average of 46 minutes daily. And a large majority of our enterprise customers continue to come back to purchase more seats. Our partner,\nPwC, alone added 155,000 seats this quarter and now has over 200,000 deployed across its global operations. In just 6 months, PwC employees interacted with\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot over 30 million times, and they credit this agentic transformation with saving millions of hours an employee productivity. When it comes to\ncoding, GitHub Copilot is the most popular AI pair programmer now with over 26 million users. For example, tens of thousands of developers at AMD use GitHub\nCopilot, accepting hundreds of thousands of lines of code suggestions each month and crediting it with saving months of development time. All up, GitHub is now\nhome to over 180 million developers and the platform is growing at the fastest rate in its history, adding a developer every second. 80% of new developers on\nGitHub start with Copilot within the first week. Overall, the rise of AI coding agents is driving record usage with over 500 million pull requests merged over the past\nyear. And just yesterday, at GitHub Universe, we introduced Agent HQ. GitHub Copilot and Agent HQ is the organizing layer for all coding agent, extending\nGitHub privatives like PRs, issues, actions to coding agents from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cognition, xAI as well as OSS and in-house models. GitHub now\nprovides a single mission control to launch, manage and review these agents, each operating from its own branch with built-in controls, observability and\ngovernance. We are building a similar system in security with over 3 dozen agents in Copilot integrated across Entra, Defender, Purview and Intune. For\nexample, with our Phishing Triage Agent in Defender, studies show that analysts can be up to 6.5x more efficient in detecting malicious mails. In health, Dragon\nCopilot helps providers automate critical workflows. This quarter alone, we helped document over 17 million patient encounters, up nearly 5x year-over-year.\nMore than 650 health care organizations have purchased our ambient listening tech to date, including University of Michigan Health where over 1,000 physicians\nare actively using it. Finally, when it comes to AI consumer experiences, we are excited about all the progress Copilot is making, starting with Windows. Every\nWindows 11 PC now is an AI PC. Just 2 weeks ago, we introduced new ways to speak naturally to your computer, including a Copilot wake word. With vision,\nCopilot sees what you see on your screen and you can have a real-time conversation about it. And with action, it takes real action on your behalf, interacting with\nboth web and desktop apps. In Edge, we are introducing first-of-its-kind AI features to automate multistep workflows within the browser and help you pick up right\nwhere you left off. Edge now has taken share for 18 consecutive quarters. In Bing, our overview pages now include embedded conversational capabilities, we\ntook share again in search. And daily users of our Copilot consumer app increased nearly 50% quarter-over-quarter. Among many updates we made last week is\ngroups, which turns Copilot for the first time into a shared experience. We also are creating a great consumer subscription offer with Microsoft 365 premium. It\nbrings together our Office applications and advanced Copilot features with high usage limits, giving individuals the flexibility to bring their own AI to work in a\nsecure way. Finally, in gaming, Copilot provides a voice-first immersive experience across PC, mobile and our new Xbox Ally. Beyond our family of Copilots and\nAI platform, we are seeing strong momentum across the portfolio. Cloud migrations are accelerating. In data and analytics, Fabric revenue grew 60%, which is\nfaster than any other data and analytics platform in the industry. We now have 28,000 paid Fabric customers. In databases, SQL, DB, hyperscale revenue was up\nnearly 75%, 50% in Cosmos DB. In Business Applications, Dynamics 365 gained share. In security, our end-to-end stack is now informed by 100 trillion daily\nsignals. 1 billion monthly active users of Entra, 16 billion Copilot interactions audited by Purview, up 72% quarter-over-quarter. 40,000 Sentinel customers, and\nwe took share across all categories we serve in security. In LinkedIn, nearly 1.3 billion members. And finally, in gaming, we expanded our reach across every\nendpoint focused on our high-margin content and services. We launched critically acclaimed games like Keeper, Ninja Gaiden 4 and Outer Worlds 2, reaching\n155 million monthly active users. Minecraft, an all-time high, and set new record for overall content and services revenue for the quarter. We also saw a great\nresponse to Xbox Ally launch 2 weeks ago and set new records for players on PC. In closing, our planet-scale Cloud and AI factory together with Copilots across\nhigh-value domains is driving broad diffusion and real-world impact. And we continue to increase our investments in AI across both capital and talent to meet the\nmassive opportunity ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Amy to walk through our financial results and outlook, and I look forward to rejoining for your\nquestions.", "char_count": 12496, "word_count": 1974, "token_count": 2630, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

First, as you heard from Satya, we were pleased to announce the next phase of our partnership with OpenAI \nyesterday. They continue to choose Microsoft to power their workloads. And together, we remain committed to driving innovation that meets real-world needs. \nOur Q1 results were not impacted by the deal signed this week. Now on to the quarter, we delivered a strong start to our fiscal year, exceeding expectations \nacross revenue, operating income and earnings per share. We also saw continued share gains across many of our businesses, demonstrating our leadership \nposition in key markets. This quarter, revenue was $77.7 billion, up 18% and 17% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 16% in constant \ncurrency, while operating income increased 24% and 22% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $4.13 and an increase of 23% and 21% in constant \ncurrency when adjusted for the impact of our investments in OpenAI. FX impact was roughly in line with guidance. Company gross margin percentage was 69%, \ndown slightly year-over-year, driven by investments in AI, including the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure and the growing usage of our AI product features. \nThis was partially offset by ongoing efficiency gains, particularly in Azure and M365 Commercial cloud. Operating expenses increased 5% and 4% in constant \ncurrency, driven by investments in Cloud and AI engineering, including compute capacity and AI talent to support product development across the portfolio. \nOperating margins increased year-over-year to 49% and were ahead of expectations with stronger-than-anticipated results and high-margin businesses this \nquarter. When adjusted for the impact from our investments in OpenAI, other income and expense was $401 million as interest income more than offset interest \nexpense, which includes the interest of payments related to data center finance leases. Capital expenditures were $34.9 billion, driven by growing demand for our \nCloud and AI offerings. This quarter, roughly half of our spend was on short-lived assets, primarily GPUs and CPUs, to support increasing Azure platform \ndemand, growing first-party apps at AI solutions, accelerating R&D by our product teams as well as continued replacement for end-of-life server and networking \nequipment. The remaining spend was for long-lived assets that will support monetization for the next 15 years and beyond, including $11.1 billion of finance \nleases that are primarily for large data center sites. And cash paid for PP&E was $19.4 billion. As a reminder, the difference between total CapEx and cash paid \nfor PP&E is primarily due to finance leases as well as the normal timing of goods received, but not yet paid. Cash flow from operations was $45.1 billion, up 32%, \ndriven by strong Cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier payments. And free cash flow increased 33% to $25.7 billion with minimal impact \nfrom a sequential increase in CapEx, given the higher mix of finance leases. And finally, we returned $10.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share \nrepurchases. Now to our commercial results. Commercial bookings increased 112% and 111% in constant currency and were significantly ahead of expectations, \ndriven by Azure commitments from OpenAI as well as continued growth in the number of $100 million-plus contracts for both Azure and M365. These results do \nnot include any impact from the incremental $250 billion Azure commitments from OpenAI announced yesterday. Commercial remaining performance obligation \nincreased to $392 billion and was up 51% year-over-year. The balance has nearly doubled over the past 2 years. And even with this growth, our weighted \naverage duration has been relatively stable at approximately 2 years. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $49.1 billion, ahead of expectations and grew 26% and 25%\n\nin constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was slightly better than expected at 68% and down year-over-year due to the investments in AI\nthat were partially offset by ongoing efficiency gains as noted earlier. Now to segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $33 billion\nand grew 17% and 14% in constant currency. M365 Commercial Cloud revenue increased 17% and 15% in constant currency with 1 point of benefit from\nin-period revenue recognition. Year-over-year growth was driven by both ARPU and seats with ARPU growth again led by E5 and M365 Copilot. Paid M365\nCommercial seats grew 6% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments though primarily in our small and medium businesses and\nfrontline worker offerings. M365 Commercial Products revenue increased 17% and 14% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to higher-than-expected\nOffice 2024 transactional purchasing. M365 Consumer Cloud revenue increased 26% and 25% in constant currency, again driven by ARPU growth. M365\nconsumer subscriptions grew 7% to over 90 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency driven by Marketing Solutions. The Talent\nSolutions business was impacted by continued weakness in the hiring market. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 18% and 16% in constant currency with\ncontinued growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 19% and 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased\ndriven by efficiency gains in M365 Commercial Cloud that were partially offset by investments in AI including the impact of growing usage in M365 Copilot chat.\nOperating expenses increased 6% and 5% in constant currency, and operating income increased 24% and 20% in constant currency. Operating margins\nincreased 3 points year-over-year to 62%, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier as well as improved operating leverage. Next, the Intelligent Cloud\nsegment. Revenue was $30.9 billion and grew 28% and 27% in constant currency. In Azure and other Cloud services, where we continue to see accelerating\ndemand, revenue grew 40% and 39% in constant currency. Results were ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected growth in our core infrastructure\nbusiness, primarily from our largest customers. Azure AI services revenue was generally in line with expectations, and this quarter, demand again exceeded\nsupply across workloads, even as we brought more capacity online. In our on-premise server business, revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in\nconstant currency. Results were ahead of expectations, driven by transactional purchasing of Windows Server 2025. Segment gross margin dollars increased\n20% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased year-over-year, driven by investments in AI that were partially offset by efficiency\ngains in Azure. Operating expenses increased 4% and operating income grew 27%. Operating margins were 43%, down only slightly year-over-year as increased\ninvestments in AI were mostly offset by improved operating leverage. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.8 billion and grew 4%. Windows OEM\nand Devices revenue increased 6% year-over-year, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by strong demand ahead of Windows 10 end of support as well as\na benefit from inventory levels that remain elevated. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, driven by\ngrowth in volume as well as the continued benefit from third-party partnerships that was better than expected. And in gaming, revenue decreased 2% and 3% in\nconstant currency against a strong prior year comparable. Xbox content and services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency,\ndriven by better-than-expected performance from third-party content. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11% and 10% in constant currency, and gross\nmargin percentage increased year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 4% and 3% in constant\ncurrency, and operating income increased 18% and 16% in constant currency. Operating margins increased 3 points year-over-year to 30% driven by the higher\ngross margin noted earlier. Now moving to our Q2 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. Based on current rates, we expect\nFX to increase total revenue growth by 2 points. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by 2 points in Productivity and Business\nProcesses and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth by 1 point. Starting\nwith the total company, we expect revenue of USD 79.5 billion to USD 80.6 billion or growth of 14% to 16%. We expect COGS of USD 26.35 billion to USD 26.55\nbillion or growth of 21% to 22%. And operating expense of USD 17.3 billion to USD 17.4 billion, growth of 7% to 8%. Operating margins should be relatively flat\nyear-over-year and down sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality. Now other income and expense. The combination of OpenAI's conversion to a public\nbenefit corp and the ongoing nature of our partnership will result in increased volatility. Therefore, going forward, we'll provide our outlook, excluding any impact\nfrom our investments in OpenAI. On that basis, in Q2, other income and expense is estimated to be roughly $100 million as interest income will more than offset\ninterest expense. And we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. Next, capital expenditures. With accelerating demand and a growing RPO\nbalance, we're increasing our spend on GPUs and CPUs. Therefore, total spend will increase sequentially, and we now expect the FY '26 growth rate to be higher\nthan FY '25. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next, our\ncommercial business. In commercial bookings, we expect healthy growth in the core business on a low expiry base when adjusted for the OpenAI contracts in the\nprior year. And we expect commercial bookings will be positively impacted by the significant OpenAI commitments announced yesterday. As a reminder, larger\nlong-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross\nmargin percentage should be roughly 66%, down year-over-year, driven by the continued investments in AI as well as the mix shift to Azure. Now to segment\nguidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of USD 33.3 billion to USD 33.6 billion or growth of 13% to 14%. In M365 Commercial\nCloud, we expect revenue growth to be between 13% and 14% in constant currency, with business trends that remain relatively stable quarter-over-quarter.\nARPU growth will again be driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. M365 Commercial products revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits. As a reminder,\nM365 Commercial products includes components that can be variable due to the in-period revenue recognition dynamics. M365 Consumer cloud revenue growth\nshould be in the mid-20s driven by growth in ARPU. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue\ngrowth to be in the mid- to high teens with continued growth across all workloads. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of USD 32.25 billion to USD 32.55\nbillion or growth of 26% to 27%. In Azure, we expect Q2 revenue growth of approximately 37% in constant currency as demand remains significantly ahead of the\ncapacity we have available. And while we're accelerating the amount of capacity we're bringing online, we will continue to balance Azure revenue growth with the\ngrowing needs across our first-party apps and AI solutions, our own R&D efforts and the end-of-life server replacements. Therefore, we now expect to be capacity\nconstrained through at least the end of our fiscal year. As a reminder, there can be quarterly variability in the year-on-year growth rates depending on the timing\nof capacity delivery and when it comes online as well as from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In our on-premises server\nbusiness, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits with ongoing customer shift to cloud offerings. In More Personal Computing. We expect\nrevenue to be in the USD 13.95 billion to USD 14.45 billion. Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the mid-single digits. We expect continued\nmomentum from Windows 10 end of support, although growth rates will be impacted by elevated inventory levels at the end of Q1 that we expect to come down\nthrough the quarter. Therefore, Windows OEM revenue should decline low to mid-single digits. The range of potential outcomes remains wider than normal.\nDevices revenue should decline year-over-year. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low double digits, down sequentially as\ngrowth rates normalize following the benefit from third-party partnerships noted earlier. Growth will continue to be driven by volume and revenue per search\nacross Edge and Bing. And in Xbox content and services, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits against the prior year comparable that\nbenefited from strong first-party performance, partially offset by growth in subscriptions. And hardware revenue should decline year-over-year. And in closing,\ndemand signals across bookings, RPO and product usage are accelerating faster than we expected. We're investing in infrastructure, AI talent and product\ninnovation to capture that momentum and expand our leadership position. And we remain focused on delivering real value to our customers that results in durable\nrevenue growth for the long term.

But\nbeyond that, I think your question touches on something that's pretty important, which is how are these AI systems going to truly be deployed in the real world and\nmake a real difference and make a return for both the customers who are deploying them and then obviously, the providers of these systems. And I think the best\nway to characterize the situation is that even as the intelligence capability increases, let's even say, exponentially like model version over model version, the\nproblem is it's always going to still be jagged, right? I think the term people use is the jagged intelligence, even -- or spiky intelligence, right? So you may even\nhave a capability that's fantastic at a particular task, but it may not uniformly grow. So what is required is in fact, these systems, whether it is GitHub Agent HQ or\nthe M365 Copilot system. Don't think of this as a product. Think of it as a system that in some sense smooths out those jagged edges, and really helps the\ncapability. I mean just to give you a flavor for it, right? So if I am in M365 Copilot, I can generate an Excel spreadsheet. The good news is now an Excel\nspreadsheet does understand Office JS, has the formulas in it. It feels like, wow, it is a great spreadsheet created by a good model. The more interesting thing is I\ncan go into agent mode in Excel and iterate on that model. And yet, it will stay on rail. It won't go off rail, it will be able to do the iteration. Then I can even give it to\nthe analyst agent, and then it will even make sense of it like a data analyst would of our Excel model. The reason I say all of that is because that's the type of\nconstruction that will be needed even when the model is magical, all powerful. I think we will be in this jagged intelligence phase for a long time. So one of the\nfundamental things that these -- whether it's GitHub, whether it's security, whether it's M365, the 3 main domains we're in, we feel very, very good about building\nthese as organizing layers for agents to help customers. And by the way, that's the same thing that we want to put into Foundry for our third-party customers. So\nthat's kind of how people will build these multi-agent systems. So I feel actually pretty good about both the progress in AI. I don't think AGI as defined at least by\nus in our contract is ever going to be achieved anytime soon. But I do believe we can drive a lot of value for customers with advances in AI models by building\nthese systems. So it's kind of the real question that needs to be well understood. And I feel very, very confident about our ability to make progress.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.", "char_count": 3008, "word_count": 562, "token_count": 688, "exchange_id": "ex_001", "exchange_role": "answer"}

A couple of things to maybe take a step back on RPO. With a nearly $400 billion balance, we've been trying to help people understand sort of how\nto think about really the breadth of that. It covers numerous products. It covers customers of all sizes. It -- that's been a balance that we've been growing\nobviously at a good clip. But what people need to realize is it sits across multiple products because of the things Satya is talking about around creating systems\nand where we're investing. And if you're going to have that type of balance and then more importantly, have the weighted average duration be 2 years, it means\nthat most of that is being consumed in relatively short order. People are not consuming, and I say this broadly, unless there's value. And I think this is why we\nkeep coming back to, are we creating real-world value in our AI platforms, in our AI solutions and apps and systems. And so I think the sort of the way to think\nabout RPO is it's been building across a number of customers. We're thrilled to have OpenAI be a piece of that. We're learning a ton and building leading systems\nbecause of it that are being used at scale that benefits every other customer. And so it's why we've tried to give a little bit more color to that RPO balance\nbecause I do understand that there have been a lot of concerns or questions about is it long dated, is it coming over a long period of time. And hopefully, this is\nhelpful for people to realize that these are contracts being signed by customers who intend to use it in relatively short order.

Let me talk a little bit about maybe connecting a couple of the dots because with $400 billion of RPO, that's sort of\nshort-dated as we talked about, our needs to continue to build out the infrastructure is very high. And that's for booked business today. That is not any new\nbooked business we started trying to accomplish on October 1, right? And so the way to think about that, and you saw it this quarter in particular, and as we\ntalked about '26, the remainder, number one, we're pivoting toward -- increasingly, we talked about this short-lived assets, both GPUs and CPUs, Again, we talk\nabout all these workloads are burning both in terms of app building. Now when that happens, short-lived assets generally are done to match sort of the duration of\nthe contracts or the duration of your expectation of those contracts. And so I sometimes think when people think about risk, they're not realizing that most of the\nlifetimes of these and the lifetime of the contracts are very similar. And so when you think about having revenue and the bookings and coming on the balance\nsheet, the depreciation of short-lived assets, they're actually quite matched, Mark. And as you know, we've spent the past few years not actually being short\nGPUs and CPUs per se, we were short the space or the power is the language we used to put them in. So we spent a lot of time building out that infrastructure.\nNow we're continuing to do that also using leases. Those are very long-lived assets, as we've talked about 15 to 20 years. And over that period of time, do I have\nconfidence that we'll need to use all of that, it is very high. And so when I think about sort of balancing those things, seeing the pivot to GPU, CPU short-lived,\nseeing the pivot in terms of how those are being utilized, we are -- and I said this now, we've been short now for many quarters. I thought we were going to catch\nup, we are not. Demand is increasing. It is not increasing in just one place. It is increasing across many places. We're seeing usage increases in products. We\nare seeing new products launch that are getting increasing usage, and increasing usage very quickly. When people see real value, they actually commit real\nusage. And I sometimes think this is where this cycle needs to be thought through completely is that when you see these kind of demand signals and we know\nwe're behind, we do need to spend. But we're spending with a different amount of confidence in usage patterns and in bookings, and I feel very good about that. I\nhave said we are now likely to be short capacity to serve the most important things we need to do, which is Azure, our first-party applications. We need to invest\nin product R&D and we're doing end-of-life replacements in the fleet. So we're going to spend to make sure that happens. It's about modernization. It's about high\nquality. It's about service delivery, and it's about meeting demand.

The only thing I would add to what Amy captured was, if you sort of look out, there are 2 things that matter, I think, and that are critical in terms of how we\nthink about our allocation of capital, also our R&D. One is how efficient is our planet-scale token factory, right? I mean that's at the end of the day, what you have\nto do. And in order to do that, you have to start with building out a very fungible fleet. It's not like we're building one data center in one region in the world that's\nmega scale. We are building it out across the globe for inference, for pre-training, for post-training, for RL, for data [indiscernible] or what have you. So therefore,\nthat's the fungibility is super important. The second thing that we're also doing is continually modernizing the fleet. It's not like we buy one version of, say, NVIDIA\nand load up for all the gigawatts we have. Each year, you buy, you write the Moore's Law, you continuously modernize and depreciate it. And that means you\nalso use software to grow efficiency. I talked about, I think, 30% improvement on both serving up GPT-4.1 and 5.0, right? That's software. That's sort of -- and by\nthe way, it's helpful on A100s, it's helpful on GB200s, and it will be helpful on GB300s. That's the beauty of having the efficiency of the fleet. So keep improving\nutilization, keep improving the efficiency. So that's what you do in the token factory. The other aspect, which Amy spoke to is we have some of the best agent\nsystems that matter in the high-value domains, right? It's in information work. That's the Copilot system. Coding, I mean, I should also say one of the things I like\nabout Copilot is, I mean, Copilot ARPU is compared to M365 ARPUs, right? It's expansive. The same thing that happened between server and cloud like we used\nto always say, well, is it zero-sum, it turned out that the cloud was so much more expansive to the server market. The same thing is happening in AI because first,\nyou could say, hey, our ARPUs are too low when it comes to M365 or you could say we have the opportunity with AI to be much more expansive. Same thing with\ntools, right? I mean, tooling -- the tools business was not like a leading business, whereas coding business is going to be one of the most expansive AI systems.\nAnd so we feel very good about being in that category. Same thing with security, same thing with health. So we have -- and in consumer, one of the things is it's\nnot just about ads, it's ads plus subscriptions that also opens up opportunity for us. So when I look at the entirety of these high-value agent systems and when we\nlook at the efficiency of and fungibility of our fleet, that's what gives us the confidence to invest, both the capital and the R&D talent to go after this opportunity.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS.", "char_count": 2856, "word_count": 524, "token_count": 687, "exchange_id": "ex_003", "exchange_role": "answer"}

Maybe I'll start and then Amy, you can add. I mean it goes back a little bit, Mark, to what I said about building first, the asset itself such that it's most fungible.\nAnd then to recognize the strength of even sort of our portfolio, we have a third-party business, we have a first-party business, we have third-party also spread\nbetween enterprise, digital natives, I always felt that we need a balance there because it may start with digital natives. They're always going to be the early\nadopters. You always have the hit app of the generation. And then -- essentially then it spreads throughout. The enterprise adoption cycle is just starting and so\ntherefore, having the -- over the arc of time, I think that third-party balance of customers will only increase. But it's great to have the hit first-party apps in the\nbeginning because you can build scale that then if it's a fungible and that's where the key is. You don't want to build for a digital native in -- as if you're just doing\nhosting for them. You want to build. That's where -- I think some of the decision-making of ours is probably getting better understood. What do we say yes to,\nwhat do we say no to. I think there was a lot of confusion, hopefully by now, anyone who switched on would figure this out. And so that's, I think, one thing we're\ndoing on the third party. But the 1 -- first party is probably where a lot of our leverage comes and it's not even about one hit app on our first-party even. Our\nportfolio of stuff which I just walked through in the earlier answer, gives us, again, the confidence that between that mix, we will be able to use our fleet to the\nmaximum. And remember, these assets, especially the data centers and so on are long assets, right? There will be many refresh cycles for any one of these\nwhen it comes to the gear.

It's the\nadoption of security features. It's the GitHub momentum. And so when you're thinking about it, that is where and it is a priority for us to allocate resourcing there\nfirst. And so you are right to ask how do I think about that. We've worked very hard to try to mitigate it as best we can, but we have been short in Azure, and we've\nbeen clear on it.
