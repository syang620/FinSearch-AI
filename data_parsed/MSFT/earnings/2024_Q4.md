## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Keith Weiss (Morgan Stanley)**: Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question and congratulations on another great quarter and really solid overall fiscal year. Right now, there's a industry
debate raging around the CapEx requirements around Generative AI and whether the monetization is actually going to match with that. And I think the question
for you guys, from a Microsoft perspective, is CapEx still an appropriate leading indicator for cloud growth? Or does the shift in gross margin profile change that
equation? Or said another way, maybe can you give us a little bit more help in understanding the timing between the CapEx investments and the yield on those
investments? Thank you.

**Satya Nadella (CEO)**: Thank you, Keith. Let me start, and then Amy can add to this. I think, I would say we primarily start right now from the demand side. What I mean by that is what's
the product – shape of the product portfolio, what we learned even from the cloud transition, which, as you know, Keith, was similar in the sense it was both a
knowledge-intensive and a capital-intensive transition. We needed to have the product portfolio where there was the right mix of, I'll call it, infrastructure meters as
well as SaaS applications. So that's the first thing that we are looking at. And how is that value landing with customers and what's the growth rate. So when I think
about what's happening with M365 Copilot as perhaps the best Office 365 or M365 suite we have had, the fact that we're getting recurring customers, so our
customers coming back buying more seats. So GitHub Copilot now being bigger than even GitHub when we bought it. What's happening in the contact center
with Dynamics. So I would say – and obviously, the Azure AI growth, that's the first place we look at. That then drives bulk of the CapEx spend, basically, that's
the demand signal because you got to remember, even in the capital spend, there is land and there is data center build, but 60-plus percent is the kit, that only
will be bought for inferencing and everything else if there is demand signal, right? So that's, I think, the key way to think about capital cycle even. The asset, as
Amy said, is a long-term asset, which is land and the data center, which, by the way, we don't even construct things fully, we can even have things which are
semi-constructed, we call [cold] (ph) shelves and so on. So we know how to manage our CapEx spend to build out a long-term asset and a lot of the hydration of
the kit happens when we have the demand signal. There is definitely spend for training. Even there, of course, we will only be scaling training as we see the
demand accrue in any given period in time. So I would say it's more important to manage, to capture the opportunity with the right product portfolio that's driving
value. And on that front, I feel good about the breadth of Microsoft offering, whether it's in consumer side, whether it's on commercial per seat side or on the
consumption meters, that's, I think, the fundamental driver.

And the next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.

### Exchange 003

**Mark Moerdler (Bernstein)**: Thank you very much. Thank you for taking the question. And congrats on a strong year. GenAI has been a bit of rollercoaster of a tech over the last year with
periods of acceleration, high expectations and the expectations drop as reality kicked in. With Azure growth we've seen this quarter and O365 Commercial, not
yet fully visible in numbers even though Amy, you gave us a lot of color on it. Two quick parts to the question. Satya, how should we think about what it's going to
take for GenAI to become more real across the industry and for it to become more visible within your SaaS offerings? And Amy, with Cloud, it took time for
margins to improve. It looks like with AI, it's happening quicker. Can you give us a sense of how you think about the margin impact near-term and long-term from
all the investment on AI? Thank you.

**Satya Nadella (CEO)**: Yes. Thanks again, Mark, for the question. So to me, look, at the end of the day, GenAI is just software. So it is really translating into fundamentally growth on
what has been our M365 SaaS offering with a newer offering that is the Copilot SaaS offering, which today is on a growth rate that's faster than any other
previous generation of software we launched as a suite in M365. That's, I think, the best way to describe it. I mean the numbers I think we shared even this
quarter are indicative of this, Mark. So if you look at it, we have both the landing of the seats itself quarter-over-quarter that is growing 60%, right? That's a pretty
good healthy sign. The most healthy sign for me is the fact that customers are coming back there. That is the same customers with whom we landed the seats
coming back and buying more seats. And then the number of customers with 10,000-plus seats doubled, right? It's 2x quarter-over-quarter. That, to me, is a
healthy SaaS core business. And on top of that, some of the things that Amy shared around Dynamic. That's another exciting place for us, which is one, we are
gaining share. We are – Dynamics with the GenAI built-in is sort of really biz app, it's probably the category that gets completely transformed with GenAI. Contact
centers being a great example. We ourselves are on course to save hundreds of millions of dollars in our own customer support and contact center operations. I
think we can drive that value to our customers. And then on the Azure side, you see the numbers very clearly. In fact, I think last quarter is when we started giving
you that. You saw an acceleration of that this quarter. One of the other pieces, Mark, is AI doesn't sit on its own, right? So it's just for – we have a concept of
design wins in Azure. So in fact, 50% of the folks who are using Azure AI are also using a data meter. That's very exciting to us because the most important thing
in Azure is to win workloads in the enterprise. And that is starting to happen. And these are generational things once they get going with you. So that's, I think,
how we think about it at least when I look at what's happening on our demand side.

### Exchange 004

**Mark Moerdler (Bernstein)**: Thank you.

**Brett Iversen (President)**: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question please.

The next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.

### Exchange 005

**Brent Thill (Jefferies)**: Thanks. Amy, the magnitude to beat this quarter was a little lower than we've seen in the past. Was there anything unusual on sales cycle that close rates that
you saw? Thanks.

### Exchange 006

**Brent Thill (Jefferies)**: Great. Thank you.

**Brett Iversen (President)**: Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question please.

The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.

### Exchange 007

**Karl Keirstead (UBS)**: Okay. Great. So maybe I'll direct this to Amy. Amy, I know when you set your Azure guidance, you're always looking to meet or beat the high-end. The 30% you
put up in the June quarter, amazing number given the scale of Azure, but it did come in at the low end of your range. And I'd just love for you to maybe elaborate
on the delta. I guess as I reflect on what you said in your comments. There's two things that I heard you say. One, it sounded like there's persistent capacity
constraints that you think might get alleviated in the second half? And then secondly, you mentioned perhaps some modest softness in Europe. I presume that's a
little bit more economic rather than Azure specific. Is that the right way to frame the performance in the quarter? Thank you.

### Exchange 008

**Karl Keirstead (UBS)**: Yes. Thank you, Amy.

**Brett Iversen (President)**: Thanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.

### Exchange 009

**Brad Zelnick (Deutsche Bank)**: Great. Thank you very much. Amy, with Azure demand, once again greater than available capacity, I appreciate the CapEx investments and the build-out and 
acceleration you expect in the back half. But as we think about Cloud capacity and AI services specifically, can you talk about both the near-term and long-term

strategy around the AI partnerships that you're signing with the likes of Oracle and Cohere, for example? Thank you.

**Satya Nadella (CEO)**: Yes. I mean, to me, it's no different than leases that we would have done in the past. These – you could even say sometimes buying from Oracle, maybe even
more efficient leases because they're even shorter date.

### Exchange 010

**Brad Zelnick (Deutsche Bank)**: Excellent. Thanks for the color.

**Brett Iversen (President)**: Thanks, Brad. Operator, next question please.

The next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.

### Exchange 011

**Mark Murphy (JPMorgan)**: Thank you very much. With a couple of quarters of Copilot for M365 availability under your belt now, how are you assessing the capability of Copilots to replicate
the productivity gains that they've created for developers, which seem to be very high and to do something similar for the broader population of knowledge
workers? For instance, you're mentioning the 10,000 feet deals, the repeat purchases, is it possible to eventually see Copilot penetration rate equally high in
office as they will be in GitHub?

**Satya Nadella (CEO)**: Yes, that's a great question. In fact, the GitHub design system and the GitHub Copilot workspace design system, which now, for example, you start with an issue,
you create a plan, from a plan, you create a spec, or you create a spec and from a spec, you create a plan and then you go operate across the full repo. That's
effectively the design system that is getting replicated inside of even the M365 Copilot. And you see this even now – for example, you get an email, you're in
sales, you want to respond to the customer. The data from the email is essentially context for a prompt but you expand by bringing in all of your CRM data, right?
So this customer email is in the context of some order, all of the CRM record gets completed in context and a reply gets generated with the CRM data. That's the
type of stuff that's already happening. Then you take something like Copilot Studio, you can start even grounding it in more data and then completing workflows.
So you could say if this email comes from this customer whose order date is got a particular issue with it. You can then go and escalate it to somebody else who
gets a notification in Teams. And those are the kinds of workflows that are getting built within IT or by end users themselves, what used to be line of business
applications to us are Copilot extensions going forward. So we think of this as really a new design system for knowledge and frontline work to drive productivity,
which would be very akin to what has happened in software engineering. So when you think about marketing or finance or sales or customer service, we will
effectively replicate what you just said, which is the type of productivity we've seen in developers, will come to all of these functions as they think about their work,
workflow and workout effect, all being driven by Copilots.

### Exchange 012

**Mark Murphy (JPMorgan)**: Thank you very much.

**Brett Iversen (President)**: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator
And the last question will come from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.

### Exchange 013

**Keith Bachman (BMO)**: Hi. Good evening, and thank you for the opportunity to ask the question. I actually wanted to veer towards gaming, if I could, for a second. Xbox content services
revenue grew 61%, 58 points held from Activision. So net is about 3 points of growth. How should investors think about the longer-term growth potential in this
area? You've made significant investments, including the Activision deal. But how should investors be thinking about the growth potential of the gaming? Or what
are the puts and takes to help make considerations here? Thank you.

**Satya Nadella (CEO)**: Yes. For us, our investment in gaming fundamentally was to have, I would say, the right portfolio of both what we love about gaming and always have loved about 
gaming, which is Xbox and the content for the console and expand from there so that we have content for everywhere people play games, starting with the PC. 
So when I think about the Activision portfolio, it comes with great assets for us to cover both the PC and the console. And then, of course, assets to cover mobile 
sockets, which we never have. So we feel that now we have both the content and the ability to access all the traditional high scale platforms where people play

games, which is the console, PC and mobile. But we're also excited about these new sockets, right? I mean the fact that even in this last quarter, we expanded X
Cloud to Amazon TV, I forget the name of what it's called. But that's the type of new access that really helps us a lot, get reach new gamers or the same gamer
everywhere they want to play. And that ultimately will show up in that software plus services and transaction revenue for us, which is really our long-term KPI, and
that's what we're building towards. And that was strategy behind Activision as an asset. Amy, if you want to add to it?
