And thank you everyone for joining today. In our fiscal Q1 2025, total revenue was a record $14.9 billion, up 25% year on year. And consolidated\nadjusted EBITDA was a record again, $10.1 billion, up 41% year on year. So let me first provide color on our semiconductor business. Q1 semiconductor revenue\nwas $8.2 billion, 11% year on year. Growth was driven by AI, as AI revenue of $4.1 billion was up 77% year on year. We repeat our guidance for AI revenue of\n$3.8 billion due to stronger shipments of networking solutions to hyperscalers on AI. Our hyperscale partners continue to invest aggressively in the next\ngeneration Frontier models, which do require high-performance accelerators as well as AI data centers with larger clusters. Consistent with this, we are stepping\nup our R&D investment on two fronts. One, we're pushing the envelope of technology in creating the next generation of accelerators. We're taping out the\nindustry's first two-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D, as we drive towards a 10,000 teraflops XPU. Secondly, we have a view towards scaling clusters of\n500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers. We have doubled the radix capacity of this of the existing Tomahawk 5. And beyond this, to enable AI clusters to\nscale up on Ethernet towards one million XPUs. We have taped out our next-generation 100 terabit Tomahawk 6 switch running 200G SerDes and 1.6 terabit\nbandwidth. We will be delivering samples to customers within the next few months. These R&D investments are very aligned with the roadmap of our three\nhyperscale customers as they each race towards one million XPU clusters by the end of 2027. And, accordingly, we do reaffirm what we said last quarter, that we\nexpect these three hyperscale customers will generate a serviceable addressable market or SAM in the range of $60 to $90 billion in fiscal 2027. Beyond these\nthree customers, we had also mentioned previously that we are deeply engaged with two other hyperscalers in enabling them to create their own customized AI\naccelerator. We are on track to tape out their XPUs this year. In the process of working with the hyperscalers, it has become very clear that while they are\nexcellent in software, Broadcom is the best in hardware. Working together is what optimizes large language models. It is therefore no surprise to us since our last\nearnings call, the two additional hyperscalers have selected Broadcom to develop custom accelerators to train their next-generation Frontier models. So even as\nwe have three hyperscale customers, we are shipping XPUs in volume today. There are now four more who are deeply engaged with us to create their own\naccelerators. And to be clear, of course, these four are not included in our estimated SAM of $60 billion to $90 billion in 2027. So we do see an exciting trend\nhere. New Frontier models and techniques put unexpected pressures on AI systems. It's difficult to serve all classes of models with a single system design point.\nAnd therefore, it is hard to imagine that a general-purpose accelerator can be configured and optimized across multiple Frontier models. And as I mentioned\nbefore, the trend towards XPUs is a multiyear journey. So coming back to 2025, we see a steady ramp in deployment of all our XPUs and networking products.\nSo Q1 AI revenue was $4.1 billion, and we expect Q2 AI revenue to grow to $4.4 billion, which is up 44% year on year. Turning to non-AI semiconductors,\nrevenue of $4.1 billion was down 9% sequentially on a seasonal decline in wireless. In aggregate, during Q1, the recovery in non-AI semiconductors continues to\nbe slow. Broadband, which bottomed in Q4 2024, showed a double-digit sequential recovery in Q1 and is expected to be up similarly in Q2 as service providers\nand telcos step up spending. Server storage was down single digits sequentially in Q1 but is expected to be up high single digits sequentially in Q2. Meanwhile,\nenterprise networking continues to remain flattish in the first half of fiscal 2025 as customers continue to work through channel inventory. Wireless was down\nsequentially due to a seasonal decline. It remained flat year on year. In Q2, wireless is expected to be the same, flat again year on year. Resales in industrial\nwere down double digits in Q1 and are expected to be down in Q2. So reflecting the foregoing puts and takes, we expect non-AI semiconductor revenue in Q2 to\nbe flattish sequentially even though we are seeing bookings continue to grow year on year. In summary, for Q2, we expect total semiconductor revenue to grow\n2% sequentially and up 17% year on year to $8.4 billion. Turning now to infrastructure software. Q1 infrastructure software revenue of $6.7 billion was up 47%\nyear on year and up 15% sequentially, exaggerated though by deals which slipped from Q4 to Q1. Now this is the first quarter Q1 2025 where the year on year\ncomparables include VMware in both quarters. We're seeing significant growth in the software segment for two reasons. One, we're converting from a footprint of\nlargely perpetual licenses to one of full subscription. And as of today, we are over 60% done. Two, these perpetual licenses were only largely for virtualization,\notherwise called vSphere. We are upselling customers to a full stack VCF, which enables the entire data center to be virtualized and enables customers to create\ntheir own private cloud environment on-prem. And as of the end of Q1, approximately 70% of our largest 10,000 customers have adopted VCF. As these\ncustomers consume VCF, we do see a further opportunity for future growth. As large enterprises adopt AI, they have to run their AI workloads on their on-prem\ndata centers, which will include both GPU servers as well as traditional CPUs. And just as VCF virtualizes these traditional data centers using CPUs, VCM will\nalso virtualize GPUs on a common platform and then enable enterprises to import AI models to run their own data on-prem. This platform, which virtualizes the\nGPU, is called the VMware Private AI Foundation. And as of today, in collaboration with NVIDIA, we have 39 enterprise customers for the VMware Private AI\nFoundation. Customer demand has been driven by our open ecosystem, superior load balancing, and automation capabilities, which allow them to intelligently\npool and run workloads across both GPU and CPU infrastructure, leading to very reduced costs. Moving on to Q2 outlook for software, we expect revenue of $6.5\nbillion, up 23% year on year. So in total, we're guiding Q2 consolidated revenue to be approximately $14.9 billion, up 19% year on year. And we expect this will\ndrive Q2 adjusted EBITDA to approximately 66% of revenue. With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.", "char_count": 6715, "word_count": 1125, "token_count": 1532, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}
{"doc_id": "AVGO_2025_Q1", "ticker": "AVGO", "year": 2025, "quarter": 1, "filing_date": "2025-03-01", "phase": "prepared_remarks", "speaker_name": "Kirsten Spears", "speaker_role": "CFO", "speaker_firm": null, "utterance_id": "u_0002", "utterance_type": "statement", "text": "Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q1 financial performance. From a year on year comparable basis, keep in mind that Q1 of fiscal\n2024 was a 14-week quarter and Q1 of fiscal 2025 is a 13-week quarter. Consolidated revenue was $14.9 billion for the quarter, up 25% from a year ago. Gross\nmargin was 79.1% of revenue in the quarter, better than we originally guided on higher infrastructure software revenue and more favorable semiconductor\nrevenue mix. Consolidated operating expenses were $2 billion, of which $1.4 billion was for R&D. Q1 operating income of $9.8 billion was up 44% from a year\nago with operating margin at 66% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was a record $10.1 billion or 68% of revenue, above our guidance of 66%. This figure excludes\n$142 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our two segments. Starting with semiconductors. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was\n$8.2 billion and represented 55% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 11% year on year. Gross margin for our semiconductor solutions segment was\napproximately 68%, up 70 basis points year on year driven by revenue mix. Operating expenses increased 3% year on year to $890 million on increased\ninvestment in R&D for leading-edge AI semiconductors, resulting in semiconductor operating margin of 57%. Now moving on to infrastructure software. Revenue\nfor infrastructure software of $6.7 billion was 45% and up 47% year on year based primarily on increased revenue from VMware. Gross margin for infrastructure\nsoftware was 92.5% in the quarter compared to 88% a year ago. Operating expenses were approximately $1.1 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure\nsoftware operating margin of 76%. This compares to operating margin of 59% a year ago. This year on year improvement reflects our disciplined integration of\nVMware and sharp focus on deploying our VCF strategy. Moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $6 billion and represented 40% of revenue.\nFree cash flow as a percentage of revenue continues to be impacted by cash interest expense from debt related to the VMware acquisition and cash taxes due to\nthe mix of US taxable income, the continued delay in the reenactment of section 174, and the impact of Corporate AMT. We spent $100 million on capital\nexpenditures. Day sales outstanding were 30 days in the first quarter compared to 41 days a year ago. We ended the first quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, up\n8% sequentially, to support revenue in future quarters. Our days of inventory on hand were 65 days in Q1 as we continue to remain disciplined on how we\nmanage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the first quarter with $9.3 billion of cash and $68.8 billion of gross principal debt. During the quarter, we\nrepaid $495 million of fixed-rate debt and $7.6 billion of floating-rate debt with new senior notes, commercial paper, and cash on hand, reducing debt by a net\n$1.1 billion. Following these actions, the weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $58.8 billion in fixed-rate debt is 3.8% and 7.3 years\nrespectively. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $6 billion in floating-rate debt is 5.4% and 3.8 years respectively. And our $4 billion\nin commercial paper is at an average rate of 4.6%. Turning to capital allocation. In Q1, we paid stockholders $2.8 billion of cash dividends based on a quarterly\ncommon stock cash dividend of $59 per share. We spent $2 billion to repurchase 8.7 million AVGO shares from employees as those shares vested or withholding\ntaxes. In Q2, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be approximately 4.95 billion shares. Now moving on to guidance. Our guidance for Q2 is for\nconsolidated revenue of $14.9 billion with semiconductor revenue of approximately $8.4 billion, up 17% year on year. We expect Q2 AI revenue of $4.4 billion, up\n44% year on year. For non-AI semiconductors, we expect Q2 revenue of $4 billion. We expect Q2 infrastructure software revenue of approximately $6.5 billion,\nup 23% year on year. We expect Q2 adjusted EBITDA to be about 66%. For modeling purposes, we expect Q2 consolidated gross margin to be down\napproximately 20 basis points sequentially on the revenue mix of infrastructure software. As Hock discussed earlier, we are increasing our R&D investment in\nleading-edge AI in Q2 and accordingly, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 66%. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate for Q2 and fiscal year 2025 to\nbe approximately 14%. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we will now open for questions.\nOperator\nThank you.

And thanks for your kind wishes. But what we're seeing is and by the way, these four are not customers as we define it. As\nI've always said, you know, in developing and creating XPUs, you know, we are not really the creator of those XPUs, to be honest. We enable each of those\nhyperscalers partners we engage with to create that chip and to basically, to create that compute system. Call it that way. And it comprises the model, the\nsoftware model, working closely with the compute engine, the XPU, and the networking that ties together the clusters of those multiple XPUs as a whole to train\nthose large Frontier models. And so you know, and the fact that we create the hardware it still has to work with the software models and the algorithms of those\npartners of ours before it becomes fully deployable and scale, which is why we define customers in this case as those where we know they have deployed at\nscale and we'll receive the production volume to enable it. Right. For that, we only have just the three. The four are, I call it partners, who are trying to create the\nsame thing as the first three and to run their own Frontier models, each of it on there to train their own Frontier models. And as I also said, it doesn't happen\novernight. To do the first chip, could take would take typically a year and a half. And that's very accelerated and which we could accelerate given that we\nessentially have a framework and a methodology that works right now. It works for the three customers. No reason for it to not work for the four. Still need those\nfour partners to create and to develop a software which we don't do to make it work, and to answer your question, there's no reason why these four guys would\nnot create a demand in the range of what we're seeing with the first three guys.

I mean, there's the threat, the noise of tariffs, especially on chips, that has a material lines in it. Nor\ndo we know how it will be structured. So we don't know. But we do experience and we are leaving it now. Is the disruption on that is paused in a positive way. I\nshould add a very positive disruption in semiconductors, on a generative AI. Generative AI for sure. And we I said that before, so at the risk of repeating, you\nknow, but it's we feel it more than ever. Is really accelerating the development of semiconductor technology. Both process and packaging as well as design.\nTowards higher and higher performance accelerators and networking functionality. We've seen that innovation that those upgrades occur on a every month. As\nwe face new interesting challenges. And when particularly with XPUs. We're trying within as to optimize to Frontier models of our partners, our customers, as well\nas our hyperscale partners. And we it's a lot of I mean, it's a it's a privilege almost for us to be to participate in it and try to optimize. And by optimize, I mean, you\nlook at an accelerator. You can look at it for simple terms, high level, to to perform, to want to maybe mention not just on one single mentoring, which is compute\ncapacity, how many teraflops? It's more than that. It's also tied to the fact that this is a distributed computing problem. It's not just the sing the compute capacity of\na single XPU or GPU. It's also the network bandwidth. It ties itself to the next adjacent XPU or GPU. So that has an impact. So you're doing that. You'll have the\nbalance with that. Then you decide, are you doing training or you're doing prefilling? Post training. Fine tuning. And again then comes how much memory do you\nbalance against that? And with it, how much latency you can afford, which is memory bandwidth. So you will look at the at least four variables, maybe even five. If\nyou're in clone in memory bandwidth. Not just memory capacity, when you go straight to inference. So we we have all these variables to play with and we try to\noptimize it. So all this is very, very I mean, it's a great experience for our engineers to push their envelope on how to create all those chips and so that's the\nbiggest disruption we see right now. From sheer trying to create and push the envelope on generative AI. Trying to create the best hardware infrastructure to run\nit. Beyond that, yeah, there are there are other things too that come into play because with AI, as I indicated, just not just drive hardware for enterprises, it drives\nthe way the architect their data centers. You know, data requirement they keep keeping data private on on under control becomes important. So suddenly, the\npush of what loads towards public cloud. May take a little pause as large enterprises particularly, have to they have to take direct device that you want to run AI\nworkloads. You're probably thinking very hard about running them on-prem. And suddenly, push yourself to a saying, got to upgrade your own data centers. To\ndo you know, and manage the your own data to run it on-prem. And that's also pushing a trend that with we have been seeing now over the past twelve months.\nHence, my comments on VMware Private AI Foundation. This is to especially enterprises pushing direction at quickly recognizing that how where do they run\ntheir AI workloads. So those are trends we see today and a lot of it coming out of AI, a lot of it coming out of sensitive rules on sovereignty, in cloud and in data.\nOn as far as you're mentioning tariffs is concerned, I think that's too early for us to figure out where to online.

So that takes a long lead time because from taping out getting in the product, it takes a year. Easily from the product in the\nhands. Of our partner to when it goes into scale production, it will take six months to a year. It's our experience that we've seen. Number one and number two. I\nmean, producing and deploying five thousand SKUs that's that's a joke. That's not real production in my in our view.

So we limit ourselves to how many customers or how many potential customers that exist out there,\nRoss. And we tend to be very selective who we pick. The beginning. So when we say design win, it really is at scale. It's not something that starts in six months\nand die or a year and die again. Basically, it's a selection of custom.
