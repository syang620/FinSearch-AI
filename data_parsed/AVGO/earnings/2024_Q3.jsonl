In our fiscal Q3 2024, consolidated net revenue of $13.1 billion was up 47% year-on-year, and\noperating profit was up 44% year-on-year. These strong results reflected three key factors: one, AI revenue continues to grow and grow strongly; two, VMware\nbookings continue to accelerate; and three, non-AI semiconductor revenue has stabilized. Before I give you more color on our two reporting segments, let me\ngive you a quick update on guidance. Now we started the year providing annual guidance with quarterly updates as we run the process of integrating VMware.\nThings are now much more stable and we are in the first -- sorry, and we're in the final quarter of 2024. So instead of giving you annual guidance, we now revert\nto providing the quarterly guidance for Q4. Starting with software. In Q3, infrastructure software segment revenue of $5.8 billion was up 200% year-on-year driven\nby $3.8 billion in revenue contribution from VMware. The transformation of the business model of VMware continues to progress very well. In fact, last week, we\nheld a well-attended VMware Explore Conference in Las Vegas, our first as a combined company. This event was all about promoting VMware Cloud Foundation,\nor VCF, which is the full software stack that virtualizes an entire data center and creates a private cloud environment on-prem for enterprises. The success of this\nstrategy is reflected in our performance in fiscal Q3. We booked more than 15 million CPU costs of VCF, representing over 80% of the total VMware products we\nbooked during the quarter. And this translates into an annualized booking value, or ABV as I had described before, of $2.5 billion during Q3, up 32% from the\npreceding quarter. Meanwhile, we continue to drive down costs in VMware. We brought VMware spending down to $1.3 million in Q3 from $1.6 million in Q2. And\nwhen we acquired VMware, our target was to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $8.5 billion within three years of the acquisition. We are well on the path to achieving or\neven exceeding this EBITDA goal in the next fiscal '25. Now turning to semiconductors. In networking, Q3 revenue of $4 billion grew 43% year-on-year,\nrepresenting 55% of semiconductor revenue. This was again driven by strong demand from hyperscalers for both AI networking and on custom AI accelerators.\nAs you know, our hyperscale customers continue to scale up and scale out their AI clusters. Custom AI accelerators grew 3.5 times year-on-year. In the fabric,\nEthernet switching, driven by Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI grew over 4 times year-on-year, while our optical lasers and PIN diodes used in optical interconnects\ngrew three-fold. Meanwhile, PCI Express switches more than doubled, and we're shipping in volume our industry-leading 5 nanometer, 400 gigabit per second\nNICs and 800 gigabit per second DSPs. So now let me give you more color on our networking products, which are not used in AI. As we had indicated last\nquarter, we believe we did bottom in Q2. And in Q3, non-AI networking was up actually 17% sequentially, even as it was down 41% year-on-year. We expect this\nlevel of revenue to sustain in Q4 and the year-on-year decline to moderate to 30%. So in adding the strength, we continue to see in AI, we expect total networking\nrevenue to grow over 40% year-on-year in Q4. Across enterprise infrastructure, we see the same trend of recovery in server storage. Our Q3 server storage\nconnectivity revenue was $861 million, up 5% sequentially and down 25% year-on-year. In Q4, we expect server storage revenue to grow mid to high-single digit\npercent sequentially, even as revenue is expected to be down high-single digit percent year-on-year. Moving on to wireless. Q3 wireless revenue of $1.7 billion\ngrew 1% year-on-year, representing 23% of semiconductor revenue. And in Q4, reflecting the launch of next-generation devices and our North American\ncustomers, we expect wireless revenue to actually grow over 20% sequentially even as it will be relatively flat year-on-year. On to broadband, Q3 revenue\ndeclined 49% year-on-year to $557 million, represented 8% of semiconductor revenue. Broadband remains weak on a continued pause in telco and service\nprovider spending. And in Q4, we expect broadband to continue to be down over 40% year-on-year, but we do expect that recovery to begin in '25. Finally, Q3\nindustrial resales of $164 million declined 31% year-on-year. We believe we are approaching bottom in Q3 as Q4 resales are expected to recover sequentially.\nYear-on-year, Q4 industrial resales will still be down approximately 20%. In summary, here are the trends we are seeing in semiconductors. In aggregate, we\nhave reached bottom in our non-AI markets and we're expecting a recovery in Q4. AI demand remains strong and we expect, in Q4, AI revenue to grow\nsequentially 10% to over $3.5 billion. This will translate to AI revenue of $12 billion for fiscal '24, up from our prior guidance of over $11 billion. Putting it all\ntogether with software, here's our forecast for Q4. We expect Q4 semiconductor revenue of approximately $8 billion, up 9% year-on-year. For infrastructure\nsoftware, we expect revenue to be about $6 billion. So we are guiding Q4 consolidated revenue to be approximately $14 billion, which is up 51% year-on-year.\nWe also expect this will drive Q4 consolidated adjusted EBITDA to approximate -- to achieve approximately 64% of revenue. This Q4 guidance would imply we\nare raising the outlook for our fiscal 2024 revenue to $51.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA for the year to 61.5%. And with that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.", "char_count": 5643, "word_count": 931, "token_count": 1328, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "AVGO_TRANSCRIPT_2024_Q3_u_0002", "company": "AVGO", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2024, "period": "2024-Q3", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/AVGO/AVGO_FY2024_Q3.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}
{"doc_id": "AVGO_TRANSCRIPT_2024_Q3", "ticker": "AVGO", "quarter": "Q3", "filing_date": "2024-09-01", "phase": "prepared_remarks", "speaker_name": "Kirsten Spears", "speaker_role": "CFO", "speaker_firm": null, "utterance_id": "u_0003", "utterance_type": "statement", "text": "Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q3 financial performance. Consolidated revenue was $13.1 billion for the quarter, up 47% from a \nyear ago. Excluding the contribution from VMware, Q3 revenue increased 4% year-on-year. Gross margins were 77.4% of revenue in the quarter. R&D was $1.5 \nbillion and consolidated operating expenses were $2.2 billion, up year-on-year primarily due to the consolidation of VMware. Q3 operating income was $7.9 billion \nand was up 44% from a year ago, with operating margin at 61% of revenue. Excluding transition costs, operating profit of $8 billion was up 45% from a year ago \nwith operating margin of 62% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $8.2 billion or 63% of revenue. This figure excludes $149 million of depreciation. Now a review of \nthe P&L for our two segments, starting with semis. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $7.3 billion and represented 56% of total revenue in\n\nthe quarter, this was up 5% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 68%, down 270 basis points year-on-year,\ndriven primarily by a higher mix of custom AI accelerators. Operating expenses increased 11% year-on-year to $881 million on increased investment in R&D,\nresulting in semiconductor operating margins of 56%. Now moving on to infrastructure software. Revenue for infrastructure software was $5.8 billion, up 200%\nyear-on-year primarily due to the contribution of VMware and represented 44% of revenue. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 90% in the quarter,\nand operating expenses were $1.3 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software operating margin of 67%. Excluding transition costs, operating margin\nwas 69%. Moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.8 billion and represented 37% of revenues. Excluding cash used for restructuring and\nintegration of $529 million, free cash flows of $5.3 billion were up 14% year-on-year and represented 41% of revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue\nhas declined from the same quarter a year ago due to higher cash interest expense from debt related to the VMware acquisition and higher cash taxes due to a\nhigher mix of U.S. income and the continued delay in the reenactment of Section 174. We spent $172 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding\nwere 32 days in the quarter, in line with the year ago. We ended the third quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, up 3% sequentially. Note that we continue to\nremain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the third quarter with $10 billion of cash and $72.3 billion of gross principal\ndebt. During the quarter, we replaced $5 billion of floating rate notes with new fixed senior notes. We used the proceeds from the completed sale of VMware's\nEnd-User Computing business to KKR, and cash on hand to reduce floating rate debt by an additional $4.2 billion. Following these actions, the weighted average\ncoupon rate and years to maturity of our $53 billion in fixed rate debt is 3.6% and 7.7 years, respectively. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity\nof our $19 billion in floating rate debt is 6.7% and 3.1 years, respectively. We expect to repay approximately $1.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes due in Q4.\nTurning to capital allocation. In Q3, we paid stockholders $2.5 billion of cash dividends, which based on a split adjusted quarterly common stock count,\nrepresented a cash dividend of $0.525 per share. For Q4, we are rounding up the quarterly cash dividend to $0.53 per share. In Q3, the split adjusted non-GAAP\ndiluted share count was 4.92 billion, in line with expectations. We paid $1.4 billion of withholding taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the\nelimination of 8.4 million AVGO shares. In Q4, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be approximately 4.91 billion shares. Now on to guidance. Our\nguidance for Q4 is for consolidated revenue of $14 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 64%. For modeling purposes, we expect consolidated gross\nmargins to be down approximately 100 basis points sequentially on the higher revenue mix of semiconductors and product mix within semiconductors. GAAP net\nincome and cash flows in Q4 are impacted by higher taxes, restructuring, and integration related cash costs due to the VMware acquisition. As Hock just\ndiscussed, we are resuming quarterly revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for fiscal 2025 as fiscal year '24 has been a transition and integration year\nfollowing the VMware deal close. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.\nOperator\nThank you.

But we're seeing largely on enterprise, enterprise data center, enterprise IT spending, we've passed the bottom. And we are, in Q3 was, in fact,\nsequentially, a recovery from the bottom of, we believe Q2 or Q1 this fiscal year. And we'll see Q4 continuing that recovery and obviously, in our view, into '25 in\nterms of the cycle. Broadband, we are not seeing it yet in terms of the bottom, but we see that as close to bottom in the sense that here again, bookings are up\nfrom where it used to be. And so we are very, very clear in our thinking that broadly, we have, as a whole, non-AI semiconductors, we've gone through the down\ncycle is on an uptick. And like, all previous cycles, my sense, Stacy, is we will get us back to the level we used to be. There's no reason at all why it doesn't and\ngiven the rate of bookings, it won\u2019t go. I dare say even put a thought in your mind that as AI permeates enterprises all across and digital natives, you need to\nupgrade servers. You need to upgrade storage. You need to upgrade networking, connectivity across the entire ecosystem. And if anything else, we are headed\n-- we could be headed for up cycle. Timing precisely when, we\u2019re not sure. But an up cycle, that could even meet or even surpass what our previous up cycles\nwould be, simply because the amount of bandwidth you need, the amount of compete -- to manage store, manage all these workloads that come out of AI would\njust put -- need to refresh and upgrade hardware. So that\u2019s my $0.02 worth on where we\u2019re headed from this down cycle. So my belief in \u201824 was the lowest point\nfor the uptick. As part of the reasons we are stating it very clearly here. On the software side, your question, no, I think we have reached a level of stability that\nputs and takes Brocade, one of those goes up and down very volatile, and that\u2019s largely. But on the non-Vmware revenue, on software revenue, I think we\u2019ve\nreached a level of very clear stability. And what we are looking towards more is how Vmware picks up over the next several a year and 1.5 years.", "char_count": 3018, "word_count": 562, "token_count": 720, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "AVGO_TRANSCRIPT_2024_Q3_u_0012", "company": "AVGO", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2024, "period": "2024-Q3", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/AVGO/AVGO_FY2024_Q3.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

In terms of GPU growth, you should ask the guys who does merchant GPU\nor GPU which is obviously, NVIDIA and ASD. And I don't see -- I don't play in the enterprise market at all. See, that's part of the market I don't see. Having said\nthat, they do both play somewhat in the hyperscalers, where I'm totally focused on doing.

I\u2019m not in a path of, in the meantime, a\ndifferent trajectory of enabling enterprises to do AI on their own workloads. That\u2019s more the merchant guys.
