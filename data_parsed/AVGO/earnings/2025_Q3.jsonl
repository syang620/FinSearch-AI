And thank you everyone for joining us today. In our fiscal Q3 2025, total revenue was a record $16 billion, up 22% year on year. Now revenue\ngrowth was driven by better than expected strength in AI semiconductors, and our continued growth in VMware. Q3 consolidated adjusted EBITDA was a record\n$10.7 billion, up 30% year on year. Now, looking beyond what we are just reporting this quarter, with robust demand from AI bookings, were extremely strong.\nAnd our current consolidated backlog for the company hit a record of $110 billion. Q3 semiconductor revenue was $9.2 billion as year on year growth accelerated\nto 26% year on year. And this accelerated growth was driven by AI Semiconductor revenue of $5.2 billion, which was up 63% year on year and extend the\ntrajectory of robust growth to 10 consecutive quarters. Now let me give you more color on our XPU business, which accelerated to 65% of our AI revenue this\nquarter. Demand for custom AI accelerators from our three customers continued to grow as each of them journeys at their own pace towards compute\nself-sufficiency. And progressively, we continue to gain share with these customers. Now, further to these three customers, as we have previously mentioned, we\nhave been working with other prospects on their own AI accelerators. Last quarter, one of these prospects released production orders to Broadcom. And we have\naccordingly characterized them as a qualified customer for XPUs. And in fact, has secured over $10 billion of orders of AI regs based on our XPUs. And reflecting\nthis, we now expect the outlook for fiscal 2026 AI revenue to improve significantly from what we had indicated last quarter. Turning to AI networking. Demand\ncontinued to be strong. Because networking is becoming critical as LLMs continue to evolve in intelligence and compute classes have to grow bigger. The\nnetwork is the computer. And our customers are facing challenges as they scale to clusters beyond 100,000 compute nodes. For instance, scale up which we all\nknow about, is a difficult challenge. When you are trying to create substantial bandwidth to share memory across multiple GPUs or XPUs with the direct Today's\nAI rank scales up a mere 72 GPUs at 28.8 terabit per second bandwidth using a proprietary NVLink. On the other hand, earlier this year, we have launched\nTomahawk five We've opened AI we've opened Ethernet. Sorry. Which can scale up 512 compute nodes for customers using XPUs. Moving on to scaling out\nacross regs. Today, the current architecture using 51.2 terabit per second requires three tiers of networking switches. In June, we launched Tomahawk six and\nour Ethernet based 102 terabit per second switch which flattens the network. To two tiers. Resulting in lower latency much less power. And when you scale to\nclusters beyond single data center footprint, You now need to scale computing across data centers. And over the past two years, we have deployed our Jericho\nthree Ethernet router with hyperscale customers to just do this. And today, we have launched our next generation Jericho four. Ethernet fabric router with 51.2\nterabit per second deep buffering intelligence intelligent congestion control, to handle classes beyond 200,000 compute nodes crossing multiple data centers. We\nknow the biggest challenge to deploying larger clusters of compute for generative AI will be in networking. And for the past twenty years, Broadcom has\ndeveloped for Ethernet, networking is entirely applicable to the challenges of scale up, scale out, and scale across in generative AI. And turning to our forecast as\nI mentioned earlier, we continue to make steady progress in growing our AI revenue. For Q4, 2025, we forecast AI semiconductor revenue to be approximately\n$6.2 billion, up 66% year on year. Now, turning to non AI semiconductors. Demand continues to be slow to recover. In Q3 revenue of $4 billion was flat\nsequentially. While broadband showed strong sequential growth, Enterprise networking and service storage were down sequentially. Wireless and industrial were\nflat quarter on quarter as we expect. In contrast, in Q4, driven by seasonality, we forecast non AI semiconductor revenue to grow low double digits sequentially to\napproximately $4.6 billion. Broadband, server storage and wireless are expected to improve. While enterprise networking remains down quarter on quarter. Now\nlet me talk about our infrastructure software segment. Q3 Infrastructure Software revenue of $6.8 billion was 17% year on year. Above our outlook of $6.7 billion\nas bookings continue to be strong during the quarter. We booked in fact total contract value over $8.4 billion during Q3. But here's one I'm most excited about.\nAfter two years of engineering development by over 5,000 developers. We deliver on a promise. When we acquired VMware. We release VMware Cloud\nFoundation version nine dot zero a fully integrated cloud platform which can be deployed by enterprise customers on prem or carry to the cloud. It enables\nenterprises to run any application workload including AI workloads, on virtual machines and on modern containers. These provides the real alternative to public\nclub. In Q4, we expect Infrastructure and Software revenue to be approximately $6.7 billion, up 15% year on year. And in summary, continued strength in AI and\nVMware would drive our guidance for Q4 consolidated revenue to approximately $17.4 billion, up 24% year on year. And we expect Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be\n67% of revenue. And with that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.", "char_count": 5541, "word_count": 905, "token_count": 1193, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "AVGO_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q3_u_0001", "company": "AVGO", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2025, "period": "2025-Q3", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/AVGO/AVGO_FY2025_Q3.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

Let me now provide additional detail on our Q3 financial performance. Consolidated revenue was a record $16 billion for the quarter, up 22% \nfrom a year ago. Gross margin was 78.4% of revenue in the quarter, better than we originally guided on higher software revenues and product mix within \nsemiconductors. Consolidated operating expenses were $2 billion of which $1.5 billion was research and development. Q3 operating income was a record $10.5 \nbillion, up 32% from a year ago. On a sequential basis, even as gross margin was down 100 basis points on revenue mix, operating margin increased 20 basis \npoints sequentially to 65.5% on operating leverage. Adjusted EBITDA of $10.7 billion or 67% of revenue was above our guidance of 66%. This figure excludes a \n$142 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P and L for our two segments. Starting with semiconductors. Revenue for our Semiconductor Solutions segment \nwas $9.2 billion with growth accelerating to 26% year on year driven by AI. Semiconductor revenue represented 57% of total revenue in the quarter. Gross margin \nfor our Semiconductor Solutions segment was approximately 67% down 30 basis points year on year on product mix. Operating expenses increased 9% year on \nyear to $951 million on increased investment in R and D for leading edge AI semiconductors. Semiconductor operating margin of 57% was up 130 basis points \nyear on year and flat sequentially. Now moving on to infrastructure software. Revenue for infrastructure software of $6.8 billion was up 17% year on year and\n\nrepresented 43% of revenue. Gross margin for infrastructure software 93% in the quarter compared to 90% a year ago. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion in\nthe quarter, resulting in infrastructure software operating margin of approximately 77%. This compares to operating margin of 67% a year ago reflecting the\ncompletion of the integration of VMware. Moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $7 billion and represented 44% of revenue. We spent $142\nmillion on capital expenditures. Day sales outstanding were thirty seven days in the third quarter compared to thirty two days a year ago. We ended the third\nquarter with inventory of $2.2 billion up 8% sequentially in anticipation of revenue growth next quarter. Our days of inventory on hand were sixty six days in Q3,\ncompared to sixty nine days in Q2 as we continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the third quarter with\n$10.7 billion of cash and $66.3 billion of gross principal debt. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $65.8 billion in fixed rate debt is\n3.9% and 6.9 years, respectively. The weighted average interest rate and years to maturity of our $500 million at floating rate debt is 4.7% and 0.2 years,\nrespectively. Turning to capital allocation. Q3, we paid stockholders $2.8 billion of cash dividends, based on a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.59 per\nshare. We expect the non GAAP diluted share count to be In Q4, approximately 4.97 billion shares, excluding the potential impact of any share repurchases. Now\nmoving to guidance. Our guidance for Q4 is for consolidated revenue of $17.4 billion up 24% year on year. We forecast semiconductor revenue of approximately\n$10.7 billion up 30% year on year. Within this, we expect Q4 AI semiconductor revenue of $6.2 billion up 66% year on year. We expect infrastructure software\nrevenue of approximately $6.7 billion up 15% year on year. For your modeling purposes, we expect Q4 consolidated gross margin to be down approximately 70\nbasis points sequentially primarily reflecting a higher mix of XPUs and also wireless revenue. As a reminder, consolidated gross margins through the year will be\nimpacted by the revenue mix of infrastructure software and product mix within semiconductors. We expect Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be 67%. We expect the non\nGAAP tax rate for Q4 and fiscal year 2025 to remain at 14%.

Good afternoon. Congratulations on a well executed quarter and strong free cash flow. Know everybody's gonna ask a lot of questions on AI, Hock.

Good news, is that the negative year over year trends have been improving to the year, in fact, think you\nguys are gonna be positive year over year in the fourth quarter. You've characterized it as relatively close to the cyclical bottom, relatively slow to recover.\nHowever, we have seen some green shoots of positivity. Right? Broadband server storage, enterprise networking. You're still driving the DOCSIS four upgrade in\nbroadband, cable, You've got next gen PON upgrades in China and The US in front of you. Enterprise spending on network upgrades is accelerating. So near\nterm, from the cyclical bottom, how should we think about the magnitude of the cyclical upturn?

And the and the big issue is the puts and takes. And the puts and takes\nand the bottom line to all this is other than seasonality that we perceive if you look at it short term, we've all looking year on year, but looking sequentially. We see\nin things like wireless and we even start to see some seasonality in server storage these days. We don't kind of all washes out so far. The only consistent trend\nwe've seen over the last three quarters that is moving up strongly is broadband. And nothing else if you look at it from a cyclical point of view, seems to be able to\nsustain an uptrend so far. I don't think it's getting but as a whole, they are not getting worse as you pointed out, Harlan. But they are not showing a v shaped\nrecovery as a whole.

But then it was the business that was most impacted in the in the sharp downturn of '24 and early twenty five. So\nagain, one takes that with a grain of salt. But best answer to you for you is non non AI semiconductor is kind of slow to recover as I said. And Q4 year on year is\nup maybe low single digits. Is the best way to to describe it at this point.

My question is on know, if you could help us quantify what is the new fiscal twenty\nsix AI guidance. Because I think the last call you mentioned '26 could grow at the 60% growth rate. So what is the updated number? Is it, you know, 60% plus the\nthe $10 billion that you mentioned? And sort of related to that, do you expect the custom versus networking mix to stay broadly what it has been this past year or\nor evolve more towards customs? So any quantification on this, you know, networking versus custom mix would be very helpful. Fiscal twenty six. Okay. Let's\nanswer the first part first. If I could be so bold as to suggest to you when I last quarter when I said, hey, the trend of growth of '26 will mirror that of '25. Which is\n50, 60%. Year on year. That's really all I say. I didn't quote a ban. Of course, it comes out 50, percent because that's what '25 is. All I'm saying you want to put\nanother way of it, looking at what I'm saying, which is perhaps more accurate, we're seeing the growth rate accelerate. As opposed to just remain steady at that\n50, 60% We are expecting and seeing 2026 to accelerate more than the growth rate we see in '25. And I know you love me to throw in a number at you, but you\nknow what? We're not supposed to be giving you a forecast for '26, but best way to describe it, it will be fairly material improvement. And the networking versus\ncustom? Ah, good point. Thanks for reminding me. As we see it and a big part of this driver of growth will be experience. And as a to and the reason of repeating\nwhat I said in my remarks, comes from the fact that we are continue to gain share at our three original customers They have to they're on their journey, and each\npassing generation they go more to XPUs. So we are gaining share from this three. We now have the benefit of an additional four four significant customer. I\nwould just say fourth and very significant customer. And that combination will mean more XPUs. And as I said, as the ratio as the as we create more and more\nexperience among four guys, the networking we get the networking with these four guys, but now the mix of networking from outside these four guys will now be a\nsmaller be diluted, be a smaller share. So I expect actually networking percentage of the pool to be a declining percentage. Going into twenty six.\nOperator\nThank you, And one moment for our next question.

To answer your first part of the question, yeah, pretty much virtually way over 90% is is bought VCF.

Here comes the other part of our work, which is to\ntake this 10,000 customers or big chunk of them who have taken who have bought the vision of a private cloud on prem and working with them to enable them to\ndeploy and operate it successfully on their infrastructure on prem. That's the net the hard work over the next two years that we see happening. And as we do it,\nwe see expansion across their foot IT footprint on VCF private cloud. Running on the dataset in within their data center. That's the key part of it. And we see that\ncontinuing. And that's the second phase of my VMware story. First phase is convince these people to convert from perpetual subscription so doing purchase\nVCF. Second phase now, is make that purchase they made on VCF very create the value they look for in private cloud on their premise, on their IT data center.\nThat's what's happening. And then and that will sustain for quite a while because on top of that, we will start selling advanced services, security, disaster\nrecovery, even AI running AI workloads on it. All that is very exciting. Your second question is, is that able to let me enable me to sell more hardware No. Why it's\nquite independent? In fact, as they virtualize their data centers, we consciously accept the fact that we are commoditizing the underlying hardware in the data\ncenter. Commoditizing servers, commoditizing storage, commoditizing even networking. And that's fine. And by so commoditizing, we're actually reducing cost of\ninvestments in hardware in a in data centers for enterprises. Now beyond the largest largest 10,000 are we seeing a lot of success? We're seeing some. But\nagain, two reasons why we do not expect it to be as necessary successful. One is the you know, the the value the TCO as they call it, that comes from it will be\nmuch less. But the more important thing is the skill sets that needs to not just deploy that you can get. Services and ourselves to help them, but to keep operating\nmight not be something that they can take on. And we shall see. This is a area this is an area we're still learning.

Thank you. I didn't expect that to come out. And I appreciate that. Well, you know I'm biased, to be honest. But it's so obvious I\ncan't help but being biased. Because Ethernet is well proven. Ethernet is so known to the engineers, the architects that sits in all these hyperscalers. Developing,\ndesigning AI data center, data AI infrastructure. It's the logical thing for them to use. And they are using it. And they are focusing on it. And the development of\nseparate individualized protocol, frankly, You know, it's beyond my imagination why they bother. Ethernet is there. It's been well used. It's proven. It can keep\ngoing up. The only thing people talk about is perhaps latency. Especially in scaling up. Hence, the the the emergence of NVLink. And even then, as I indicated,\nit's not hard for us, and we are not the only one who can who can do that. Quite a few others in Ethernet can do it in the switches. You can just tweak the\nswitches to make the latency super good. Better than NVLink, better than InfiniBand. Less than 250, you know, nanoseconds. Easily. And that's what we did. So\nit's not that hard. And perhaps this is why I say that because we we have been doing it as the in as the Ethernet has been around the last twenty five years at\nlength. So it's there that they know there's no need to go and create some cook up protocols that now you have to bring people around. Ethernet is the way to go\nand we and there's plenty of competition too because it's an open source system. So I think Ethernet is way to go and for sure in developing x XPUs for our\ncustomers, all these experience with the agreement of customers are made compatible interface with Ethernet. And not some fancy other interface that one has\nto keep going as bandwidth increase. And we and and I assure you, we have competition, which is one of the why the hyper scalars like the net. It's not just us.\nThey can find somebody else if for whatever reason they don't like us, and we're open to that. It's always good to do that. It's an open source system and lock and\nthere are players in that market. Not any core system. Switching on to XPU competition, Yeah. You you hear about we hear about competition and all that. It's\njust that it's it's a competition that's it's an area that we always see competition and our only way to secure a position is we try to out invest and now innovate\nanybody else in this game. We have been fortunate to be the first one creating this XPU model of a six. On silicon. And we also have been fortunate to be\nprobably one of the largest IP developers of semiconductor out there. Things like serializer, deserializer, SerDes been able to develop the best packaging been\nable to do redesign things that are very low power. So just have to keep investing in it, which we do.

As the data centers for AI clusters get bigger and bigger, it makes sense to\nhave differentiation, efficiency, etcetera. Therefore, the case for XPUs why should I not think that your XPU share at these three or four customers that that are\nexisting will be bigger than the GPU share in the longer term. It will be. It's a logical conclusion. Yeah. As you're correct. And we are seeing that step by step. As I\nsay, it's a journey It's a multiyear journey because it's multigenerational. Because this experience don't stay still either. I'm doing multiple versions least two\nversions, two generation version for each of these customers we have. And with each newer generation, they increase the consumption, the usage of the XPU as\nthey gain confidence, as the model improves, they deploy it even more. So that's the logical trend that XPUs will keep in this few customers of ours, whereas they\nare successfully deployed and their software stabilizes the software stack, the libraries that sits on these chips stabilizes and proves itself out. They'll get they'll\nhave the confidence to keep using a higher and higher percentage of their compute footprint in their own XPUs. For sure.
