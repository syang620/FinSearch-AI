In our fiscal Q4 2023, consolidated net revenue was $9.3 billion, up 4% year-on-year and very much \nas we had guided at the last conference call. Semiconductor solutions revenue increased 3% year-on-year to $7.3 billion, and infrastructure software revenue \ngrew 7% year-on-year to $2 billion. Overall, while infrastructure software remains very stable, semiconductor is continuing the cyclical slowdown at enterprises \nand telcos that we have been seeing over the past six months. However, hyperscalers remain strong. Generative AI revenue, driven by Ethernet solutions and \ncustom AI accelerators, represented close to $1.5 billion in Q4 or 20% of semiconductor revenue, while the rest of the semiconductor revenue continued to be \nrather stable at around $6 billion. Moving on to results for the year. For fiscal 2023, consolidated revenue hit a record $35.8 billion, growing 8% year-on-year. And \nsince 2020, even though we have not made an acquisition, we have shown a robust trajectory of growth, driven by semiconductor growing at an 18% CAGR over \nthe past three years. In fiscal 2023, operating profit grew by 9% year-on-year, and our free cash flow grew 8% year-on-year to $17.6 billion or 49% of revenue. \nWe returned $13.5 billion in cash to our shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. As you well know, we just closed the acquisition of VMware on \nNovember 22, just about four weeks into Broadcom\u2019s fiscal 2024. We are now refocusing VMware on its core business of creating private and hybrid cloud \nenvironments among large enterprises globally and divesting noncore assets. Reflecting the consolidation of a restructured VMware into our 2024 outlook, we \nforecast our fiscal year \u201824 consolidated revenue to be $50 billion. We expect the integration to take about a year and will require close to $1 billion in transition \nspending, which will largely be done as we exit fiscal \u201824. Regardless, we expect our fiscal year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 60% of revenue. \nKirsten will give you more details in her section. Now, let me give you more color on our two reporting segments, and I\u2019ll start with software. In Q4, as you know, \nthere\u2019s no VMware revenue and the infrastructure software business of CA, Symantec and Brocade grew 7% year-on-year to $2 billion. Consolidated renewal \nrates averaged 119% over expiring contracts. And in our strategic accounts, we actually averaged 130%. Over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring \nsubscription and maintenance. For the year, renewal rates averaged 116% over expiring contracts and in strategic accounts, we averaged 124%. Revenue in \nfiscal 2023 was $7.6 billion, up 3% year-on-year and our expectation for fiscal \u201824 is for this revenue to be $8 billion, which is 4% year-on-year. For the s2024 \noutlook, we are excited to now include VMware. As we all know, VMware has the leading technology to virtualize entire data centers, not just compute, and by \ndoing so, create private cloud on-prem. Our strategy going forward is simply to enable global enterprises to run their applications across the other data centers as \nwell as on public clouds by consuming VMware\u2019s higher-value software stack. And to attract and keep these workloads across the environment, we are investing \nin a rich catalog of microservices tools. This will be our focus. And the noncore businesses of end-user computing and Carbon Black will be divested. So for 2024, \nbased on 11 months of contribution from VMware, we expect VMware to contribute $12 billion in revenue. And on a consolidated basis, we expect our \ninfrastructure software revenue in 2024 to be $20 billion. Turning now to the semiconductor segment. Let me give you more color by end markets. Q4 networking \nrevenue of $3.1 billion grew 23% year-on-year, representing 42% of our semiconductor revenue. This was primarily driven by strong demand from hyperscalers \nfor our custom AI accelerators and as well for our networking switches, routers and NICs, Network Interface Cards, dedicated towards scaling our AI data centers. \nAs you know, even as Ethernet is the standard protocol in front-end networks, hyperscalers are also deploying Ethernet predominantly in their AI networks. In \nfiscal \u201823, networking revenue grew 21% year-on-year to $10.8 billion. If we exclude the AI accelerators, networking connectivity represented about $8 billion, and \nthis is purely silicon, not systems, not cable nor subsystems. In fiscal 2024, we expect networking revenue to grow 30% year-on-year, driven by accelerating \ndeployment of networking connectivity and expansion of AI accelerators in hyperscalers. Moving to wireless. Consistent with the seasonal launch by our North \nAmerican customers, Q4 wireless revenue of $2 billion increased 23% sequentially and declined 3% year-on-year, representing 27% of semiconductor revenue. \nIn fiscal \u201823, wireless revenue was relatively flat at $7.3 billion, just down 2% year-on-year. The engagement with our North American customers continues to be \ndeep, strategic and multiyear. And accordingly, in fiscal \u201824, we expect wireless revenue to again remain stable year-on-year. Next, our Q4 server storage \nconnectivity revenue was $1 billion or 14% of semiconductor revenue and down 17% year-on-year. In fiscal \u201823, server storage connectivity was $4.5 billion, up \n11% year-on-year. And going to fiscal \u201824, we expect server storage revenue to decline mid- to high-teens percentage year-on-year, driven by the cyclical \nweakness that began late \u201823. And moving on to broadband. Q4 revenue declined 9% year-on-year to $950 million, in line with expectations and represented 13% \nof semiconductor revenue. And in fiscal \u201823, broadband revenue was $4.5 billion and up 8% year-on-year. Moving on to fiscal \u201824, we expect broadband revenue \nto be down low- to mid-teens percentage year-on-year and reflecting, again, the further slowdown as the cyclical weakness at service providers that began in late \n\u201823 continues into fiscal \u201824. And finally, Q4 industrial sales of $236 million was stable year-on-year. In fiscal \u201823, industrial resales were $962 million. In fiscal \u201824, \nwe expect industrial resales to be down low single digits year-on-year. So in summary, fiscal \u201823 semiconductor solutions revenue was up 9% year-on-year to \n$28.2 billion. Revenue from generative AI in fiscal \u201823 reached 15% of semiconductor revenue, in line with our expectation. And moving on to fiscal \u201824, we \nforecast semiconductor solutions revenue to be up mid- to high-single-digit percent year-on-year. We expect revenue from generative AI to represent more than \n25% of the semiconductor revenue, consistent with prior guidance, which more than offset the lack of growth from non-AI semiconductor revenue. With the \nconsolidation of VMware, bringing our Infrastructure Software segment revenue to $20 billion and the semiconductor segment holding at mid-high single digit \ngrowth year-on-year, we are, therefore, guiding our fiscal \u201824 revenue to be $50 billion, which represents 40% year-on-year growth from fiscal \u201823. With that, let\n\nme turn the call over to Kirsten.", "char_count": 7189, "word_count": 1117, "token_count": 1622, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}
{"doc_id": "AVGO_2023_Q4", "ticker": "AVGO", "year": 2023, "quarter": 4, "filing_date": "2023-12-01", "phase": "prepared_remarks", "speaker_name": "Kirsten Spears", "speaker_role": "CFO", "speaker_firm": null, "utterance_id": "u_0003", "utterance_type": "statement", "text": "Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q4 financial performance. Consolidated revenue was $9.3 billion for the quarter, up 4% from a year\nago. Gross margins were 74.3% of revenue in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, flat year-on-year. R&D of $940\nmillion was also stable year-on-year. Operating income for the quarter was $5.7 billion and was up 4% from a year ago, with operating margin at 62% of revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $6 billion or 65% of revenue, in line with expectations. This figure excludes $124 million of depreciation. Now, a review of the P&L for our\ntwo segments, starting with our semiconductor segment. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $7.3 billion and represented 79% of total\nrevenue in the quarter. This was up 3% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 70%, down 110 basis points\nyear-on-year driven primarily by product mix within our semiconductor end markets. Operating expenses were stable year-on-year at $822 million, resulting in\noperating profit growth of 2% year-on-year and semiconductor operating margins of 58%. Now, moving on to our infrastructure software segment. Revenue for\ninfrastructure software was $2 billion, up 7% year-on-year and represented 21% of revenue. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 92% in the quarter,\nand operating expenses were $339 million in the quarter. Q4 operating profit grew 12% year-on-year with infrastructure software operating margin at 75%. Now\nmoving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.7 billion and represented 51% of revenues in Q4. We spent $105 million on capital expenditures.\nDays sales outstanding were 31 days in the fourth quarter compared to 30 days in the third. We ended the fourth quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, up 3%\nsequentially. We continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We exited the quarter with 76 days of inventory on hand,\ndown 80 days in Q3. We ended the fourth quarter with $14.2 billion of cash and $39.2 billion of gross debt, of which $1.6 billion is short term. Now let me recap\nour financial performance for fiscal 2023. Our revenue hit a record $35.8 billion, growing 8% year-on-year. Semiconductor revenue was $28.2 billion, up 9%\nyear-over-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $7.6 billion, up 3% year-on-year. Gross margin for the year was 74.7%, down 90 basis points from a year\nago. Operating expenses were $4.6 billion, down 4% year-on-year. Fiscal 2023 operating income was $22.1 billion, up 9% year-over-year and represented 62%\nof net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $23.2 billion, up 10% year-over-year and represented 65% of net revenue. This figure excludes $502 million of\ndepreciation. We spent $452 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow grew 8% year-on-year to $17.6 billion or 49% of fiscal 2023 revenue. Now,\nturning to capital allocation. For fiscal 2023, we spent $15.3 billion, consisting of $7.6 billion in the form of cash dividends and $7.7 billion in share repurchases\nand eliminations. We ended the year with $7.2 billion of authorized share repurchase programs remaining. With the VMware deal closed, we have resumed\nrepurchasing shares under our existing program. In fiscal year 2024, including the incremental shares from the acquisition of VMware and excluding the potential\nimpact of any share repurchases, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be approximately 494 million. Aligned with our ability to generate increased\ncash flows in the preceding year and now off of a larger share count base from the acquisition of VMware, we are announcing an increase in our quarterly\ncommon stock cash dividend in Q1 fiscal 2024 to $5.25 per share, an increase of 14% from the prior quarter. We intend to maintain this target quarterly dividend\nthroughout fiscal \u201824 subject to quarterly Board approval. This implies our fiscal 2024 annual common stock dividend to be a record $21 per share. I would like to\nhighlight that this represents the 13th consecutive increase in annual dividends since we initiated dividends in fiscal 2011. Now on to guidance. As Hock\ndiscussed, with the recent closing of our VMware acquisition and the integration process, which will take at least one year, for fiscal 2024, we will provide our\noutlook for the full year instead of quarterly guidance. Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for fiscal year 2024 is for consolidated\nrevenues of $50 billion. Within this, our fiscal year 2024 semiconductor revenue is expected to grow mid- to high-single-digit percent year-on-year. Our fiscal year\n2024 infrastructure software segment revenue from continuing operations is expected to be $20 billion, including $8 billion from CA, Symantec Enterprise and\nBrocade and $12 billion from VMware. With regard to VMware, our forecast for fiscal \u201824 revenue of $12 billion reflects 11 months of contribution from VMware.\nThis does not include revenue from EUC and Carbon Black of approximately $2 billion, which we plan to divest. We are also converting an installed base of\nlicenses that is over 60% perpetual today to one that will be mostly subscription by the end of fiscal 2024. Offsetting these, our new strategy for VMware will\naccelerate revenue growth over the next three years. During fiscal \u201824, we expect to incur about $1 billion of spend related to transitioning VMware into the new\nBroadcom model. This transition spending will be largely completed by the end of the fiscal year as our VMware spending run rate exits fiscal \u201824 at approximately\n$1.4 billion per quarter, down 40% from a year ago. So, in fiscal year 2024, including VMware, we expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately 60% of\nprojected revenue. That concludes my prepared remarks.

Starting with the first part, I mean, it\u2019s -- what we\u2019re seeing is a market that continues to grow, to accelerate. What \nis also very obvious is it\u2019s very, very dynamic as architectures of large language models, software models continues to change, I mean, literally change on the fly. \nWe are also seeing the requirements for compute silicon change. And it\u2019s very interesting, very fascinating for us, but it also presents quite an interesting \nopportunity, which is to say that if a customer has a business model that is substantial and have resources which obviously supports that, is getting to a stage that \nit might make a lot of sense to design AI compute engines, which comprises memory as well as the compute engine itself, then that can be tailored or better word, \ncustomized for their particular requirements on applications, on their particular LLM model. And we\u2019re seeing this as we all are seeing LLM models continue to \nchange and the face -- the shape of generative AI dynamically change more and more, where training and inference are now starting to, in a way, converge and \nthe chip designs are changing. And we are seeing that in the way we design specific custom chips for hyperscalers. That\u2019s interesting. So that\u2019s a very interesting \nopportunity for us. And as I indicated in my remarks, we see that revenue as part of networking revenue, $4 billion and networking -- AI networks and going -- \ndoubling almost during 2024. Nothing new. We have said that before. And if anything else, we are reinforcing that particular guidance. Now, networking is \nparticularly interesting as you heard in my opening remarks. It is accelerating as fast as our AI accelerators, the compute engines are growing. And we see that \ngrowing hand in hand and particularly so as training -- continuous training of very large language models with very different and very large parameters keep going \non and things keep changing. So we\u2019re seeing no slowdown, in fact, in the update on building out this AI networks. If anything else on average, we are seeing a \ndoubling on size of those networks across the board. So, that\u2019s -- to your answer question. Yes, I fully concur with AMD, when they indicate that it looks like\n\ndemand appears to be accelerating rather than staying stable or decelerating.\nOperator\nThank you.

Other than that, I\u2019d rather not disclose any more to you at this point because we\u2019re kind of under NDA overall.\nOperator\nThank you. One moment for our next question.

You\u2019re right, we had a great opportunity, and\nthanks to a very supportive management team from VMware that engages with us very, very well. Again, it\u2019s planning. We can see, we can\u2019t touch, but it has a lot\nof time to plan and think through. It also gives me a lot of opportunity to go out there. And over the past 12, 16 months, I must have talked one-on-one or in small\ngroups to at least 150 CIOs globally of the largest customers of VMware out there. And one thing is very clear. The VMware core product, the VMware Cloud\nFoundation software stack that enables virtualization of not just computing, servers, compute, but storage, networking as well as orchestration and management\nlayer over that whole stack is something that CIOs, head of infrastructure of large -- many large companies out there really want. They want to be able to deploy.\nThey want to make their data centers, which is very heterogenous now between virtualization and compute to bare metal and the mix environment and different\nvendors where each is trying to optimize best-of-breed to one that is managing under a single abstraction layer across a diversity of hardware. That saves a lot of\nhardware purchases. That creates a lot of cost reduction in a way to manage it. That is the value of the technology VMware brings to bear. And the products are\nthere. For us is focusing and execution, which is what you hear us say that today and which is what you hear Kirsten lay out in the numbers we are looking at just\nin the first year of completion of this acquisition.\n\nOperator\nAnd that concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session.
