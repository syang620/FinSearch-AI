Tan\nThank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. In our fiscal Q2 2025, total revenue was a record $15 billion, up 20% year-on-year. This 20%\nyear-on-year growth was all organic as Q2 last year was the first full quarter with VMware. Now revenue was driven by continued strength in AI semiconductors\nand the momentum we have achieved in VMware. Now reflecting excellent operating leverage, Q2 consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $10 billion, up 35%\nyear-on-year. Now let me provide more color. Q2 semiconductor revenue was $8.4 billion, with growth accelerating to 17% year-on-year, up from 11% in Q1. And\nof course, driving this growth was AI semiconductor revenue of over $4.4 billion, which is up 46% year-on-year and continues the trajectory of 9 consecutive\nquarters of strong growth. Within this, custom AI accelerators grew double digits year-on-year, while AI networking grew over 170% year-on-year. AI networking,\nwhich is based on Ethernet was robust and represented 40% of our AI revenue. As a standard-based open protocol, Ethernet enables one single fabric for both\nscale out and scale up and remains the preferred choice by our hyperscale customers. Our networking portfolio of Tomahawk switches, Jericho routers and NICs\nis what's driving our success within AI clusters in hyperscalers. And the momentum continues with our breakthrough Tomahawk 6 switch just announced this\nweek. This represents the next- generation 102.4 terabits per second switch capacity. Tomahawk 6 enables clusters of more than 100,000 AI accelerators to be\ndeployed in just 2 tiers instead of 3. This flattening of the AI cluster is huge because it enables much better performance in training next-generation frontier\nmodels through a lower latency, higher bandwidth and lower power. Turning to XPUs or custom accelerators. We continue to make excellent progress on the\nmultiyear journey of enabling our 3 customers and 4 prospects to deploy custom AI accelerators. As we had articulated over 6 months ago, we eventually expect\nat least 3 customers to each deploy 1 million AI accelerated clusters in 2027, largely for training their frontier models. And we forecast and continue to do so a\nsignificant percentage of these deployments to be custom XPUs. These partners are still unwavering in their plan to invest despite the certain economic\nenvironment. In fact, what we've seen recently is that they are doubling down on inference in order to monetize their platforms. And reflecting this, we may\nactually see an acceleration of XPU demand into the back half of 2026 to meet urgent demand for inference on top of the demand we have indicated from\ntraining. And accordingly, we do anticipate now our fiscal 2025 growth rate of AI semiconductor revenue to sustain into fiscal 2026. Turning to our Q3 outlook. As\nwe continue our current trajectory of growth, we forecast AI semiconductor revenue to be $5.1 billion, up 60% year-on-year, which would be the 10th consecutive\nquarter of growth. Now turning to non-AI semiconductors in Q2. Revenue of $4 billion was down 5% year-on-year. Non-AI semiconductor revenue is close to the\nbottom, has been relatively slow to recover, but they had bright spots. In Q2, broadband, enterprise networking and server storage revenues were up\nsequentially. However, industrial was down and as expected, wireless was also down due to seasonality. In Q3, we expect enterprise networking and broadband\nto continue to grow sequentially, but server storage, wireless and industrial are expected to be largely flat. And overall, we forecast non-AI semiconductor revenue\nto stay around $4 billion. Now let me talk about our infrastructure software segment. Q2 infrastructure software revenue of $6.6 billion was up 25% year-on-year,\nabove our outlook of $6.5 billion. As we have said before, this growth reflects our success in converting our enterprise customers from perpetual vSphere to the\nfull VCF software stack subscription. Customers are increasingly turning to VCF to create a modernized private cloud on-prem, which will enable them to\nrepatriate workloads from public clouds while being able to run modern container-based applications and AI applications. Of our 10,000 largest customers, over\n87% have now adopted VCF. The momentum from strong VCF sales over the past 18 months since the acquisition of VMware has created annual recurring\nrevenue or otherwise known as ARR growth of double digits in our core infrastructure software. In Q3, we expect infrastructure software revenue to be\napproximately $6.7 billion, up 16% year-on-year. So in total, we are guiding Q3 consolidated revenue to be approximately $15.8 billion, up 21% year-on-year. We\nexpect Q3 adjusted EBITDA to be at least 66%. With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.\nKirsten M. Spears\nThank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q2 financial performance. Consolidated revenue was a record $15 billion for the quarter, up 20% \nfrom a year ago. Gross margin was 79.4% of revenue in the quarter, better than we originally guided on product mix. Consolidated operating expenses were $2.1 \nbillion, of which $1.5 billion was related to R&D. Q2 operating income of $9.8 billion was up 37% from a year ago, with operating margin at 65% of revenue. \nAdjusted EBITDA was $10 billion or 67% of revenue, above our guidance of 66%. This figure excludes $142 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for \nour 2 segments. Starting with semiconductors. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $8.4 billion, with growth accelerating to 17% year-on-year, \ndriven by AI. Semiconductor revenue represented 56% of total revenue in the quarter. Gross margin for our semiconductor solutions segment was approximately \n69%, up 140 basis points year-on-year driven by product mix. Operating expenses increased 12% year-on-year to $971 million on increased investment in R&D \nfor leading edge AI semiconductors. Semiconductor operating margin of 57% was up 200 basis points year-on-year. Now moving on to infrastructure software. \nRevenue for infrastructure software of $6.6 billion was up 25% year-on-year and represented 44% of total revenue. Gross margin for infrastructure software was \n93% in the quarter compared to 88% a year ago. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software operating margin of \napproximately 76%. This compares to operating margin of 60% a year ago. This year-on-year improvement reflects our disciplined integration of VMware. Moving\n\non to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $6.4 billion and represented 43% of revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue continues to be\nimpacted by increased interest expense from debt related to the VMware acquisition and increased cash taxes. We spent $144 million on capital expenditures.\nDay sales outstanding were 34 days in the second quarter compared to 40 days a year ago. We ended the second quarter with inventory of $2 billion, up 6%\nsequentially in anticipation of revenue growth in future quarters. Our days of inventory on hand were 69 days in Q2 as we continue to remain disciplined on how\nwe manage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the second quarter with $9.5 billion of cash and $69.4 billion of gross principal debt. Subsequent to\nquarter end, we repaid $1.6 billion of debt, resulting in gross principal debt of $67.8 billion. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $59.8\nbillion in fixed rate debt is 3.8% and 7 years, respectively. The weighted average interest rate and years to maturity of our $8 billion in floating rate debt is 5.3%\nand 2.6 years, respectively. Turning to capital allocation. In Q2, we paid stockholders $2.8 billion of cash dividends based on a quarterly common stock cash\ndividend of $0.59 per share. In Q2, we repurchased $4.2 billion or approximately 25 million shares of common stock. In Q3, we expect the non-GAAP diluted\nshare count to be approximately 4.97 billion shares, excluding the potential impact of any share repurchases. Now moving on to guidance. Our guidance for Q3 is\nfor consolidated revenue of $15.8 billion, up 21% year-on-year. We forecast semiconductor revenue of approximately $9.1 billion, up 25% year-on-year. Within\nthis, we expect Q3 AI semiconductor revenue of $5.1 billion, up 60% year-on-year. We expect infrastructure software revenue of approximately $6.7 billion, up\n16% year-on-year. For modeling purposes, we expect Q3 consolidated gross margin to be down approximately 130 basis points sequentially, primarily reflecting\na higher mix of XPUs within AI revenue. As a reminder, consolidated gross margins through the year will be impacted by the revenue mix of infrastructure\nsoftware and semiconductors. We expect Q3 adjusted EBITDA to be at least 66%. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate for Q3 and fiscal year 2025 to remain at\n14%. And with this, that concludes my prepared remarks.

Sur\nGreat job on the quarterly execution. Hock, good to see the positive growth inflection quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year growth rates in your AI business. As the\nteam has mentioned, right, the quarters can be a bit lumpy. So if I smooth out kind of first 3 quarters of this fiscal year, your AI business is up 60% year-over-year.\nIt's kind of right in line with your 3-year kind of SAM growth CAGR, right? Given your prepared remarks and knowing that your lead times remain at 35 weeks or\nbetter, do you see the Broadcom team sustaining the 60% year-over-year growth rate exiting this year. And I assume that, that potentially implies that you see\nyour AI business sustaining the 60% year-over-year growth rate into fiscal '26, again, based on your prepared commentary, which again is in line with your SAM\ngrowth figure. Is that kind of a fair way to think about the trajectory this year and next year?\nHock E. Tan\nHarlan, that's a very insightful set of analysis here, and that's exactly what we're trying to do here because over 6 months ago, we gave you guys a point, a year,\n2027. As we come into the second half of 2025 and with improved visibility and updates we are seeing in the way our hyperscale partners are deploying data\ncenters, AI clusters, we are providing you some level of guidance visibility what we are seeing, how the trajectory of '26 might look like.

Can you discuss workloads that are optimal that you're seeing for custom silicon?\nAnd that over time, what percentage of your XPU business could be inference versus training?\nHock E. Tan\nI think there's no differentiation between training and inference in using merchant accelerators versus custom accelerators. I think the whole premise behind going\ntowards custom accelerators continues, which is it's not a matter of cost alone. It is that as custom accelerators get used and get developed on a road map with\nany particular hyperscaler, there's a learning curve, a learning curve on how they could optimize the way the algorithms on their large language models gets\nwritten and tied to silicon. And that ability to do so is a huge value added in creating algorithms that can drive their LLMs to higher and higher performance, much\nmore than basically a segregation approach between hardware and the software. It's that you literally combine end-to-end hardware and software as they take\nthat journey. And it's a journey. They don't learn that in 1 year. Do it a few cycles, get better and better at it. And there lies the value -- the fundamental value in\ncreating your own hardware versus using a third-party merchant silicon that you are able to optimize your software to the hardware and eventually achieve way\nhigh performance than you otherwise could.

I was hoping you could discuss how important is demand adoption for\nco-packaged optics in achieving this 5 to 10x higher content for scale-up networks? Or should we anticipate much of the scale-up opportunity will be driven by\nTomahawk and Thor NICs?\nHock E. Tan\nI'm trying to decipher this question of yours. So let me try to answer it perhaps in the way I think you want me to clarify. First and foremost, I think most of what's\nscaling up, a lot of the scaling up that's going, as I call it, which means a lot of XPU or GPU to GPU interconnects is done on copper interconnects. And because\nthe size of this scale-up cluster is still not that huge yet that you can get away with copper -- using copper interconnects. And they're still doing it. Mostly, they're\ndoing it today. At some point soon, I believe, when you start trying to go beyond maybe 72 GPU to GPU interconnects, you may have to push towards a different\nprotocol by protocol mode at a different medium from copper to optical. And when we do that, yes, perhaps then things like exotic stuff like co-packaging might be\nof silicon with optical might become relevant. But truly, what we really are talking about is that at some stage, as the clusters get larger and which means scale up\nbecomes much bigger and you need to interconnect GPU or XPU to each other in scale up many more than just 72 or 100, maybe even 128, you start going\nmore and more. You want to use optical interconnects simply because of distance. And that's when optical will start replacing copper. And when that happens,\nthe question is what's the best way to deliver on optical. And one way is co-packaged optics, but it's not the only way. You can just simply use -- continue to use\nperhaps pluggable at low-cost optics. In which case, then you can interconnect the bandwidth, the radix of a switch and our switch is now 512 connections. So\nyou can now connect all these XPUs, GPUs, 512 for scale-up phenomenon. And that was huge, but that's when you go to optical. That's going to happen within\nmy view, a year or 2, and we'll be right at the forefront of it.

Does opening up NVLink change the landscape? And sort of how do you view of your AI networking growth next year? Do you think it's going to be\nprimarily driven by scale up? Or will it still be pretty scale-out heavy?\nHock E. Tan\nIt's -- people do like to create platforms and new protocols and systems. The fact of the matter is scale up can just be done easily, and it's currently available. It's\nopen standards, open source, Ethernet. Just as well, you don't need to create new systems for the sake of doing something that you could easily be doing in\nnetworking in Ethernet. And so yes, I hear a lot of this interesting new protocols, standards that are trying to be created. And most of them, by the way, are\nproprietary, much as they like to call it otherwise. What is really open source and open standards is Ethernet. And we believe Ethernet will prevail as it does\nbefore -- for the last 20 years in traditional networking.

My question is for you, Hock. It's kind of a bigger picture one here. And this kind of acceleration that we're seeing in AI demand, do you think that this\nacceleration is because of a marked improvement in ASICs or XPUs closing the gap on the software side at your customers? Do you think it's these require\ntokenomics around inference, test time compute driving that, for example. What do you think is actually driving the upside here? And do you think it leads to a\nmarket share shift faster than we were expecting towards XPU from GPU?\nHock E. Tan\nYes. Interesting question, but none of the foregoing that you outlined. It's very simple, why inference has come out very, very hot lately is -- remember, we're only\nselling to a few customers, hyperscalers with platforms and LLMs. That's it. There are not that many. And we have told you how many we have, and we haven't\nincreased any. But what is happening is these hyperscalers and those with LLMs need to justify all the spending they're doing. Doing training makes your frontier\nmodels smarter. There's no question. It's almost like science, research and science. Make your frontier models by creating very clever algorithms that consumes\na lot of compute for training smarter. Training makes it smarter. You want to monetize inference. And that's what's driving it. Monetize, I indicated in my prepared\nremarks, to drive to justify a return on investment and a lot of that investment is training and that return on investment is by creating use cases, a lot of AI use\ncases, AI consumption out there through availability of a lot of inference.

But I guess, Hock, given the execution that you guys have been able to do with the VMware integration,\nlooking at the balance sheet, looking at the debt structure, I'm curious if you could give us your thoughts on how the company thinks about capital return versus\nthe thoughts on M&A and the strategy going forward.\nHock E. Tan\nOkay. That's an interesting question. And I agree, not too untimely, I would say, because, yes, we have done a lot of the integration of VMware now, and you can\nsee that in the level of free cash flow we're generating from operations. And as we said, the use of capital has always been -- we're very, I guess, measured and\nupfront with a return through dividends, which is half our free cash flow of the preceding year. And frankly, as Kirsten has mentioned 3 months ago and 6 months\nago during the last 2 earnings call, the first choice typically of the other part of the free cash flow is to bring down our debt to a more -- to a level that we feel\ncloser to no more than 2 ratio of debt to EBITDA. And that doesn't mean that opportunistically, we may go out there and buy back our shares as we did last\nquarter, and indicated by Kirsten, when we did $4.2 billion of stock buyback. Now part of it is used to basically when employee RSUs vest basically use -- we\nbasically buy back part of the shares used to be paying taxes on the vested RSU. But the other part of it, I do admit we used it opportunistically last quarter when\nwe see an situation when basically, we think that it's a good time to buy some shares back, and we do. But having said all that, our use of cash outside of\ndividends would be, at this stage, used towards reducing our debt. And I know you're going to ask what about M&A? Well, the kind of M&A we will do in our view\nwould be significant, would be substantial enough that we need debt in any case. And it's a good use of our free cash flow to bring down debt to, in a way,\nexpand, if not preserve our borrowing capacity if we have to do another M&A deal.\nOperator\nOne moment for our next question.
