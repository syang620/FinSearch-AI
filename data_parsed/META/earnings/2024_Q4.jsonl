Thanks, Ken. Thanks everyone for joining today. We ended 2024 on a strong note with now more than 3.3 billion people using at least one of our apps\neach day. This is going to be a really big year. I know it always feels like every year is a big year, but more than usual it feels like the trajectory for most of our\nlong-term initiatives is going to be a lot clearer by the end of this year. So I keep telling our teams that this is going to be intense, because we have about\n48-weeks to get on the trajectory we want to be on. In AI, I expect this is going to be the year when a highly intelligent and personalized AI assistant reaches\nmore than 1 billion people, and I expect Meta AI to be that leading AI assistant. Meta AI is already used by more people than any other assistant, and once a\nservice reaches that kind of scale it usually develops a durable long-term advantage. We have a really exciting roadmap for this year with a unique vision focused\non personalization. We believe that people don't all want to use the same AI, people want their AI to be personalized to their context, their interests, their\npersonality, their culture, and how they think about the world. I don't think that there's just going to be one big AI that everyone uses that does the same thing.\nPeople are going to get to choose how their AI works and what it looks like for them. I continue to think that this is going to be one of the most transformative\nproducts that we\u2019ve made. And we have some fun surprises that I think people are going to like this year. I think this very well be the year when Llama and open\nsource become the most advanced and widely used AI models as well. Llama 4 is making great progress in training. Llama 4 mini is done with pre-training and\nour reasoning models and larger model are looking good too. Our goal with Llama 3 was to make open source competitive with closed models, and our goal for\nLlama 4 is to lead. Llama 4 will be natively multimodal; it's an omni-model and will have agentic capabilities, so it's going to be novel and it\u2019s going to unlock a lot\nof new use cases. I'm looking forward to sharing more of our plan for the year on that over the next couple of months. I also expect that 2025 will be the year\nwhen it becomes possible to build an AI engineering agent that has coding and problem-solving abilities of around a good mid-level engineer. And this is going to\nbe a profound milestone and potentially one of the most important innovations in history, as well as over time, potentially a very large market. Whichever company\nbuilds this first I think is going to have a meaningful advantage in deploying it to advance their AI research and shape the field. So that's another reason why I\nthink that this year is going to set the course for the future. Our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses are a real hit, and this will be the year when we understand the\ntrajectory for AI glasses as a category. Many breakout products in the history of consumer electronics have sold 5 million to 10 million units in their third\ngeneration. This will be a defining year that determines if we're on a path towards many hundreds of millions and eventually billions of AI glasses and glasses\nbeing the next computing platform like we've been talking about for some time or if this is just going to be a longer grind. But it's great overall to see people\nrecognizing that these glasses are the perfect form factor for AI, as well as just great, stylish glasses. These are all big investments, especially the hundreds of\nbillions of dollars that we will invest in AI infrastructure over the long-term. I announced last week that we expect to bring online almost 1 gigawatt of capacity this\nyear, and we're building a 2 gigawatt and potentially bigger AI datacenter, that is so big that it will cover a significant part of Manhattan if it were placed there.\nWe're planning to fund all this by at the same time investing aggressively in initiatives that use these AI advances to increase revenue growth. And we've put\ntogether a plan that will hopefully accelerate the pace of these initiatives over the next few years. That\u2019s what a lot of our new headcount growth is going towards.\nAnd how well we execute on this will also determine our financial trajectory over the next few years. There are a number of other important product trends related\nto our family of apps that I think we\u2019re going to know more about this year as well. We're going to learn what's going to happen with TikTok, and regardless of that\nI expect Reels on Instagram and Facebook to continue growing. I expect Threads to continue on its trajectory to become the leading discussion platform and\neventually reach 1 billion people over the next several years. Threads now has more than 320 million monthly actives and has been adding more than 1 million\nsign-ups per day. I expect WhatsApp to continue gaining share and making progress towards becoming the leading messaging platform in the U.S. like it is in a\nlot of the rest of the world. WhatsApp now has more than 100 million monthly actives in the U.S. Facebook is used by more than 3 billion monthly actives and\nwe're focused on growing its cultural influence. And I'm excited this year to get back to some OG Facebook. All right. So this is also going to be a pivotal year for\nthe metaverse. The number of people using Quest and Horizon has been steadily growing, and this is a year when a number of long-term investments that we've\nbeen working on that will make the metaverse more visually stunning and inspiring will really start to land. So I think we\u2019re going to know a lot more about\nHorizon's trajectory by the end of this year. This is also going to be a big year for redefining our relationship with governments. We now have a U.S.\nadministration that is proud of our leading companies, prioritizes American technology winning, and that will defend our values and interests abroad. And I'm\noptimistic about the progress and innovation this is can unlock. So this is going to be a big year. I think this is the most exciting and dynamic that I have ever seen\nour industry. Between AI, glasses, massive infrastructure projects, doing a bunch of work to try to accelerate our business, and building the future of social media,\nwe have a lot to do. And I think we're going to build some awesome things that shape the future of human connection. As always, I'm grateful for everyone who is\non this journey with us.

Let\u2019s begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q4 \ntotal revenue was $48.4 billion, up 21% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Q4 total expenses were $25 billion, up 5%, compared to last year. Before \nI cover the specific cost lines, I would note that our fourth quarter expense growth rate reflects a 13 percentage point favorable impact from legal accrual \nreductions in Q4 and lower year-over-year restructuring costs. In terms of the specific line items. Cost of revenue increased 15%, driven mostly by higher \ninfrastructure costs. R&D increased 16%, primarily driven by higher employee compensation and infrastructure costs, which were partially offset by lower \nrestructuring costs. Marketing & Sales were approximately flat year-over-year. G&A decreased 67%, driven mostly by lower legal-related expenses due to a $1.55 \nbillion reduction in legal accruals related to certain legal proceedings. We ended the year with over 74,000 employees, up 10% year-over-year, with growth \nprimarily driven by hiring in priority areas of monetization, infrastructure, generative AI, Reality Labs, as well as regulation and compliance. Fourth quarter \noperating income was $23.4 billion, representing a 48% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 12%. Net income was $20.8 billion or $8.02 per share. \nCapital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $14.8 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network \ninfrastructure. Free cash flow was $13.2 billion. We paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders, ending the year with $77.8 billion in cash and marketable \nsecurities and $28.8 billion in debt. Moving now to our segment results. I\u2019ll begin with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps \ncontinues to grow, and we estimate more than 3.3 billion people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in December. Q4 Total Family of Apps \nrevenue was $47.3 billion, up 21% year-over-year. And Q4 Family of Apps ad revenue was $46.8 billion, up 21% on both a reported and constant currency basis. \nWithin ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was \nstrongest in Rest of World at 27%, followed by Asia-Pacific and Europe at 23% and 22%, respectively. North America grew 18%. In Q4, the total number of ad \nimpressions served across our services increased 6% and the average price per ad increased 14%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia-Pacific. Pricing \ngrowth benefited from increased advertiser demand, in part driven by improved ad performance. This was partially offset by impression growth, particularly from \nlower-monetizing regions and surfaces. Family of Apps other revenue was $519 million, up 55%, driven primarily by business messaging revenue growth from our \nWhatsApp Business Platform. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q4, Family of \nApps expenses were $19 billion, representing 76% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 5%, primarily due to growth in infrastructure costs \nand employee compensation, which were partially offset by lower legal-related expenses. Family of Apps operating income was $28.3 billion, representing a 60% \noperating margin. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q4 revenue was $1.1 billion, driven by hardware sales and up 1% year-over-year. Reality Labs expenses \nwere $6 billion, up 6% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher infrastructure costs and employee compensation, partially offset by lower restructuring costs. \nReality Labs operating loss was $5 billion. Turning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance: our ability to \ndeliver engaging experiences for our community, and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, daily actives continue to grow \nacross Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp year-over-year, both globally and in the United States. In Q4, global video time grew at double-digit percentages \nyear-over-year on Instagram, and we\u2019re seeing particular strength in the U.S. on Facebook, where video time spent was also up double-digit rates year-over-year. \nWe see continued opportunities to drive video growth in 2025 through ongoing optimizations to our ranking systems. We\u2019re also making several product bets that \nare focused on setting up our platforms for longer-term success. Creators are one of our central focuses. On Instagram, we continue to prioritize original posts in \nrecommendations to help smaller creators get discovered. We also want to ensure creators have a place to experiment with their content, so we introduced a new \nfeature in Q4 that allows creators to first share a Reel with people who don\u2019t follow them. This allows them to test content and see what performs best before \ndeciding to share it with their followers, and also helps introduce them to entirely new audiences. Creative tools is another area we\u2019re investing in. In the coming \nweeks, we\u2019ll launch a new standalone app called Edits that provides a full suite of creative tools to make it easier for creators to make great Reels on their phone. \nAnother focus is making it easier for people to connect over content. Reels are already reshared over 4.5 billion times a day, and we\u2019ve been introducing more \nfeatures that bring together the social and entertainment aspects of Instagram. In the U.S., we recently launched a new destination in Reels that consists of \ncontent your friends have left a note on or liked. We\u2019re seeing very positive early results and will look to expand this globally in the coming months. On Threads, \nwe made tremendous progress in 2024 and our focus this year is establishing Threads as the place people come to keep up with what they care about. We\u2019re \nmaking a number of updates to our recommendation systems to prioritize more recent posts, surface content from top creators, and ensure people see more of \nthe content from accounts they follow. We will also continue improving custom feeds so people can build personalized feeds on topics they\u2019re interested in. \nFinally, Meta AI usage continues to scale, with more than 700 million monthly actives. We\u2019re now introducing updates that will enable Meta AI to deliver more \npersonalized and relevant responses by remembering certain details from people\u2019s prior queries and considering what they engage with on Facebook and \nInstagram to develop better intuition for their interests and preferences. Now to the second driver of our revenue performance: increasing monetization efficiency. \nThe first part of this work is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. We continue to grow supply on lower monetizing surfaces, like video, while \noptimizing ad supply on each of our surfaces to deliver ads at the time and place they will be most relevant to people. For example, we are continuing to better \npersonalize when ads show up, including the optimal locations in the depth of someone\u2019s feed, to introduce ad supply when it\u2019s most optimal for the user and \nrevenue. This is enabling efficient supply growth. Longer term, we also see impression growth opportunities on unmonetized surfaces like Threads, which we are \nbeginning to test ads on this quarter. We expect the introduction of ads on Threads will be gradual and don\u2019t anticipate it being a meaningful driver of overall \nimpression or revenue growth in 2025. The second part of increasing monetization efficiency is improving marketing performance. The ongoing enhancements to \nour ads ranking systems are an important driver of this work. In the second-half of 2024, we introduced an innovative new machine learning system in partnership \nwith Nvidia, called Andromeda. This more efficient system enabled a 10,000 times increase in the complexity of models we use for ads retrieval, which is the part \nof the ranking process where we narrow down a pool of tens of millions of ads to the few thousand we consider showing someone. The increase in model \ncomplexity is enabling us to run far more sophisticated prediction models to better personalize, which ads we show someone. This has driven an 8% increase in \nthe quality of ads that people see on objectives we\u2019ve tested. Andromeda\u2019s ability to efficiently process larger volumes of ads also positions us well for the future \nas advertisers use our generative AI tools to create and test more ads. Another way we\u2019re delivering value for advertisers is through increased automation of their \nad campaigns with Advantage+. Adoption of Advantage+ shopping campaigns continues to scale, with revenue surpassing a $20 billion annual run-rate and \ngrowing 70% year-over-year in Q4. Given the strong performance and interest we\u2019re seeing in Advantage+ Shopping and our other end-to-end solutions, we\u2019re \ntesting a new streamlined campaign creation flow so advertisers no longer need to choose between running a manual or Advantage+ Sales or App campaign. In \nthis new setup, all campaigns optimizing for sales, app or lead objectives will have Advantage+ turned on from the beginning. This will allow more advertisers to \ntake advantage of the performance Advantage+ offers, while still having the ability to further customize aspects of their campaigns when they need to. We plan to \nexpand to more advertisers in the coming months before fully rolling it out later in the year. Advantage+ creative is another area where we\u2019re seeing momentum. \nMore than 4 million advertisers are now using at least one of our generative AI ad creative tools, up from one million six months ago. There has been significant \nearly adoption of our first video generation tool that we rolled out in October, Image Animation, with hundreds of thousands of advertisers already using it monthly. \nNext, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. Our primary focus remains investing capital back into the business, with infrastructure and talent \nbeing our top priorities. On the first, we expect compute will be central to many of the opportunities we\u2019re pursuing as we advance the capabilities of Llama, drive \nincreased usage of generative AI products and features across our platform, and fuel core ads and organic engagement initiatives. We\u2019re working to meet the \ngrowing capacity needs for these services by both scaling our infrastructure footprint and increasing the efficiency of our workloads. Another way we\u2019re pursuing \nefficiencies is by extending the useful lives of our servers and associated networking equipment. Our expectation going forward is that we\u2019ll be able to use both \nour non-AI and AI servers for a longer period of time before replacing them, which we estimate will be approximately 5.5 years. This will deliver savings in annual\n\nCapEx and resulting depreciation expense, which is already included in our guidance. Finally, we\u2019re pursuing cost efficiencies by deploying our custom MTIA\nsilicon in areas where we can achieve a lower cost of compute by optimizing the chip to our unique workloads. In 2024 we started deploying MTIA to our ranking\nand recommendation inference workloads for ads and organic content. We expect to further ramp adoption of MTIA for these use cases throughout 2025 before\nextending our custom silicon efforts to training workloads for ranking and 0recommendations next year. From a hiring standpoint, our focus continues to be on\nadding technical talent to support our strategic priorities. In the fourth quarter, nearly 90% of our year-over-year headcount growth was within the R&D function.\nThe remaining growth was primarily in cost of revenue as we added infrastructure headcount to support our data center operations. In 2025, we expect headcount\ngrowth will continue to be primarily driven by technical roles across our priority initiatives within infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, generative AI, as well as\nregulation and compliance. We anticipate headcount growth in our business functions will remain relatively limited. To achieve our ambitions in these areas, we\nwill need to continue executing at a rapid pace. We\u2019re supporting this by building tools to help our engineering base be more productive. As part of our efficiency\nfocus over the past two years, we\u2019ve made significant improvements in our internal processes and developer tools and introduced new tools like our AI-powered\ncoding assistant, which is helping our engineers write code more quickly. Looking forward, we expect that the continuous advancements in Llama\u2019s coding\ncapabilities will provide even greater leverage to our engineers, and we are focused on expanding its capabilities to not only assist our engineers in writing and\nreviewing our code, but also to begin generating code changes to automate tool updates and improve the quality of our code base. Finally, we expect our strong\nfinancial position will enable us to support these investments while continuing to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Moving\nto our financial outlook. We expect first quarter 2025 total revenue to be in the range of $39.5 billion to $41.8 billion. This reflects 8% to 15% year-over-year\ngrowth, or 11% to 18% growth on a constant currency basis as our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 3% headwind to year-over-year total\nrevenue growth, based on current exchange rates. This also reflects the effect of lapping leap day in the first quarter of 2024. While we are not providing a\nfull-year 2025 revenue outlook, we expect the investments we\u2019re making in our core business this year will give us an opportunity to continue delivering strong\nrevenue growth throughout 2025. Turning now to the expense outlook. We expect full-year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $114 billion to $119 billion.\nWe expect the single largest driver of expense growth in 2025 to be infrastructure costs, driven by higher operating expenses and depreciation. We expect\nemployee compensation to be the second-largest factor as we add technical talent in the priority areas that I referenced earlier. Turning now to the CapEx\noutlook. We anticipate our full-year 2025 capital expenditures will be in the range of $60 billion to $65 billion. We expect CapEx growth in 2025 will be driven by\nincreased investment to support both our generative AI efforts and our core business. The majority of our CapEx in 2025 will continue to be directed toward our\ncore business. On to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2025 tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 15%. In addition, we\ncontinue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business\nand our financial results. In closing, this was a good year for our company, with investments across our priority areas delivering strong business performance and\ninnovative new products for our community. We have a compelling set of opportunities to invest in this year, which we expect will help us drive continued strong\ngrowth and develop transformative technologies that shape the future of our company and of the industry. With that, Krista, let\u2019s open up the call for questions.\nOperator\nThank you. Thank you. We will now open the lines for a question-and-answer session.

I think that the quality of this is just -- it's going to keep on\nimproving and improved a lot over the last year. We're also finding more ways that it's useful to integrate it into our services to help more people discover it.

So first of all, we expect that we are continuing to purchase third-party silicon from leading \nproviders in the industry. And we are certainly committed to those long-standing partnerships, but we're also very invested in developing our own custom silicon \nfor unique workloads, where off-the-shelf silicon isn't necessarily optimal and specifically, because we're able to optimize the full stack to achieve greater compute \nefficiency and performance per cost and power because our workloads might require a different mix of memory versus network, bandwidth versus compute and \nso we can optimize that really to the specific needs of our different types of workloads.

I mean on open source, I think the best analogy for us is what we did with open compute, where we weren't first to building the system.

And then a lot of the industry adopted what we were\ndoing, contributed innovations back to it. By standardizing it on it, that meant that a bunch of supply chain standardized on building it, which made prices more\nefficient for everyone. I think what we see here is as Llama becomes more used, it's more likely, for example, that silicon providers and others -- other APIs and\ndeveloper platforms will optimize their work more for that and basically drive down the costs of using it and drive improvements that we can, in some cases, use\ntoo.

So first of all, what I would say is over the long term, we think we have continued opportunity to drive\nrevenue growth across both pricing and impression growth, so both sort of supply and demand dimensions. When we look at pricing, our reported growth can be\ninfluenced by different factors such as supply because of the auction dynamics by the mix shift of the different types of surfaces where ads show up. For example,\nservices like video or lower monetization efficiency, relatively speaking. And then, of course, broader macro factors. But we generally expect that we are going to\nbe able to deliver ongoing ad performance improvements through a lot of the ongoing work that we're doing across our monetization road map and that will have\nthe sort of effect of benefiting pricing overall. And part of what I think is kind of important to think about here when we think about price growth is we really -- the\naverage price per ad as we reported, is really blending, it's an output metric. It's blending a lot of things that are happening, including what our advertiser is\nbidding for, what are their bids for those things? What is the average cost of their actions. So given that there are so many different objectives that advertisers can\noptimize for that have different values, it's a very complex metric that tries to distill that into one thing. Overall, we are seeing healthy cost per action trends for\nadvertisers for whatever is the action that they are optimizing for. And we believe we'll continue to get better at driving conversions for advertisers. And when we\ndo, that will have the effect of continuing to lift CPMs over time, because we're delivering more conversions per impression served, resulting in higher value\nimpressions.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.

I think there's a number of novel things that they did that I think we're still digesting. And there are a number of things that\nthey have advances that we will hope to implement in our systems.

I kind\nof expect that every new company that has an advance -- that has a launch is going to have some new advances that the rest of the field learns from. And that's\nsort of how the technology industry goes. I don't know -- it's probably too early to really have a strong opinion on what this means for the trajectory around\ninfrastructure and CapEx and things like that. There are a bunch of trends that are happening here all at once. There's already sort of a debate around how much\nof the compute infrastructure that we're using is going to go towards pretraining versus as you get more of these reasoning time models or reasoning models\nwhere you get more of the intelligence by putting more of the compute into inference, whether just will mix shift how we use our compute infrastructure towards\nthat. That was already something that I think a lot of the other labs and ourselves were starting to think more about and already seemed pretty likely even before\nthis, that -- like of all the compute that we're using, that the largest pieces aren't necessarily going to go towards pre-training. But that doesn't mean that you need\nless compute, because one of the new properties that's emerged is the ability to apply more compute at inference time in order to generate a higher level of\nintelligence and a higher quality of service, which means that as a company that has a strong business model to support this, I think that's generally an advantage\nthat we're now going to be able to provide a higher quality of service than others, who don't necessarily have the business model to support it on a sustainable\nbasis. The other thing is just that when we're building things like Meta AI, but also how we're implementing AI into all the feeds and ad products and things like\nthat, we're just serving billions of people, which is different from, okay, you start to pretrain a model, and that model is sort of agnostic to how many people are\nusing it, like at some level, it's going to be expensive for us to serve all of these people, because we are serving a lot of people. And so I'm not sure what the kind\nof net effect of all of this is. The field continues to move quickly. There's a lot to learn from releases from basically everyone who does something interesting, not\njust the ones over the last month.

We are in a phase where we are really learning a lot from the way that people\nengage with Meta AI. So from an app perspective, WhatsApp continues to see the strongest Meta AI usage across our family of apps. People there are using it\nmost frequently for information seeking and educational queries along with emotional support use cases. Most of the WhatsApp engagement is in one-on-one\nthreads, though we see some usage in group messaging. And on Facebook, which is the second largest driver of Meta AI engagement, we're seeing strong\nengagement from our feed deep dives integration that lets people ask Meta AI questions about the content that is recommended to that. So across, I would say,\nall query types, we continue to see signs that Meta AI is helping people leverage our apps for new use cases. We talked about information gathering, social\ninteraction and communication. Lots of people use it for humor and casual conversation. They use it for writing and editing research recommendations. And as we\nlook forward to 2025 in our Meta AI road map, we are really focused on doing more to make it feel more personalized. So I would say some of the most exciting\nfeatures we're working on, including improving sort of the memory dimension of the Meta AI experience. We'll be able to remember certain details that people\nshare in one-on-one chats, for example, and use those details to personalize its responses and then really increasing its ability to deliver great content\nrecommendations and enhance really what makes Facebook and Instagram, so valuable for people today.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo.

Could you talk a little bit about the constraints you're seeing or where you're seeing constraints, either internally resources planning or externally\nand any one -- any parts of the ecosystem? And then on the second one, I'm curious, as you think about your needs for hiring and we just think about -- we know\nyou gave the OpEx guide for this year. But as we think about future needs for hiring, could you just give us a sense of how we should think about that? You\nannounced the performance-related reductions earlier this -- for early this year.

I'm happy to take both of those. So on your first question on just where do we see constraints in our ability to execute against our CapEx plans. Obviously,\nwe are staying on top of supply availability. That is certainly one of the factors that will influence our CapEx spend in 2025, but we don't really have any updates\nto share on supply availability right now. We are planning to significantly ramp up deployment of GPUs in 2025, and we'll continue to engage with our vendors\nand invest in our own silicon to meet those needs. When you asked how to think about capital intensity, we're not really -- as both Mark and I alluded to in our\nprior comments, I think it is really too early to determine what long-run capital intensity is going to look like. There are so many different factors. The pace of\nadvancement in underlying models, how efficient can they be? What is the adoption and use case of our Gen AI products, what performance gains come from\nnext-generation hardware innovations, both our own and third-party and then ultimately, what monetization or other efficiency gains our AI investments unlock. So\nagain, I think we are sort of early in the journey here, and we don't have -- I would say we don't have kind of anything to share about long-run capital intensity yet.\nYour second question was about thinking about hiring needs. So it's a good segue after infrastructure, employee compensation is the next largest driver of\nexpense growth in 2025. And here, growth in employee comp and headcount more broadly is primarily driven by those areas that I mentioned, infrastructure\nmonetization, generative AI, Reality Labs and regulation and compliance. And those generally are more technical organizations. That means that it is a higher\ncost base relative to business functions where we are also expecting to keep headcount growth constrained. And I would say we are -- we're focused on running\nthe company efficiently. But at the same time, it is -- we feel like we're in a critical period in terms of making sure that we are investing to win, and we want to\nmake sure that we staff those priority areas in a way that really positions us to best do that.", "char_count": 2177, "word_count": 380, "token_count": 456, "exchange_id": "ex_006", "exchange_role": "answer", "chunk_id": "META_TRANSCRIPT_2024_Q4_u_0021", "company": "META", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2024, "period": "2024-Q4", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/META/META_FY2024_Q4.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

So I guess a couple of things that I'd say on this. One is when you're thinking about agents and reasoning, a lot of this is about being able to perform\nmultistep tasks. So right now, the way that a lot of these systems work as you kind of say something and then it responds and it's almost chat like. But I think that\nthe direction that it's going is you're going to be able to give it an intent or a task and it's going to be able to go off and use sort of an arbitrary amount of compute\nas much as you want to use on it to be able to do a task. Some of the tasks might be pretty simple for people go buy a specific thing. Some of them might be\nreally hard, like go write an app or optimize this code and like really make it as good as possible. And that type of thing, I think, is just going to start becoming\nmore and more prevalent over the next a year or two. So I think it's very exciting. It's sort of we'll feel in some ways like the current products are just getting\nsmarter and others, it will feel like sort of a new form factor, because it won't be as much like chat. But it's sort of another generation of these products. So I think\nit's just in general, there's a lot to build and be excited about. I guess my note of caution or just my kind of periodic reminder on our product development process,\nif you will, is we build these product. We try to scale them to reach usually 1 billion people or more. And it's at that point once they're at scale that we really start\nfocusing on monetization. So sometimes we'll experiment with monetization before, we're running some experiments with Threads now, for example. But we\ntypically don't really ramp these things up or see them as meaningfully contributing to the business until we reach quite a big scale. So the thing that I think is\ngoing to be meaningful this year is the kind of getting of the AI product to scale. Last year was sort of the introduction and starting to get to be used. This year my\nkind of expectation and hope is that we will be at a sufficient scale and have sufficient kind of flywheel of people using it and improvement from that, that this will\nhave a durable advantage. But that doesn't mean that it's going to be a major contributor to the business. This year the improvements of the business are going to\nbe taking the AI methods and applying them to advertising and recommendations and feeds and things like that. So the actual business opportunity for Meta AI\nand AI studio and business agents and people interacting with these AIs remains outside of '25 for the most part. And I think that's an important thing for us to\ncommunicate and for people to internalize as you're thinking about our prospects here. But nonetheless, we've run a process like this many times. We built a\nproduct. We make it good. We scale it to be large. We build out the business around it. That's what we do.
