## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Eric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs)**: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe following up on Brian's question and coming at it from a different angle, and appreciate the color on the use cases
you're seeing today for Meta AI. How would you suspect those use cases evolve with a standalone app? Can you bring us into a little bit the decision process to
do a standalone app, what that might change in terms of utility, frequency, or scale relative to what you see inside Family of Apps today? And how do you think
about positioning Meta AI as a standalone app against the competitive landscape today of other standalone sorts of consumer AI apps? Thank you.

### Exchange 002

**Justin Post (Bank of America)**: Great. Thank you. A couple of questions. Just on the guide in the second quarter, there are reports of potential supply issues in e-commerce. How you thought
about that in the guide, and maybe how you're thinking about it for the back half? And then on a bigger picture question, your CapEx spend is now on close to
some hyperscalers with very big client bases? Just help us conceptualize the kind of ecosystem you're building with your CapEx. I know you gave a lot of help on
the intro, but maybe the ROI works without direct enterprise spend to drive revenues. How you're thinking about that? Thank you.

**Susan Li (CFO)**: Thanks, Justin. On the Q2 guide, there is uncertainty, obviously, and how the macro environment will evolve over time and how that could impact different
segments of our business. Our Q2 revenue outlook aims to factor that in and partly -- that's partly why the $3 billion range reflects the potential for a wider range
of outcomes. Specifically, we have seen some reduced spend in the US from Asia-based e-commerce exporters, which we believe is in anticipation of the de
minimis exemption going away on May 2nd. A portion of that spend has been redirected to other markets, but overall spend for those advertisers is below the
levels prior to April. But our Q2 outlook reflects the trends we're seeing so far in April, which have generally been healthy. So it's very early and hard to know how
things will play out over the quarter, and certainly harder to know that for the rest of the year. Your second question is about why we're investing more in CapEx.
And we really believe that our ability to build world-class infrastructure gives us a meaningful advantage in both developing the leading AI technology and services
over the coming years, and there are a lot of opportunities also for us to improve our core business by putting more compute against our ads and
recommendation work. So even with the capacity that we're bringing online in 2025, we are having a hard time meeting the demand that teams have for compute
resources across the company. So we are going to continually invest meaningfully here across our infrastructure footprint, but we are also really looking to build
this capacity in a way that gives us the maximum flexibility in how and when we deploy it over the coming years. So we can respond to how the market and
technology develop.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

### Exchange 003

**Doug Anmuth (JPMorgan)**: Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to follow up on CapEx and infrastructure spending. Just on the higher range for CapEx, can you just help us
understand how much of that is tied to the additional data center investments versus the increased hardware costs, and really what's driving those higher
hardware costs? And then separately, there have been some articles suggesting that you've been looking to partner to share some of the costs of the AI
infrastructure build-out. Can you just help us understand your thought process there and some of the pros and cons of going alone versus partnering? Thanks.

**Susan Li (CFO)**: Thanks, Doug. So our increased CapEx outlook reflects both of those updates, the increased data center spend this year as we have made some adjustments to
flex our build strategy that will enable us to really stand up capacity more quickly, both in '25 and '26. We haven't broken down sort of the exact drivers. The
higher cost we expect to incur for infrastructure hardware this year really comes from suppliers who source from countries around the world, and there's just a lot
of uncertainty around this given the ongoing trade discussions. And so that is both reflected in the wider range that we are giving, and we're also working on our
end on mitigations by optimizing our supply chain and our outlook is really trying to reflect our best understanding of the potential impact this year across all of
that uncertainty. On the second part of your question, we are -- we are pleased to have partners investing alongside us and bringing Llama to market like AWS
and Azure, who are helping us host Llama. We're always looking for opportunities to continue deepening or expanding those partnerships, but we are funding the
infrastructure that is being used to train Llama, and we don't have any expectation that will change at this point.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Please go ahead.

### Exchange 004

**Mark Shmulik (Bernstein)**: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. Mark, in your conversation last night with Satya, I think you both discussed a bit around kind of the portion of code being
written internally by AI. Kind of back to some of your previous comments around this being a year where we might see AI kind of the place of a mid-level
engineer. With the world evolving so quickly, can you share some places where you've seen strong traction there? And are we progressing kind of faster, slower
as you expected towards this milestone? And then, Susan, with the expense guidance coming down just a touch, how should we think about just the overall
cadence of expected spending, really as it relates to kind of core business performance and just the realities of the day-to-day world we're living in? Thank you.

**Susan Li (CFO)**: On your second question about our lowered expense outlook, really, we are four months into the year the lowered outlook reflects more refined forecasts,
including updated expectations for both employee compensation as well as some other non-headcount-related operating expenses this year. And that's partially
offset by higher expected infrastructure costs related to our increased CapEx outlook as well as higher expected Reality Labs cost of goods sold. And we've
maintained our $5 billion range just given the more dynamic operating environment that we're in. And what I would say is our investment posture today reflects
the significant opportunities that we see across each of the Company and priorities that we're investing in this year. We will obviously continue evaluating
depending on how macro conditions more broadly evolve. But we really feel like these are big strategic priorities for us and are critical for us to continue investing
in. And in fact, I think one of the aims of our efficiency work over the last two years was to put us in a stronger financial position, so that we can continue investing
in key priorities through tougher financial cycles.

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.

### Exchange 005

**Ross Sandler (Barclays)**: Great. Mark, yesterday in one of your many kind of podcast or keynote presentations, you had mentioned that like a bunch of projects that your teams want to or
aspire to do are kind of bottlenecked by the AI capacity, which Susan just talked about earlier, and that even some of the testing that the ad ranking team wants to
run is just getting kind of delayed. So I guess looking out either this year, next year, or whatever, when do you kind of see some of this constraint being eased
back? And more broadly, we're kind of three years past the IDFA impact to your business. So, where do you -- where do you think we are in terms of just the
overall improvements to the ad ranking system, the ROI that you guys are able to deliver, and like what inning are we in on that in your opinion? Thank you very
much.

**Susan Li (CFO)**: I can take a shot at both of those, and Mark, you can obviously chime in. On the first question, the cap -- the capacity landscape we are in is pretty dynamic, both 
in terms of the many moving parts in terms of us bringing capacity online, but also in terms of the demand from different product groups in our company, whether 
they are in the Gen AI teams or whether they're doing more of the core AI work around ranking and recommendation. So both the supply and demand are quite 
fluid and so we don't have a sort of fixed answer in terms of when we expect that we will sort of have enough supply to meet all demand, but that's something that

we are working very hard to alleviate and it's part of why we accelerated bringing more data center space online this year and also we're very focused on
increasing the efficiency of our workloads over the course of the year. On your second question about ads performance ads ranking. We have invested for many
years and continue to invest in driving ad performance improvements. Year-over-year conversion growth remains strong, and in fact, we continue to see
conversions grow at a faster rate than ad impressions in Q1. So, reflecting increased conversion rates. And ads ranking and modeling improvements are a big
driver of overall performance gains. We have a lot of innovations in model architecture in both the ads retrieval and ranking stages of the ads delivery process to
serve more relevant ads to people. We talked about the introduction of the new GEM ads recommendation model in Q1, and we have talked about some of the
prior model architecture improvements like Lattice and Andromeda in past quarters. For us, we really believe first and foremost that advertising is a relative
performance game, and that's especially important for us, because the vast majority of our business is direct response advertising. So we feel good about how
the prior investments are paying off, and we continue to invest in a lot of different work to constantly improve our ads ranking and recommendations performance.

Your next question comes from the line of Kenneth Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

### Exchange 006

**Kenneth Gawrelski (Wells Fargo)**: Thank you so much. Two for me, please. First, maybe, Mark. How should we think about the timing of AI capabilities necessary to drive WhatsApp for business
adoption in higher cost -- higher labor cost labor markets? What is Meta doing to accelerate that adoption? And do you see this as mostly incremental to SME ad
spend that you're already capturing? And then first, Susan, one, please. What does the revised CapEx outlook for this year for '25 mean about future years? Does
it mean anything, or you talked about this being an acceleration in your revised outlook statement. Should we think about this as a new starting point for -- to think
about '26 and beyond? Or should we just start fresh in '26 and think about the needs and capacity at that point? Thank you.

**Susan Li (CFO)**: I'm happy to take -- I'll go ahead and take both of those, and Mark, you should feel free to chime in wherever you would like. So Mark talked a little bit about our
general vision that every business will soon have an AI that is an expert on their business for their customers to talk to in the same way that today they've got
email and websites, social media presences, et cetera. We are currently testing business AIs with a limited set of businesses in the U.S. and a few additional
countries on WhatsApp, Messenger, and on -- ads on Facebook and Instagram. We've been starting with small businesses and focusing first on helping them sell
their goods and services with business AIs. But ultimately, we are working on tools to support businesses at every stage of the customer funnel, from lead
generation to order management and customer service, and a core area that we're addressing right now is really the ability for businesses to customize and
control the agent to achieve the outcome that they want. So we've launched a new agent management experience and dashboard that makes it easier for
businesses to train their AI based on existing information on their website or WhatsApp profile, or their Instagram and Facebook pages, and we're starting with
the ability for businesses to activate AI in their chats with customers. We are also testing business AIs on Facebook and Instagram ads that you can ask about
product and return policies, or assist you in making a purchase within our in-app browser. So again, the ultimate vision is to build an experience that serves
customers across all of these different services and apps. No matter where you engage with the business AI, it should be one agent that recalls your history and
your preferences and we're hearing encouraging feedback is particularly that adopting these AIs are saving the businesses that we're testing with a lot of time and
helping to determine which conversations make sense for them to spend more time on. And then your second question right was about 2026 CapEx. You know,
infrastructure, as I alluded to earlier, just is a very dynamic planning area given the continued advances in AI, and also for us, the fact that we continue to find a
lot of good use cases to put capacity toward in our core AI ranking and recommendations work. So I would say it's too early to discuss plans beyond 2025.

Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.

### Exchange 007

**Mark Mahaney (Evercore)**: Thanks. I'll just throw in two. I think you called out the China-based retailers as one sort of potentially soft advertising vertical. Anything else you'd call out? And I
would just suggest autos, is that an area of any softness? And then on the Reality Labs and on the losses associated with Reality Labs, they've been very
consistent, whatever, $4 billion a quarter for quite some time. Is there -- is there light at the end of the tunnel? Is there a reason to think? Is there a factor that
would occur that would cause those losses to come down? And when would that be, but maybe more importantly, what is going to cause those losses to come
down? Thank you very much.

**Susan Li (CFO)**: Mark, let me take your first question about other verticals. We generally saw healthy growth in most verticals in Q1. We did see some weakness in gaming and
politics. So, year-over-year growth in gaming was negative in Q1, as we lapped a period of strong spend from China-based advertisers that were promoting a
larger volume of game titles in Q1 of 2024. And then year-over-year growth in the government and politics vertical dropped sharply as expected with the
conclusion of U.S. elections and but that continues to just be a very small vertical overall. And then your second question on Reality Labs. Yes.
