## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Brian Nowak (Morgan Stanley)**: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. One for Mark and one for Susan. Mark, I wanted to sort of ask you about Meta AI a little bit. Can you help us
understand some of the more recurring types of interactions or query types you're seeing with this product and whether they have commercial intent? And then
just over time, how do you think about building your own in-house search offering as opposed to partnering and having another player partner those queries? And
then, Susan, I wanted to ask you about sort of headcount because you talked a lot about sort of infrastructure investment into ‘25. How do we sort of think about
relative headcount investments into ‘25 to sort of support all that infrastructure versus what you've been doing in 2024? Thanks.

**Susan Li (CFO)**: Brian, thanks for the question. This is Susan. So your first question was around what kinds of recurring interactions that we see between people and their usage
of Meta AI. And we're seeing first of all, I think, as Mark mentioned, just we're excited about the progress of Meta AI. It's obviously very early in its journey, but it
continues to be on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by end of year, and it has over 500 million monthly actives. And people are using it for many
things. A number of the frequent use cases we're seeing include information gathering help with how-to tasks, which is the largest use case. But we also see
people using it to go deeper on interest, to look for content on our services, for image generation. That's also been another pretty popular use case so far. And I
would say that in the near term, our focus is really on making Meta AI increasingly valuable for people. And if we're successful, we think there will be a
broadening set of queries that people use it for, including more monetizable queries over time. The second part of your question Meta AI draws from content
across the web to address timely questions from users and it provides sources for those results from our search engine partners. We've integrated with Bing and
Google, both of whom offer great search experiences. Like other companies, we also train our Gen AI models on content that is publicly available online and we
crawl the web for a variety of purposes. Your second question was really, I think, around maybe how we're thinking about headcount in 2025. And we are still
working through our budgeting processes for ‘25. That's in part why we changed our forward-looking guidance approach to give guidance in the next call. But as
we're working through this, we are looking at where there are opportunities for us to invest in our strategic priorities, and that includes monetization, infrastructure,

### Exchange 002

**Eric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs)**: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just one building on that question from Brian and going back to Mark's comments about the learnings as you do
go through the business planning process. Mark, I wanted to understand better what you continue to learn about what the biggest opportunity sets are to apply AI
to when you think about your platform, your product portfolio, and your internal processes because you sound quite optimistic about key learnings and how they
continue to ramp and maybe even accelerate in terms of the potential for return profile. I just want to go a little bit deeper into what your key learnings are as you
go through that process. Thank you.

### Exchange 003

**Douglas Anmuth (JPMorgan)**: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to follow up first on Meta AI, Mark, helpful context for me to understand how people are using the platform
today, maybe you can just talk more about some of that functionality over time as agents are introduced, just how you really expect to use cases to expand
beyond just longer and more complex queries. And then, Susan, on CapEx, just trying to understand your comment on 4Q a little bit more, it sounds like some of
the payments pushed into 4Q with the guidance suggesting $15 billion to $17 billion in CapEx in the quarter. And is that something we should think about as run
rate into 2025? Thank you.

**Susan Li (CFO)**: Thanks Doug. So your second question was about Q4 CapEx. The expected step up in Q4 CapEx from Q3 is that part of that comes from increases in server
spend and to a lesser extent data center CapEx, but with servers, there are these timing dynamics at play that you referred to because we had these server
deliveries that landed late in Q3, and so the cash doesn't go out the door basically till Q4, and that's when you'll see the CapEx show up. And given the nature of
capital expenditures generally, there is some actually quite a bit of lumpiness quarter-to-quarter. So it's a little bit hard to sort of extrapolate from any particular
quarter. Overall, I'd say we're growing our infrastructure investments significantly this year, and we expect significant growth again in 2025.

Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.

### Exchange 004

**Justin Post (Bank of America)**: Great. I think I'll ask a cost question this time. Just thinking about use of AI and employee productivity, how are you able to utilize AI internally, and are you seeing
big productivity gains in your R&D group? And second, I know I'll go after the headcount one more time, but Susan, how flexible is your headcount as you think
about cost growth in other areas? Thanks.

**Susan Li (CFO)**: Justin, so I'll take a crack at both of those. On the use of AI and employee productivity, it's certainly something that we're very excited about. I don't know that we 
have anything particularly quantitative that we're sharing right now. I think there are different efficiency opportunities with AI that we've been focused on in terms 
of where we can reduce costs over time and generate savings through increasing internal productivity in areas like coding for example, it's early, but we're seeing 
a lot of adoption internally of our internal assistant and coding agent. And we continue to make Llama more effective at coding, which should also make this use 
case increasingly valuable to developers over time. There are also places where we hope over time that we'll be able to deploy these tools against a lot of our 
content moderation efforts to help make the big body of content moderation work that we undertake to help it make it more efficient and effective for us to do so. 
And there are lots of other places around the company where I would say we're relatively early in exploring the way that we can use LLM-based tools to make 
different types of work streams more efficient. So all that is to say it's something we're pretty excited about. We have lots of teams focused on it. There are sort of 
small opportunities and G&A functions to what we hope will be big opportunities in areas like content moderation and coding productivity over time. On your 
second question about headcount, we're really, again, we're still mid-budget, so there's, we don't have very much that is definitive to share about this at the time. 
But as we're evaluating where there are opportunities for us to make good investments, we really think about there is a bucket of very ROI-driven headcount 
opportunities. We're very rigorous about the way we think about returns there and what the return opportunity is and what we think is the likelihood of those 
returns and what is the aggregate incrementality of those investments. And those are all things that sort of we're evaluating when we think about where to invest 
in the core business and where we think we can deliver sort of ROI on a near-term basis. And then at the same time, we're also assessing what the opportunities 
look like, again, some of the more medium and long-term strategic areas of investment. And that includes our efforts in Gen AI and the infrastructure needed to 
support it and includes our investments in Reality Labs. And so those are all things that we're kind of assessing in kind of a portfolio of what we think we would do 
in 2025. With a couple of thoughts, one is, again, where can we sort of build the most flexibility into the way that we're thinking about either infrastructure or

headcount plans. And the second is we're really focused across the company on our efficiency efforts broadly and making sure that we feel like we're continuing
to push the whole company, including areas in which we expect that we will be making additional headcount investments to think about how they can be more
efficient in 2025 than they were in 2024.

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.

### Exchange 005

**Ross Sandler (Barclays)**: Great. Just two quick ones, Mark. You said something along the lines of the more standardized Llama becomes, the more improvements will flow back to the core
Meta business. And I guess, could you dig in a little bit more on that? So the series of Llama models are being used by lots of developers building different things
in AI. I guess, how are you using that vantage point to incubate new ideas inside Meta? And then second question is, you mentioned on one of the podcasts after
the Meta Connect that assuming scaling laws hold up, we may need hundreds of billions of compute CapEx to kind of reach our goals around Gen AI. So I guess
how quickly could you conceivably stand up that much infrastructure given some of the constraints around energy or custom ASICs or other factors? Is there any
more color on the speed by which we could get that amount of compute online at Meta? Thank you.

**Susan Li (CFO)**: Thanks, Ron. So your first question was about Threads. We're making good progress there. We are continuing to launch more features and make improvements
to our ranking stack. We feel very good about the continued user growth on Threads. We're bringing on an increasing number of users each quarter and depth of
engagement also continues to grow and in Q3, we saw especially strong user growth in key markets like the US, Taiwan, and Japan and we've added a number
of new features over the course of Q3 including, account insights for businesses and creators to see how their posts perform, the ability to save multiple drafts,
continuing to deliver on our commitment to integrate Threads with the Fediverse and basically we're very focused on continuing to build out the sort of
functionality of Threads over time and being responsive to what users tell us that they're interested in. Specifically, as it pertains to monetization, we don't expect
Threads to be a meaningful driver of 2025 revenue at this time. We've been just pleased with the growth trajectory and, again, are really focused on introducing
features that the community finds valuable in working to deepen growth and engagement. Your second question was about the increase in average price per ad,
so that grew 11% year-over-year driven by strong advertiser demand and part of that is because of better ad performance over time also and we saw that CPM
growth accelerate slightly from 10% in Q2 in part because we experienced lower impression growth in Q3, but more broadly as we think about price and growth
and this metric, the year-over-year growth in reported price per ad, there's a lot that goes into that including the auction dynamics resulting from fluctuations and
impression growth. And one of the things that we feel like we're very focused on is really the input metrics. What are the conversions that we are delivering to
advertisers? Are they getting more value over time? The sort of blended reported price per ad is complicated because all of those things get rolled up into it.
There are so many different objectives that advertisers are optimizing for. Those objectives have very different values that make them hard to compare on an
apples to apples basis. But we care a lot about conversion growth, which is growing, continues to grow faster than impression growth. And are we seeing healthy
cost per action or cost per conversion trends, which we are. And as long as we continue to get better at driving conversions for advertisers, that should have the
effect of lifting CPMs over time because we're delivering more conversions for impressions served and that will result in higher value impressions.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo.

### Exchange 006

**Ken Gawrelski (Wells Fargo)**: Thanks for the opportunity. I appreciate that. I have a bigger picture, kind of like ecosystem question here is, when we think, I'm curious, how far do you think we
are from seeing a proliferation of third-party AI applications, specifically on the kind of the consumer side? I know we're seeing more and more on the enterprise
side, agents, et cetera. But when do we see, how far out until we see a proliferation of consumer applications in the AI space? And how do you think about, and
how does Meta think of itself as one of those key, it was one of those key application applications in the mobile internet and the desktop internet. But now you're
also seemingly an infrastructure player as well. So I'd love to hear your thoughts there. Thank you.

**Susan Li (CFO)**: I'm happy to take both of these, Youssef, so your first question was on plans to provide ads on commercial queries. I think I alluded to this maybe in a much
earlier question. Right now, we're really focused on making Meta AI as engaging and valuable a consumer experience as possible. Over time we think there will
be a broadening set of queries that people use it for, and I think that the monetization opportunities will exist when over time as we get there. But right now, I
would say we are really focused on the consumer experience above all, and it's just sort of a playbook for us with products that we put out in the world where we
really dial in the consumer experience before we focus on what the monetization could look like. The second part of your question is about Reality Labs. We
aren't sharing expectations beyond 2024 at this point. And we are certainly as we think about the 2025 budgeting process for Reality Labs, we're certainly thinking
about where we want to make sure we're putting our sort of focus and energy. We are very excited again about the progress that we've seen with our smart
glasses as well as the sort of strong consumer interest in them. And so we're kind of thinking about where we want to make sure that we are investing
appropriately behind the consumer momentum that we see. Overall, I'd say Reality Labs is clearly one of our strategic long-term priorities and we expect it will be
an area of significant investment as we build out towards the very ambitious product roadmap that we have there.

Your last question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.

### Exchange 007

**Mark Mahaney (Evercore)**: Let me throw out two questions, please. One, this is a year in which we've had a lot of unusual events that could be driving ad revenue, major elections in not just
the U.S. but Europe and in India and major sports events like World Cup and then there's some other things. Is there any, just in thinking about comps for next
year and maybe in the future, anything, Susan, you would call out, like, how much of an impact there may have come from these one in every four or five year
events. And then secondly, could you just talk a little bit more about WhatsApp monetization and where you are with that now? It sounds like that's the business
messaging part; it's really feeding it nicely into other revenue. But help us think about where the monetization levels of WhatsApp are now versus where they can
be two or three years down the road, how far away we are from optimization. Thank you.

**Susan Li (CFO)**: Thanks, Mark. So your first question was about sort of the revenue backdrop in 2024. You mentioned events that occur once every four or five years, so I imagine 
we're talking about the Olympics. We historically have not seen meaningful incremental contribution from events like the Olympics. We believe that was largely 
the case this year. So when we think about the Q4 outlook and when we think about going into next year, we generally expect growth to continue to benefit from

the healthy global advertising demand that we've seen. We think that our investments in improving our ads performance will continue to accrue benefits to
advertisers. But obviously there's a big range of possible macro backdrops and that's something that we try to reflect in the range of revenue guidance that we
give. But I don't know that there are a lot of specific events that we would say had a material sort of idiosyncratic to 2024 type of revenue impact. Your second
question was around WhatsApp monetization and where we are. And right now what I would say again is click to message is really the big focus area for us here.
We're seeing continued traction in this area. And in particular growth and click-to-WhatsApp ads remain particularly strong. And so we're continuing to focus both
on scaling click-to-WhatsApp ads in more markets where WhatsApp has strong user adoption like Brazil for example. It's obviously earlier in the US but we're
seeing good growth in click-to-WhatsApp ads and are continuing to invest in scaling in consumer adoption of WhatsApp in the US also which will create bigger
opportunities down the line. So, and then of course a lot of work that we're doing to make the click to messaging ads more effective and helping to focus for the
particular, helping advertisers optimize sorry for the particular conversion events that they care about. The other element of revenue on WhatsApp, I would say, is
paid messaging that continues to grow at a strong pace again. This quarter remains, in fact, the primary driver of growth in our Family of Apps, other revenue line,
which was up 48% in Q3, and we're seeing generally a strong increase in the volume of paid conversations driven both by growth in the number of businesses
adopting paid messaging, as well as in the conversational volume per business.
