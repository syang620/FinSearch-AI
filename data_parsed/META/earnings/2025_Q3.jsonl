Thanks, Ken. Thanks, everyone, for joining today. We had another strong quarter with 3.5 billion people using at least one of our apps every day.\nInstagram had a major milestone with 3 billion monthly actives, and we're seeing good momentum across our other apps as well, including Threads which\nrecently passed 150 million daily actives and remains on track to become the leader in its category. I am very focused on establishing Meta as the leading frontier\nAI lab. Building personal superintelligence for everyone and delivering the app experiences and computing devices that will improve the lives of billions of people\naround the world. Our approach of advancing open source AI means that when Meta innovates, everyone benefits. Meta Superintelligence Labs is off to a strong\nstart. I think that we've already built the lab with the highest talent density in the industry. We're heads down developing our next generation of models and\nproducts and I'm looking forward to sharing more on that front over the coming months. We're also building what we expect to be an industry-leading amount of\ncompute. Now there's a range of time lines for when people think that we're going to get superintelligence. Some people think that we'll get there in a few years.\nOthers think it will be 5, 7 years or longer. I think that it's the right strategy to aggressively frontload building capacity so that way we're prepared for the most\noptimistic cases. That way, if superintelligence arrives sooner, we will be ideally positioned for a generational paradigm shift in many large opportunities. If it takes\nlonger, then we'll use the extra compute to accelerate our core business which continues to be able to profitably use much more compute than we've been able to\nthrow at it. And we're seeing very high demand for additional compute, both internally and externally. And in the worst case, we were just slow building new\ninfrastructure for some period while we grow into what we build. The upside is extremely high for both our existing apps and new products and businesses that\nare becoming possible to build. Across Facebook, Instagram and Threads, our AI recommendation systems are delivering higher quality and more relevant\ncontent, which led to 5% more time spent on Facebook in Q3 and 10% on Threads. Video is a particular bright spot with video time spent on Instagram up more\nthan 30% since last year. And as video continues to grow across our apps, Reels now has an annual run rate of over $50 billion. Improvements in our\nrecommendation systems will also become even more leveraged as the volume of AI-created content grows. Social media has gone through 2 eras so far. First\nwas when all content was from friends, family and accounts that you followed directly. The second was when we added all of the creator content. Now as AI\nmakes it easier to create and remix content, we're going to add yet another huge corpus of content on top of those. Recommendation systems that understand all\nthis content more deeply and can show you the right content to help you achieve your goals are going to be increasingly valuable. Our ads business continues to\nperform very well, largely due to improvements in our AI ranking systems as well. This quarter, we saw meaningful advances from unifying different models into\nsimpler, more general models, which drive both better performance and efficiency. And now the annual run rate going through our completely end-to-end\nAI-powered ad tools has passed $60 billion. And one way that I think about our company overall is that there are 3 giant transformers that run Facebook,\nInstagram and ads recommendations. We have a very strong pipeline of lots of ways to improve these models by incorporating new AI advances and capabilities.\nAnd at the same time, we are also working on combining these 3 major AI systems into a single unified AI system that will effectively run our family of apps and\nbusiness using increasing intelligence to improve the trillions of recommendations that we'll make for people every day. I'm also very excited about the new\nproducts that we're going to be able to build. More than 1 billion monthly actives already use Meta AI and we see usage increase as we improve our underlying\nmodels. I'm very excited to get a frontier model into Meta AI and I think that the opportunity there is very large. The same goes for our business AI. Every day,\npeople have more than 1 billion active threads with business accounts across our messaging platforms, ranging from product questions to customer support. Our\nbusiness AIs will enable tens of millions of businesses to scale these conversations and improve their sales at low cost and the better our models get, the better\nthis is going to work for all businesses. This quarter, we also launched Vibes which is the next generation of our AI creation tools and content experiences.\nRetention is looking good so far. And its usage keeps growing quickly week over week. I'm looking forward to ramping up the growth of Vibes over the coming\nmonths. More broadly, I think that Vibes is an example of a new content type enabled by AI, and I think that there are more opportunities to build many more\nnovel types of content ahead as well. As our new models become ready, I'm looking forward to starting to show everyone some of the new kinds of products that\nwe're working on. At Connect, we announced our 2025 line of AI glasses, and the response so far has been great. The new Ray-Ban Meta glasses and Oakley\nMeta Vanguards are both selling well. As people love the improved battery life, camera resolution, new AI capabilities and the great design. And there's our new\nMeta Ray-Ban display glasses, our first glasses with a high-resolution display and the metaneural band to interact with them. They sold out in almost every store\nwithin 48 hours with demo slots fully booked through the end of next month. So we're going to have to invest in increasing manufacturing and selling more of\nthose. This is an area where we are clearly leading and have a huge opportunity ahead. Taking a step back, if we deliver even a fraction of the opportunity ahead\nfor our existing apps and the new experiences that are possible, then I think that the next few years will be the most exciting period in our history. We've got a lot\nto do. But we're making real progress, delivering strong business results, building the talent density and infrastructure needed for the next era and leading the\nway on AI devices that will define the next computing platform. I am proud of how our teams are rising to the challenge, and I'm grateful for their dedication, hard\nwork and creativity. As always, thank you all for being a part of this journey with us.

{"doc_id": "META_2025_Q3", "ticker": "META", "year": 2025, "quarter": 3, "filing_date": "2025-09-01", "phase": "prepared_remarks", "speaker_name": "Susan Li", "speaker_role": "Unknown", "speaker_firm": null, "utterance_id": "u_0002", "utterance_type": "statement", "text": "Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our segment results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Our \ncommunity across the family of apps continues to grow, and we estimate more than 3.5 billion people used at least 1 of our family of apps on a daily basis in\n\nSeptember. Q3 total family of apps revenue was $50.8 billion, up 26% year-over-year. Q3 family of apps ad revenue was $50.1 billion, up 26% or 25% on a \nconstant currency basis. In Q3, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 14%. Impression growth was healthy across all regions \ndriven by engagement and user growth, particularly on video services. The average price per ad increased 10% year-over-year, benefiting from increased \nadvertiser demand, largely driven by improved ad performance. This was partially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower monetizing regions and \nservices. Family of Apps other revenue was $690 million, up 59%, driven by WhatsApp paid messaging revenue growth as well as meta verified subscriptions. \nWithin our Reality Labs segment, Q3 revenue was $470 million, up 74% year-over-year. The significant year-over-year growth in Q3 was partly due to retail \npartners stocking up on Quest headsets ahead of the holiday season. We did not have a similar benefit in the third quarter of last year since our Quest 3S \nheadset launched in the fourth quarter of 2024. Aside from this, strong AI glasses revenue also contributed to revenue growth in Q3. Moving now to our \nconsolidated results. Q3 total revenue was $51.2 billion, up 26% or 25% on a constant currency basis. Q3 total expenses were $30.7 billion, up 32% compared to \nlast year. Year-over-year expense growth accelerated 20 percentage points from Q2 due primarily to 3 factors: First, legal-related expense growth was higher \nthan in Q2 due to charges we recorded in the third quarter as well as us lapping a period of accrual reversals in the third quarter a year ago. Second, employee \ncompensation growth accelerated, driven by technical hires, particularly AI talent. Finally, growth in infrastructure costs accelerated due to increased \ninfrastructure operating costs associated with our expanded data center fleet, depreciation on our incremental CapEx spend and third-party cloud spend. We \nended Q3 with over 78,400 employees, up 8% year-over-year, driven by hiring in priority areas of monetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, Meta \nSuperintelligence Labs as well as regulation and compliance. Third quarter operating income was $20.5 billion, representing a 40% operating margin. Q3 interest \nand other income was $1.1 billion driven primarily by unrealized gains on our marketable equity securities. Our tax rate for the quarter was 87%, which was \nunfavorably impacted by a onetime noncash reduction in deferred tax assets that we no longer anticipate using under new U.S. tax law. Our tax rate would have \nbeen 14%, excluding this charge. Although the transition to the new U.S. tax law resulted in an accounting charge in the third quarter, we continue to expect we \nwill recognize significant cash tax savings for the remainder of the current year and future years under the new law, and this quarter's charge reflects the total \nexpected impact from the transition to the new U.S. tax law. Net income was $2.7 billion or $1.05 per share. Excluding the onetime tax charge, our net income \nand EPS would have been $18.6 billion and $7.25 per share, respectively. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases were $19.4 \nbillion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $10.6 billion. We repurchased $3.2 billion of our Class A \ncommon stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders. We ended the quarter with $44.4 billion in cash and marketable securities and $28.8 billion in \ndebt. Turning now to the business outlook. There are 2 primary factors that drive our revenue performance. Our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our \ncommunity and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, daily actives continue to grow year-over-year across Facebook, \nInstagram and WhatsApp. We're continuing to see improvements to our products and recommendations drive incremental engagement with year-over-year \ngrowth in global time spent accelerating on both Facebook and Instagram in Q3. In the U.S., overall time spent on Facebook and Instagram grew double digits \nyear-over-year, driven by continued video strength as well as healthy growth in non-video time on Facebook. The engagement gains continue to be driven by \nproduct work and ongoing improvements to our recommendation systems as we optimize our model architectures, implement advanced modeling techniques and \nintegrate more signals about people's interests. We also continue to focus on increasing the freshness of recommended content. On Facebook, our systems are \nnow surfacing twice as many Reels published that day than at the start of the year. Looking to 2026, we expect to advance our recommendation systems across \nseveral dimensions. On Instagram, one focus is evolving our systems to surface content across a broader set of topics that cater to the diverse interest of each \nperson. This follows a similar approach we've implemented on Facebook that has driven good results. We also expect to make significant progress on our \nlonger-term ranking innovations in 2026. We're seeing promising new results from our research efforts to create foundational ranking models and expect the new \nmodel innovations we're developing as part of this will enable us to significantly scale up the amount of data and compute we use to train our recommendation \nmodels in 2026, yielding more relevant recommendations. Another large focus next year is leveraging LLMs to improve content understanding. We expect this is \ngoing to enable our systems to more precisely label the keywords and topics within videos and posts, which will allow our systems to both develop deeper \nintuition about a person's interest and retrieve the content that matches them. Finally, we're making good progress with Meta AI and Threads. The number of \npeople using Meta AI across our family of apps continues to grow, and we're increasingly leveraging first-party content into Meta AI results with the majority of \nMeta AI's responses to Facebook Deep Dive queries in the U.S. now showing related Reels. We're also seeing a lot of traction with media generation. People \nhave created over 20 billion images using our products. And since launching Vibes within Meta AI in September, we have seen media generation in the app \nincreased more than tenfold. On Threads, we see strong growth in both daily actives and the depth of engagement as we continue to improve recommendations. \nThe ranking optimizations we made in Q3 alone drove a 10% increase in time spent on Threads. We also continue to ship new features, including launching \ndirect messaging in Q3, so anyone on Threads can now message one another within the app. Now to the second driver of our revenue performance. increasing \nmonetization efficiency. The first part of this work is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. We continue to refine ad supply across each of our \nmajor surfaces within Facebook and Instagram to better deliver ads at the time and place they are most relevant to people. Longer term, we have exciting ad \nsupply opportunities on both Threads and WhatsApp status. Ads are now running globally and feed on Threads and we're following our typical monetization \nplaybook of optimizing the ads formats and performance before we ramp supply. Within WhatsApp status, we're continuing to gradually introduce ads and expect \nto complete the rollout next year. The second part of increasing monetization efficiency is improving marketing performance. Advancing our ad systems remains a \ncritical aspect of this work and we are driving performance gains through ongoing improvements in our larger scale ads ranking models. For example, we \ncontinue to broaden the adoption of Lattice, our unified model architecture. In Q3, we rolled out Lattice to app ads, which drove a nearly 3% gain in conversions \nfor that objective. Since introducing Lattice back in 2023, along with other back-end improvements, we have now cut the number of ads ranking and \nrecommendation models by approximately 100 as we consolidated smaller and more specialized models into larger ones that use the Lattice architecture to \ngeneralize learnings across surfaces and objectives. We continue to observe performance improvements as we combine models and expect to drive additional \ngains as we consolidate another 200 models over the coming years into a smaller number of highly capable models. In addition to advancing our foundational ads \nmodels, we're innovating on our run time models we use downstream of them for ads inference. For example, we began piloting a new run time ads ranking \nmodel in Q3 that leverages more compute and data than our prior models to select more relevant ads. In testing, we've seen this new model drive a more than \n2% lift in conversions on Instagram. We also significantly improved performance of Andromeda in Q3 by combining models across retrieval and early-stage \nranking into a single model, driving a 14% increase in ads quality on Facebook surfaces. Within our ads products, we're seeing continued momentum with \nAdvantage+. In Q3, we completed the rollout of our streamlined campaign creation flow for Advantage+ lead campaigns. So now advertisers running sales app or \nlead campaigns have end-to-end automation turned on from the beginning, allowing our systems to look across our platform to optimize performance by \nautomatically choosing criteria like who to show the ads to and where to show them. The annual run rate of revenue running through our end-to-end automated \nsolutions has now reached $60 billion following the implementation of the new streamlined creation flow, as we continue to see more advertisers leverage the \nperformance benefits of our solutions. Within our Advantage+ creative suite, the number of advertisers using at least 1 of our video generation features was up \n20% versus the prior quarter as adoption of image animation and video expansion continues to scale. We've also added more generative AI features to make it \neasier for advertisers to optimize their ad creatives and drive increased performance. In Q3, we introduced AI generated music. So advertisers can have music \ngenerated for their ad that aligns with the tone and message of the creative. Finally, business messaging remains a significant opportunity for us. We're seeing \nstrong growth across our portfolio of solutions, including with click-to-WhatsApp ads, which grew revenue 60% year-over-year in Q3. We're also making good \nprogress on our business AI efforts, where we've been focused on building a turnkey AI that helps businesses generate leads and drive sales. We've been\n\nopening access in recent months to more businesses within our initial test markets, the Philippines and Mexico. And I've seen strong usage with millions of\nconversations between people and business AIs taking place since July. This month, we expanded availability within WhatsApp and Messenger to all eligible\nbusinesses in Mexico and the Philippines, respectively. In the U.S., we're also starting to roll out the ability for merchants to add their business AIs to their website\nso we can support the full sale funnel from ad to purchase. Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. Our primary focus is deploying capital\nto support the company's highest order priorities including developing leading AI products models and business solutions. As we make significant investments in\ninfrastructure to support this work, we are focused on preserving maximum long-term flexibility to ensure we can meet our future capacity needs while also being\nable to respond to how the market develops in the years ahead. We're doing so in several ways, including staging data center sites so we can spring up capacity\nquickly in future years as we need it as well as establishing strategic partnerships that give us option value for future compute needs. The strong financial position\nand cash generation of our business enable us to make these investments while also accessing additional pools of cost-efficient capital. Moving to our financial\noutlook. We expect fourth quarter 2025 total revenue to be in the range of $56 billion to $59 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately\n1% tailwind to year-over-year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates. Our outlook reflects an expectation for continued strong ad revenue growth\npartially offset by lower year-over-year Reality Labs revenue in Q4. The anticipated reduction in Reality Labs revenue is due to us lapping the introduction of\nQuest 3S in Q4 of last year. As well as retail partners procuring Quest headsets during Q3 of this year to prepare for the holiday season, which were recorded as\nrevenue in the third quarter. Turning to the expense and CapEx outlooks. I'll first start with 2025 before providing some commentary on our planning for 2026. We\nexpect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $116 billion to $118 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $114 billion to $118 billion and reflecting a\ngrowth rate of 22% to 24% year-over-year. We currently expect 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases to be in the range of\n$70 billion to $72 billion, increased from our prior outlook of $66 billion to $72 billion. On to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape we expect our fourth\nquarter 2025 tax rate to be 12% to 15%. Turning now to 2026. We are at an exciting point for our company. where we have continued runway to improve our core\nservices today as well as the opportunity to build new AI-powered experiences and services that will transform how people engage with our products in the future.\nWe expect the set of investments we're making within our ads and organic engagement initiatives next year will enable us to continue to deliver strong revenue\ngrowth in 2026. While our progress on AI models and products will position us to capitalize on new revenue opportunities in the years to come. A central\nrequirement to realizing these opportunities is infrastructure capacity. As we have begun to plan for next year, it's become clear that our compute needs have\ncontinued to expand meaningfully, including versus our own expectations last quarter. We are still working through our capacity plans for next year, but we expect\nto invest aggressively to meet these needs, both by building our own infrastructure and contracting with third-party cloud providers. We anticipate this will provide\nfurther upward pressure on our CapEx and expense plans next year. As a result, our current expectation is that CapEx dollar growth will be notably larger in 2026\nthan 2025. We also anticipate total expenses will grow at a significantly faster percentage rate a than 2025, with growth primarily driven by infrastructure costs,\nincluding incremental cloud expenses and depreciation. Employee compensation costs will be the second largest contributor to growth. As we recognize a full\nyear of compensation for employees hired throughout 2025, particularly AI talent and add technical talent in priority areas. Finally, we continue to monitor active\nlegal and regulatory matters, including the increasing headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and financial results. For\nexample, in the EU, we continue to engage constructively with the European Commission on our less personalized ads offering. However, we cannot rule out the\ncommission imposing further changes to that offering that could have a significant negative impact on our European revenue as early as this quarter. In the U.S.,\na number of youth-related trials are scheduled for 2026 and may ultimately result in a material loss. In closing, this was another good quarter for our business. We\nhave an exciting set of opportunities to continue improving our core business while delivering innovative new experiences and services for the people and\nbusinesses using our products in the years to come. With that, Christa, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.", "char_count": 16645, "word_count": 2644, "token_count": 3352, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

I think your first question had a couple of parts to it. So I'm going to try to disaggregate those parts, and let me know if this\naddresses what you're getting to. I will say that the growth in 2026 CapEx relative to 2025 comes from growth in each of the core areas, MSL, core AI as well as\nnon-AI spend. So all of those areas are growing, but the MSL AI needs are growing the most. In terms of the core AI pipeline, I think, we talked about last year\nwhen we were going into the 2025 budget process, we had a road map of resource investments across both head count and compute that we thought would pay\noff in 2026. And it's really a very broad range of sort of different ads ranking and performance efforts. And we're continuing to see that those have paid off through\nthe course of the year. There is a long list of specific efforts, but 1 of the measures that we look at to monitor this is how are we driving ad performance, how are\nconversions growing? Conversions is a complex metric for us because advertisers optimize for so many different conversions on different values. But when we\ncontrol for that and look at value-weighted conversion rates, we're seeing very strong year-over-year growth and conversion -- weighted conversions continue to\ngrow faster than impressions. We also talked about some of the new model architecture over the course of the year and the degree to which the new model\narchitecture is enabling us also to take advantage of having more data and more compute to drive ads performance. So we expect that, that's going to be a\ncontinued story in 2026. We are, in fact, at the beginning of our 2026 budgeting process now, and we see a similar list of revenue investments that we're excited\nto be able to invest in. And so we think that, that's going to be a big part of our ability to continue to drive strong revenue performance throughout the year. On\nyour second question, which is the Reality Labs revenue headwind. I don't think we have quantified the exact size of that. We expect that Q4 Reality Labs\nrevenue will be lower than last year for a couple of reasons that I alluded to, the biggest factor is we're lapping the introduction of Quest 3S in Q4 of last year, and\nwe don't have a new headset in the market this year. We also recorded all of our holiday-related Quest 3S sales in Q4 '24, since the headset was launched in\nOctober '24. This year, we're recognizing some of those Quest 3S sales in Q3 as retail partners have procured Quest headsets in advance of the holiday season.\nWe're still expecting significant year-over-year growth in AI Glasses revenue in Q4 as we benefit from strong demand for the recent products that we've\nintroduced, but that is more than offset by the headwinds to the Quest headsets.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.", "char_count": 2867, "word_count": 518, "token_count": 651, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

So I think that suggests that being able to make a significantly larger investment here is very likely to be a\nprofitable thing over some period because if the primary use of it is going to be to accelerate the AI research and the new AI work that we're doing and how that\nrelates to both the core business and new products. But any compute that we don't need for that we feel pretty good that we're going to be able to absorb a very\nlarge amount of that to just convert into more intelligence and better recommendations in our family of apps and ads in a profitable way. Now I mean, it's, of\ncourse, possible to overshoot that, right? And if we do, I mean, this is what I mentioned in my comments, then we see that there's just a lot of demand for other\nnew things that we build internally, externally, like almost every week, people come to us from outside the company asking us to stand up an API service or\nasking if we have different compute that they could get from us and we haven't done that yet. But obviously, if you got to a point where you ever built, you could\nhave that as an option. And then the kind of the very worst case would be that we effectively have just prebuilt for a couple of years, in which case, of course,\nthere would be some loss and depreciation, but we'd grow into that and use it over time. So my view on this is that rather than continuing to be constrained on\nCapEx and feeling in the core business like we have significant investments that we could make that we're not able to make that would be profitable. But the right\nthing to do is to try to accelerate this to make sure that we have the compute that we need, both for the AI research and new things that we're doing and to try to\nget to a different state on our compute stance on the core business. So that's kind of how I'm thinking about that overall. Of course, there's a lot of operational\nconstraints too on what one can build, right? So we're basically trying to work through this all, and I think we'll have more to share in the coming months and over\nthe course of next year. But I can think there's just a huge, huge amount of opportunities ahead here.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.", "char_count": 2763, "word_count": 525, "token_count": 613, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

So the way that I think about this is that the research is going to enable new technological capabilities to exist. And then those capabilities can get built into\nall kinds of different products. So the ability to reason more intelligently is, for example, very important across a large number of things. It would be useful for an\nassistant. It will also be useful in business AI. It will also be useful in the AI agent that we're building to help advertisers figure out what their campaigns are going\nto be. It will also have implications for eventually how we do ranking and recommendations of people's feeds and make different decisions there. That's just one\nexample. I mean certainly, the capability to be able to produce very high-quality good video is going to be useful for giving people new creative tools. It will help\nincrease the amount of content inventory that can be shown in Instagram and Facebook and therefore, should enable an increase in engagement there. It should\nhelp advertisers be able to create creative that will help us monetize better. So you can just go kind of down the list of capabilities that you'd expect. And I think\neach one will enable a bunch of different things. And I think the art of product development here is looking at the list of technology capabilities and figuring out\nwhat new products are going to be useful and prioritizing those. But fundamentally, I would sort of expect this exponential curve in new technology capabilities\nthat are going to become available. And the other thing that I expect is that I think being the best in a given area will drive great returns rather than -- this is not\nlike a check-the-box exercise of like, okay, we can generate some kind of content and someone else can. I think that like the company that is the best at each of\nthese capabilities, I think, will get a large amount of the potential value for doing that. So there are lots of different capabilities to build. I'm not sure that any one\ncompany is going to be the best at all of them. I doubt that's going to be the case. But a lot of what we're trying to do is not like not kind of do some things that\nothers have done. We're really trying to build novel capabilities. And I'm keeping this high level because I'm not -- I don't want to necessarily from a competitive or\nstrategic perspective, get into what we're prioritizing. But that hopefully gives you a sense of how we're thinking about what we're doing. We want to be able to\nkind of build novel things, build them into a lot of our products and then have the compute to scale them to billions of people. And we think that that's going to both\nshow up in terms of new products being possible in new businesses and very significant improvements to the current business, too.\n\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.", "char_count": 2865, "word_count": 514, "token_count": 596, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

And I think what we haven't really seen as much in\nthe history of the technology industry is the rate of new capabilities being introduced because around each of these capabilities, you can build many new products\nthat I think each will turn into interesting businesses. So yes. I don't know. I mean I'm generally pretty optimistic about there being a very large opportunity. But in\nterms of new things to build, I think being able to build them and then scale them to billions of people is a huge muscle that Meta has developed, and I think we do\nvery well. And I certainly think that, that's going to deliver a huge amount of value, both in the core business for all the ways that we talked about, how it's going to\nimprove recommendations and the quality of the services as well as unifying the models together. And so that way, when these systems are deciding what to\nshow they can just pull from a wider pool. And that we've -- these are things that we've just seen over the 20-plus years of running the company that they just\ndeliver consistent wins. That we're going to keep on being able to make the systems more general and smarter and make better recommendations for people and\nhave a larger pool of inventory. And that is all going to be great. And then there's going to be a lot of new things that I think we're going to be able to take and\nscale to billions of people over time and build new businesses, whether that's advertising or commerce supported or people paying for it or different kinds of\nthings. So yes, it's -- I think it's pretty early, but I think we're seeing the returns in the core business. That's giving us a lot of confidence that we should be\ninvesting a lot more, and we want to make sure that we're not under-investing.", "char_count": 2678, "word_count": 488, "token_count": 579, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}
