Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. We are off to a solid start in 2024. Consumer spending remained resilient with first-quarter \nyear-over-year payments volume growth at 8%. U.S. payments volume grew 5% year-over-year. International payments volume grew 11%. Cross-border volume \nexcluding intra-Europe rose 16% year-over-year in constant dollars with cross-border travel at 142% of 2019 levels, up from 139% in the fourth quarter. \nProcessed transactions rose 9%. Our net revenues increased 9% with GAAP EPS up 20% and non-GAAP EPS up 11%. As I reflect on the execution of our \nstrategy this quarter across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, I wanted to highlight a few key themes. One, we remain obsessed about \nserving our customers including traditional bank partners, neobanks, fintechs, wallets, sellers, acquirers and everyone else. Our focus on clients has enabled us \nto deepen our relationships with partners across all three pillars of our strategy. Two, we continue to seek new partnerships, new use cases and new verticals to \ndrive our business forward with a particular emphasis on cross-border. Three, we have gone to market with innovative solutions across our network of networks, \nseeking to add value for all transactions, no matter the network. And four, we are always looking for new and innovative ways to amplify our brand in service of \nour partners. With those themes in mind, let me provide some more details on the quarter. Let's start with consumer payments. We saw continued growth in \ncredentials, acceptance and engagement. Credentials grew 6% and we now have more than 8.7 billion network tokens, up 55%. Acceptance locations grew 17%. \nAnd let me highlight two recent examples of where we have expanded acceptance. The first was in Brazil with Caixa for cash conversion at their over 10,000 \nlottery branches. They are now accepting Visa credit and debit cards to pay for utilities, tax collection, lotteries and voucher payments which are called boletos. \nAnother example was in Asia-Pacific where we signed an agreement with Bcash, the largest mobile financial services player in Bangladesh.

Tap to pay grew five percentage points from last year to 77% of \nface-to-face transactions globally, excluding the U.S. In the U.S., we reached 45% penetration. One highlight from the first-quarter is that Lowe's has enabled tap \nto pay acceptance. We believe the tapping provides the best buyer and seller experience in the face-to-face environment and we've seen that play-out in the \nresults. In a recent Visa study in the U.S., we saw on average two more transactions a month and spend lift of $70 a month for those who tap with a Visa debit \ncard versus those who don't tap. Now on to some noteworthy updates from the quarter, which demonstrate our ability to deepen and expand partnerships as well \nas create new ones. In Europe, we renewed our agreement with isbank, the largest private bank in Turkey with 33 million cards for its consumer and commercial \ncredit and debit portfolios. As part of that renewal, they will be issuing the first Olympic and Paralympic Games credit card in Europe outside of France, leveraging \nour sponsorship. In Poland, we signed a new issuing agreement with PKO Bank Polski, the largest issuer and acquirer in Poland and Central Eastern Europe for \nconsumer and commercial debit. In Greece, we expanded our partnership with Piraeus Bank, the largest bank in the country to become their exclusive payment \nnetwork across their consumer and commercial credit and debit portfolios. These are all fantastic examples of the attractive position and strong pipeline in \nContinental Europe I spoke about last quarter. In Japan, we expanded our credit issuance partnership with e-Pass, one of the fastest-growing issuers in the \ncountry, affiliated with department store Marui. They will use Visa Managed Services, which is a part of our advisory solutions where we embed Visa employees \nwithin a client organization to help execute against key initiatives. In Korea, we renewed and expanded our partnership with Shinhan Card, the largest issuer in \nthe country for a consumer and commercial credit and debit. Shinhan has also committed to utilizing a suite of Visa's value-added services, including consulting \nand marketing to advance their business. In Mexico, we renewed our agreement with BBVA across consumer and commercial credit and debit along with \nvalue-added services, including risk, advisory and data tools. And last, in the U.S., we extended our agreement with Bank of America for multiple value-added \nservices, including visas loyalty platform service, CardinalCommerce 3D secure service, Verifi Order Insight digital service and DPS debit processing. We also \ncontinue to be a partner of choice for fintechs around the world. First, in the U.S., we renewed with leading fintech chime, further debit and credit builder secured \ncard portfolios as well as for Visa Direct. In Latin-America, we renewed our debit and credit contracts with Rappi, one of the largest fintech and merchant clients in \nthe region with more than 30 million customers. They will also utilize numerous value-added services, including CyberSource and Decision Manager. And finally, \nwe are excited about a new global partnership with HSBC for their fintech initiative Zing. Starting with the U.K., we are supporting the ambition to launch this \nmulti-currency proposition in more than 30 markets. Visa's capabilities through Tink, currency cloud and our consumer payment solutions offer a powerful \ncustomer proposition and rapid deployment for Zing and HSBC. Through these renewals and new partnerships, you can see how we are focused on building a \ndeep relationship across all the capabilities Visa offers. Now moving to new flows. We have updated our sizing of the new flows opportunity using the latest \nmarket data available. Excluding Russia and China, we see $200 trillion of opportunity annually across B2B, B2C, P2P and G2C, certainly an enormous number. \nWe are working with our clients to deliver Visa's commercial and money movement solutions to help digitize these flows on our network of networks. Starting with \nVisa Direct. Total transactions this quarter grew 20% to $2.2 billion. And on the P2P cross-border front, transactions grew more than 65% year-over-year. In \nterms of client highlights for this quarter, we have been developing partnerships for new use cases in verticals and we are continuing to drive cross-border \nvolumes. First, in new use cases, in addition to our existing P2P partnership in the U.S., we have expanded our Visa Direct relationship with Meta, launching the \nability for content creators on Meta's family of apps to cash out their earnings to a debit card. This launch, now live in the U.S., U.K., France and Italy, allows for \ncreators to receive their payout quickly and safely. Second, on cross-border volumes, we have continued to make progress in enabling global money movement\n\nacross our 8.5 billion endpoints in nearly 200 countries and territories. Western Union is a great example. We just signed a long-term global partnership\nagreement with Western Union covering issuance, Visa Direct and other services across 40 countries in five regions. This long-term collaboration will bring\nproduct innovations and digital-first customer experiences to enhance cross-border money movement. We also expanded our relationship with Remitly to enable\ncustomers from 30 countries to send cross-border payments to eligible debit cards and bank accounts in over 100 countries globally. In Canada, we recently\nannounced our agreement with CIBC and Simplii to provide millions of clients the ability to send money to digital wallets in key remittance destinations including\nthe Philippines, China and Bangladesh. On to the commercial side, total payments volume grew 8% in constant dollars. And throughout the quarter, we continued\nto focus on new verticals. Let me highlight a few specific areas. First, in the cross-border travel vertical, we recently expanded our agreement with Singapore\nbased B2B platform Nium. Their virtual card B2B travel program will expand from the U.S. and Europe into Australia, Singapore, Hong-Kong and Japan. Also in\nB2B travel, we signed a new virtual card agreement with Worldline, a leading global payment provider for travel intermediaries to pay their suppliers more quickly.\nIn the contractor vertical, we recently signed an agreement with United Overseas Bank and Doxa, a Singapore fintech for contractors. In partnership with Visa,\nthe Doxa platform has further been enhanced to provide embedded financing capabilities. Subcontractors will be given the option to be paid for their services\nthrough UOB virtual cards. And also with UOB, we renewed and expanded our commercial relationship across commercial debit and credit including the\nenablement of payment flows for the Singapore government. Let me move on to value-added services. Our network of networks strategy is also playing a key role\nin value-added services. As a reminder, this has three components. One, moving money to all end-points and to all form factors. Two, using all available networks\nand being a single connection point for our partners. And three, providing our value-added services on all transactions, no matter the network. We have continued\nto develop and expand our value-added services as part of this strategy. Let me cover three recent examples. Processing capabilities for RTP networks, Pismo\nand Prosa. Last quarter, I noted that Visa is becoming a certified service provider for FedNow, enabling financial institutions to receive funds through the FedNow\nservice. We have now enabled the ability to also send funds. The second example is Pismo, which we just closed last week. As I talk to clients around the world,\nparticularly issuing clients, there are two priorities that are increasingly on the minds of CEOs. The first is for many of our issuing clients, they've either recently\nembarked on or they're considering embarking on a transformation of their tech-stack from their legacy infrastructure to cloud-native API-based tech stacks. The\nsecond is that many clients, whether they'd be traditional issuers or fintechs, are increasingly looking to rapidly expand their issuance to new regions and\ncountries, especially the more developing markets around the world. Our clients are looking to Visa to help them with both of these priorities. And with Pismo, we\nwill be able to deliver to our clients the best cloud-native issuer processor in core banking platform in the world. Pismo offers global core banking and\nmulti-product issuer processing covering credit, debit and commercial with connectivity to local payment networks such as Pix. Our goal is for Pismo to be the\nplatform of choice for our issuing partners around the world, enabling them to accelerate their global expansion and transition to cloud-native platforms. And the\nthird example of our network of networks is our announcement to acquire a majority interest in Prosa, a payments processor in Mexico. A couple things about the\nMexican market. One, cash and check represent more than 50% of personal consumption expenditures. And two, today Visa has limited ability to process\ndomestically. We believe we can bring enhanced technology infrastructure and lay the groundwork to develop new innovative ways for consumers, small\nbusinesses and local issuers and acquirers in Mexico to pay and be paid. This includes improving safety, security and reliability and providing better experiences\nthrough our value-added services such as tokenization, risk products and more. We can also bring our innovation and commitment to continued investment for\nboth face-to-face and online transactions. Together, these efforts will help further digitize payments in the country. The investment is subject to regulatory review\nand we hope to close in the second-half of calendar year 2024. And finally, I want to highlight the opportunities to drive further growth in value-added services via\nthe development of new partnerships. These enable us to enhance our overall offering and distribution reach. Yesterday, we announced an agreement with digital\nworkflow leader ServiceNow to build solutions and distribute Visa's products and solutions to joint customers. To start, ServiceNow will launch in end-to-end\ndisputes management solution for issuers with plans to expand to additional segments and products over-time. This partnership showcases the demand for our\nvalue-added services and provides a compelling distribution channel to reach more customers around the globe. So, across consumer payments, new flows and\nvalue-added services, you can see the enormous opportunity as well as Visa strong relationships, commitments to our clients and innovation in new ways to pay\nand be paid. What helps to amplify all of these efforts is our brand. We recently renewed our long-standing partnership with FIFA, creating a powerful opportunity\nto drive business for both Visa and our clients, improve brand lift and maximize global reach. Not to mention, providing an opportunity to showcase and implement\nVisa's innovative payment technology. We're also launching our first new global sports sponsorship in more than 15 years with the Red Bull Formula One teams.\nThe partnership aligns our brand with two teams within Formula One which is one of the fastest-growing sports on the planet, providing another opportunity to\ndrive business for our clients. As we look ahead this year, we're excited to be activating our brand with our clients across all of these partnerships as well as the\nOlympic and Paralympic games in Paris. Before I hand it over to Chris, I wanted to mention that we hold our Annual Meeting on Tuesday. All of the proposals that\nthe Board recommended past including the exchange offer program proposal. As such, we will be moving promptly to file an S-4 with the SEC relating to the initial\nexchange offer. I also wanted to give a special thanks to my colleague, partner and friend, Alf Kelly, as Tuesday he officially retired as Executive Chairman. Alf,\non behalf of the entire Visa family, thank you for your exceptional leadership. You led this business to incredible heights, while also driving innovation, deepening\nour client relationships and strengthening our culture in so many ways. Your impact on Visa will be visible for generations. In closing, in the first-quarter, Visa\nonce again demonstrated the effective execution of our strategy across the globe. While uncertainty seems to be the norm, Visa has the experience and discipline\nto manage through the challenging environments and I remain optimistic and confident about our future. Now over to Chris.", "char_count": 12718, "word_count": 1993, "token_count": 2512, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

Good afternoon, everyone. As Ryan said, Q1 was a solid quarter with relative stable-growth in overall payments volume and processed \ntransactions and strong growth in cross-border volume. Looking at our drivers, in constant dollars, global payments volume was up 8% year-over-year and \nprocessed transactions grew 9% year-over-year. Cross-border volume growth excluding intra-Europe was up 16% year-over-year in constant dollars. Fiscal \nfirst-quarter net revenues were up 9% in nominal and constant dollars, which was on the high-end of our expectations, primarily due to lower-than-expected \nincentives and less FX drag. GAAP EPS was up 20% and non-GAAP EPS was up 11% in nominal and 10% in constant dollars. Now on to the details, starting \nwith the U.S. U.S. payment volumes grew 5% year-over-year, credit grew 6% and debit grew 5%. Card-present spend grew 3% and card not present volume \ngrew 7%. As we look at the monthly total U.S. payments volume growth rates throughout the quarter, we saw low in October and a peak in November with \nDecember in between. Putting it all together, the step-down of about 80 basis-points in total US payments volume growth from Q4 to Q1 was primarily due to a \nless favorable mix of weekends and weekdays compared to last year and a combination of a few small items, including a softer October and modest impact from \nReg II. Consumer spend across all segments from low to high spend has remained relatively stable. Our data does not indicate any meaningful behavior change \nacross consumer segments. Moving to holiday spend, which is the period from November 1 to December 31. In the US, consumer holiday spend growth was in \nthe mid-single-digits on a year-over-year basis. Consumer retail spending growth was similar to last year. However, retail spending growth on key shopping days \nfrom Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday was much stronger. E-commerce increased its share of retail spending versus last year. Moving to international markets, \nwhere total payments volume growth was up 11% in constant dollars, stable to Q4. Payments' volume growth rates were strong for the quarter in most major \nregions of Latin-America, CEMEA and Europe ex-U.K. each growing about 20% in constant dollars. Now on to cross-border, which I'll speak to in constant dollars \nand excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume was up 16% year-over-year. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth excluding travel \ngrew slightly faster-than-expected in the low-teens adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases. Cross-border travel-related spend grew 19% year-over-year. The\n\ncross-border travel volume index to 2019 increased from 139% in Q4 to 142% in Q1. Travel volume into Asia indexed at 132% of 2019 levels for the quarter, up\nthree points from Q4, while travel volume out of Asia was up four points to 118%. This was lower than last quarter's expansion, primarily due to relative weakness\nin Australia and Japan. Travel in and out of Mainland China continued to improve, but both remain below 2019 levels. U.S. travel inbound continued to improve\nseveral points from Q4 versus 2019 levels. And we continued to see healthy travel volumes in and out of LAC, Europe and CEMEA and out-of-the US, ranging\nfrom 145% to 170% of 2019 levels. Now let's review our first-quarter financial results, starting with the revenue components. First, as any new pricing usually\ngoes into effect in April and October, this quarter, each of our revenue components benefited as a result and the growth rates were either further enhanced or\noffset by the additional factors as follows. Service revenues grew 11% year-over-year versus the 9% growth in Q4 constant dollar payments volume with some\nadditional help from card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 14% versus 9% processed transaction growth, helped by business mix and value-added\nservices. International transaction revenues were up 8% versus the 16% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, impacted by\nlapping strong currency volatility from last year. Other revenues grew 18% with strong consulting revenue growth, but impacted by lapping 31% growth from 2023,\nprimarily from FIFA related value-added services revenue. Client incentives grew 20%, but ended-up lower-than-expected due to client performance and deal\ntiming. Across our three growth engines, consumer payments growth was driven by relative stability in payments volume growth and processed transactions as\nwell as strong growth in cross-border volume. This quarter, in new flows, the underlying drivers remained relatively stable. Commercial volumes rose 8%\nyear-over-year in constant dollars and Visa Direct transactions grew 20%. Total new flows revenue grew in the low-single-digits year-over-year in constant dollars\ndue to several one-time items and business mix impact. As you know, for any given period, there can be puts and takes, but most importantly drivers are stable\nand we continue to expect full-year 2024 new flows revenue to grow faster than consumer payments revenue. In Q1, value-added services revenue grew 20% in\nconstant dollars to $2.1 billion with strength and issuing and acceptance solutions. GAAP operating expenses declined 6%. The decrease in expenses was driven\nby a decrease in the litigation provision, somewhat offset by an increase in personnel expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 7%, primarily due to an\nincrease in personnel expenses. Excluding net gains from our equity investments of $4 million, non-GAAP non-operating income was $84 million. Our GAAP\ntax-rate was 19.1% and our non-GAAP was 19%, helped by larger-than-expected tax benefits. GAAP EPS was $2.39; non-GAAP EPS was $2.41, up 11% over\nlast year, inclusive of an approximately 0.5 point benefit from exchange rates. In Q1, we bought back approximately $3.4 billion in stock and distributed over $1\nbillion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of December, we had $26.4 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Now let's move to what we've seen\nso far in January through to the 21st. U.S. payment volume was up 4% with debit up 3% and credit up 4% year-over-year, down from December, largely due to\nsevere weather conditions in parts of the U.S. Process transactions grew 8% year-over-year. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within\nEurope, grew 16% year-over-year. Travel-related cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, grew 16% year-over-year or 146% indexed to 2019; and\ncross-border card-not-present ex travel grew 16%. Now on to our expectations. Remember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollar\nand excluding acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentation for more detail. For the full year, we have no material changes\nto our prior outlook for drivers, adjusted net revenues or EPS growth. Remember that our drivers assume no recession or a further increase in Reg II impacts.\nPismo is expected to have minimal benefit to full year net revenue growth and an approximately 0.5 point headwind to non-GAAP operating expense and EPS\ngrowth. FX is expected to have an approximately 0.5 point drag to net revenues growth and approximately 1 point benefit to non-GAAP operating expense growth\nand a minimal drag to non-GAAP EPS growth. Non-GAAP non-operating income is expected to be between $350 million and $400 million, with nearly half in Q2\ndue to the resolution of some non-U.S. tax matters. Putting it all together, adjusted net revenues growth is unchanged at low-double-digits, adjusted operating\nexpense growth is updated to low double digits, and adjusted EPS growth is unchanged at low-teens. For the second quarter, similar to the full-year, Pismo is\nexpected to have a minimal benefit to net revenues growth and an approximately 0.5 point headwind to non-GAAP operating expense and EPS growth. FX is\nexpected to have minimal drag to net revenues growth and an approximately 0.5 point benefit to non-GAAP operating expense growth and minimal benefit to\nnon-GAAP EPS growth. We expect adjusted net revenues growth in the upper mid to high-single-digits and adjusted operating expense growth in the\nlow-double-digits, north of 10%. Nonoperating income is expected to be highest in Q2 due to the resolution of some tax matters, as I noted earlier. As such, the\ntax rate is expected to be between 16% and 16.5% in Q2 with the full-year unchanged. This puts second quarter adjusted EPS growth in the high-teens. In\nsummary, we're off to a solid start in the first quarter. The fundamental drivers remain relatively stable, and with no material changes to our full year guidance, we\nremain focused on the execution of our growth strategy for the rest of 2024. As always, if the environment changes and there's an event that impacts our\nbusiness, we will, of course, adjust our spending plans. We remain thoughtful on balancing between short- and long-term considerations. And now Jennifer, let's\ngo to Q&A.", "char_count": 9025, "word_count": 1413, "token_count": 1986, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang\nHey, thanks so much. Just want a clarification and a bigger question here. Just on the clarification, the new flows up low single digits versus mid-teens last\nquarter. How did that come in versus plan? Were there some onetime issues? Because it sounds like the other metrics were in line. And then my question was\njust on U.S. volume running in the mid-single-digits here, it's pretty tight to PCE. I know there are a lot of factors like gas and e-com and Reg II, but just can you\nclarify your view on U.S. volume here in relation to PCE growth in the short to mid-term? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney\nTien-Tsin, it's Ryan. Why don't I start on the second part of your question and then Chris can answer the first part and add or correct any on the second part. I\nthink let's back way up for a second in the U.S. U.S. remains a significant opportunity for us in consumer payments. I mean, there's still a lot of cash, a lot of\nchecks, a lot of ACH. We're having great work with fintechs and banks to bring more people in on the carded front. We're doing work to expand acceptance, the\nservice industry, whether it's plumbers or contractors, charities, vending, parking, tap to pay. I mean, we continue to be very, very excited about the U.S. market. I\nthink as you said, and Chris can add some detail, in the quarter, there's some Visa-specific factors on the growth rate in the U.S. as it relates to PCE, like you\nwere talking about. But as we look forward, it continues to be a big opportunity for us. We continue to be excited about it.

Now specific to your question around the first quarter, it was impacted by a couple of factors: first, the mix of business, with\ncross-border volume growth slowing in Q1 as travel continued to normalize; and second, the growth was also impacted by a few onetime items that happened to\nbe larger than we might typically see in any given quarter.

I just wanted to ask a question around the new partnerships within value-added services. Ryan, it sounds like, as part of the priorities, you want to get\nvalue-added services on all the networks. And I think you were alluding to the fact that this is going to be maybe a bigger shared responsibility with this\npartnership growth, and ServiceNow is obviously a great example. But I'm just trying to reconcile kind of how we should be thinking about Visa maybe opening up\nthose opportunities with these two partnerships and what that may do at some point to the financial picture of the company? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney\nYes. Again, if I back up before I answer to the specific question about ServiceNow and partners, we're very excited about the progress that we've made on our\nvalue-added services strategy. We're excited about the momentum that we're seeing kind of in the market. We're excited to see our sales efforts really driving\nsuccess and performance across issuing, acceptance, risk and identity, advisory and open banking. And it's exactly as you were saying with partners like\nServiceNow. What we're finding is we can have great efforts selling to our partners directly around the world. But we're also getting a lot of demand from various\ndifferent platforms that already have relationship with thousands or tens of thousands or, in some cases, more customers in any one country or region. And\nthey're very excited to sell through our value-added services as a way of differentiating their platform and deepening relationships with their users and their\ncustomers.

One is the mix of spend days, but also there were a few smaller things, a softer\nOctober and the modest impact from Reg II that we're talking about. So a couple of things. It's important to note, we've actually not seen any meaningful changes\nto volumes being routed away since October. So all in all, the impact is modest, really hasn't changed over the past quarter, and that's actually what we have\nassumed and we shared for the rest of the year. Now to your second part of your question about one-time items, I talked a little bit about the things in the U.S.,\nReg II and the slow October. The other place where I talked about onetime items was in the new flows business. As I said, the revenue growth was impacted by a\ncouple of things. One, I talked about the cross-border normalization as on travel. And then secondly, there were these one-time items, and I'll give you an\nexample of one. In the normal course of our business, we regularly true up or true down our incentive and rebates with our clients based on their reported metrics.\nAnd in the first quarter, the net impact of these adjustments ended up being larger than we might typically see in a quarter.

Thanks. I'm going to break that down into two questions because, one, you said how do we feel about the revenue guide and then I think the second\nquestion implied there was on drivers. And so let me talk to those because they are a little bit different. And maybe I'll even start with the second part first, which\nis with drivers. We're 1 quarter into the fiscal year. It was a solid quarter, stable trends from Q4. And importantly, the consumer has remained resilient. As we look\ninto the rest of the year, we do anticipate drivers to continue to tick up slightly in the second half of the year for two reasons: one, average ticket sizes should\nimprove, in particular, as we lap lower ticket sizes in the second half of last year in the U.S. and we see continued inflation in certain international regions; and\nsecond, we're continuing to execute against our growth initiatives in our global markets, for example, the processing wins that we've seen in LAC that we've\nshared progress about previously. So that's sort of the underlying drivers. And then your first question actually was on revenue. We had a solid start for the year,\na really good Q1, stable Q4 trends. Today, we've reaffirmed our full year guide on net revenue in constant dollars, and that includes the modest impact of Reg II\nthat we talked about. So we feel good about Q1. We feel good about the outlook for the rest of the year, and we'll continue to focus on execution.", "char_count": 1447, "word_count": 260, "token_count": 320, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to dig into Pismo a little bit. The website talks about large banks, marketplaces and fintechs. And you mentioned\nearlier the movement away from the legacy systems into more modern cores. I want to talk a little bit about the ambitions and the potential in terms of the bank\nsizing. And also, these core conversions, are they for new product and sort of sidecar cores, if you will? Or are we talking about the potential for your core kind of\nissuing clients in the U.S., midsized banks, to be moving their legacy core potentially over to something offered by Pismo in the future?\nRyan McInerney\nSo let me step back and talk a bit about how we found Pismo and then answer your question directly, Timothy. I mentioned in my prepared remarks these \nnarratives and these priorities that we've been hearing from CEOs of banks all over the world, in the U.S. and all over the world, medium-sized, big-sized banks,\n\nwhich is, one, they're trying to make this transition from their legacy tech stacks to the cloud; and the second is they want to expand, especially in emerging\nmarkets where they don't have enough options of issuer processors to help them. That led us, hearing that over and over and over again, to go search the world\nfor what we thought was the best cloud-based processor and core bank provider that we could find. And that led us to Pismo. And so while Pismo is based down\nin Brazil, their platform is global. Their clients today are a mix of some of the biggest and most sophisticated banks in the world as well as medium-sized banks\nand fintechs. So they already today have a mix of different client types. And our ambitions, our ambitions are what I said in my prepared remarks, which is we\nwant this to be the preferred provider of banks around the world. You asked specifically about midsized banks in the U.S. for their core banking platform, the short\nanswer is absolutely. As you think about large banks and their issuer processing capabilities not just for debit, which we have today in the U.S., but for debit,\ncredit, prepaid, commercial, not just in the U.S. but globally, we think Pismo is absolutely a solution that our issuers could be using around the world. So yes, it is\na global platform. We have global ambitions. Given the relationships that we have, the privileged relationships that we have with banks, big and small, in the U.S.\nand around the world, we feel good about our ability to distribute the product to them.", "char_count": 2500, "word_count": 442, "token_count": 550, "exchange_id": "ex_005", "exchange_role": "question"}
