We delivered strong third quarter results with $8.9 billion in net revenue, up 10% year-over-year, and EPS up \n12%. Our key business drivers were relatively stable as compared to Q2, adjusted for leap year. In constant dollars, overall payments volume grew 7% \nyear-over-year, U.S. payments volume grew 5%, and international payments volume grew 10%. Cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe, rose 14%, and \nprocessed transactions grew 10% year-over-year.

I want to thank all of our 30,000 \nemployees who helped deliver these fantastic results. And as I review some highlights from the quarter, you'll see how this focus on serving our clients by \nmeeting their needs, innovating, and helping them grow is fueling our success across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Let's start with \nconsumer payments, where we see more than $20 trillion of opportunity to capture cash, check, ACH, domestic schemes and other forms of electronic payment. \nIn our client engagement survey, our clients ranked our strategic partnership and our brand as two of the most important factors to our successful relationships. I'll \nshare some examples of how each of these played out this quarter. In strategic partnerships, we are constantly seeking ways to add more value and grow \ntogether with our clients. We are pleased to have been named the Preferred Network Partner by Lloyds Banking Group, renewing our debit relationship and \nsignificantly expanding our relationship in credit, winning 10 million additional credit credentials across the Group's consumer and commercial business. Also in \nthe U.K., NatWest has launched a new Visa Travel Reward credit card, following the signing of our partnership last year. They will also be utilizing many \nvalue-added services, including transaction controls and card benefits. On the European continent, we worked with Raiffeisen Bank International AG, a leading \nbank in several markets. And recently, in the Czech Republic and Romania, we renewed our commercial business and expanded our consumer debit and credit \nbusiness totaling over two million potential new credentials. In Korea, we deepened our partnership with leading issuer KB Kookmin Card. Already a user of Visa \nDirect cross-border money movement and a Visa consumer and commercial issuer, they will grow their consumer credit and debit portfolios with Visa and use \nvalue-added services, including consulting and marketing services. In Peru, we extended our partnership with leading issuer, Banco de Credito de Peru, across \nconsumer and commercial portfolios with plans to launch additional new flows offerings and value-added services. In the U.S., we extended our agreement with \nWells Fargo. This will allow us to continue to support Wells Fargo's strategy to reinvent their credit business and provide additional growth by leveraging key Visa \nassets like consulting and Visa sponsorships such as FIFA and the Olympic and Paralympic Games. On the brand front, with the Olympic Games opening \nceremony later this week, it is exciting to see the engagement with the Visa brand and activation across the world in marketing campaigns, cardholder \nexperiences and Olympic and Paralympic-branded Visa issuance, which I am happy to report in Europe is at nearly six million cards compared to the five million \nnumber I quoted just last quarter. We have also added nearly 100,000 new merchant locations in France in advance of the event. Our brand also plays an \nimportant role in winning co-brand partnerships. In India, growing credit issuance and reaching affluent and cross-border consumers remain areas of focus. We \nare excited about the launch of a co-brand card with Adani One and ICICI Bank as India's first co-branded credit card with rich airport-linked benefits for their \ntarget base of 400 million customers through the Adani One platform. We also signed an agreement to launch a new co-brand card with Tata Digital, along with \nan Indian banking partner, building on the success of our existing credit co-brand relationship. This new co-brand offering consists of a multicurrency prepaid \nforeign exchange card that will target travelers from India, also benefiting from the rewards of the Tata Digital Super App, Tata Neu.

{"doc_id": "V_TRANSCRIPT_2024_Q3", "ticker": "V", "quarter": "Q3", "filing_date": "2024-09-01", "phase": "prepared_remarks", "speaker_name": "Latin America", "speaker_role": "unknown", "speaker_firm": null, "utterance_id": "u_0002", "utterance_type": "statement", "text": "using CyberSource. And in CEMEA, we reached a de novo co-brand arrangement with BinDawood, a leading grocer in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with 88 \noutlets and over five million loyalty program members. On the travel side, we extended our relationship with Malaysia Airlines from a prepaid co-brand card \ntargeting millennials and Gen Z customers to also launch a new co-brand credit card for the travel-minded affluent. And in the U.S., Turkish Airlines have chosen \nVisa to be their exclusive network partner for their new Miles and Smiles co-brand credit card. Our consumer payment strategy is focused on growing credentials \nas we are doing across all the partnerships I just mentioned and increasing acceptance locations. And wallets are a great example of where this comes together, \nwhere Visa can be a funding source, an embedded credential, and an accepted form of payment by wallet merchants. This increases the value proposition for \nwallet providers and their users. Two wallet highlights this quarter are in Peru and Vietnam. Yape is a Peruvian super app with more than 15 million users who \nalready have a Visa credential that enables them to send money across P2P apps via Visa Direct. And just recently, they launched Tap to Phone functionality for \ntheir more than two million merchants to accept Visa. And in Vietnam, a country with approximately 50 million wallet users, the three leading digital wallets, \nMoMo, VNPAY, and ZaloPay are now enabling their users to utilize Visa cards as a funding source for transactions at over 500,000 QR acceptance points \nmanaged by these wallets. One additional area that we are very focused on is delivering simple, easy, and secure checkout experiences. Let me share a few \nrecent examples. First, we are integrating Click to Pay and the Visa Payment Passkey Service, enabling a customer to authenticate themselves using biometrics. \nAlready, we have hundreds of issuers enabled for passkeys in Europe and a number of issuers who represent more than 50% of our e-commerce payments \nvolume in Europe piloting the solution. Second, we crossed 10 billion tokens this quarter, a significant milestone. And in 2023 alone, Visa tokens helped generate \nmore than an estimated $40 billion in incremental e-commerce revenue for businesses globally and saved more than $600 million in fraud. Third is the ability to\n\ntap for more use cases on a mobile device. With tapping as one of the best in-person commerce experiences, we want to provide Visa users with more ways to\ntap, including Tap to Pay, tap to authenticate an identity, tap to add a card, or tap to send money to family or friends. And finally, this quarter, Tap to Pay grew\nfour percentage points from last year to 80% of face-to-face transactions globally, excluding the U.S. In the U.S., we surpassed 50% and have 30 U.S. cities\nabove 60% penetration. Now moving on to new flows. This quarter, new flows revenue grew 18% year-over-year in constant dollars with Visa Direct overall\ntransactions growing 41% for the quarter to 2.6 billion and commercial volumes up 7% year-over-year in constant dollars. Let me provide some updates, starting\nwith B2B, where we have focused on penetrating new verticals and delivering innovative products and solutions. In healthcare, we will work with AXA and\nPaysure to launch a commercial virtual card solution to simplify the claims processes for their customers worldwide. We have also expanded our virtual card\nacceptance with a key business services provider, Cintas, who offers uniform, safety, and fire protection services to over one million customers. Together with our\npartner, Billtrust, we will help Cintas streamline their payments, automate processes, and manage costs on Billtrust's Business Payments Network or BPN. We\nalso just recently extended our long-standing BPN collaboration with Billtrust that connects suppliers and buyers to facilitate straight-through processing of virtual\ncard payments with rich data that optimizes acceptance costs. Our products and solutions in B2B remain very important in winning and growing our business.\nOne such solution is the enhanced B2B data that we can provide. In Brazil, together with Solero, a leading business financial management solution, we will\nprovide issuers with enhanced visibility into small business spend by aggregating data across cards, bank accounts, boletos and more, enabling them to better\nmanage their client relationships and offer compelling products. Another solution is Spend Clarity, which provides expense program management, including card\nissuance, controls, and reporting. Wells Fargo has white-labeled our solution called Wells One Expense Manager, which has now onboarded 6,000 corporate\nclients representing over one million users, providing access to their spend data. Now moving on to Visa Direct. We continued to grow our transactions through\nexpanded and new relationships. Over the past year, total Visa Direct cross-border P2P transactions have nearly doubled, with Europe and CEMEA being the\nlargest regions. In CEMEA, we are very excited to have renewed our Visa Direct relationship with fintech Monobank in addition to renewing their consumer and\ncommercial credit, debit, and prepaid portfolios. In Asia Pacific, we are partnering with China Zhongsheng Bank on cross-border capabilities, including Visa Direct\nand Currencycloud, allowing the bank to support cross-border payments for their merchant clients. Canadian fintech Nuvei has extended its agreement with us for\nVisa Direct across all cross-border use cases in more than 30 countries for their merchant clients and recently became the first Visa Direct enabler in Colombia.\nWe also executed our first global agreement with WorldRemit and Sendwave, enabling their customers to eventually send Visa Direct cross-border remittances\nfrom 50 countries to recipients in 130 countries. Quickly, a leading South Asian marketplace, has enabled Visa Direct cross-border remittance solutions for U.S.\ncustomers to send money to relatives and friends in India and the rest of South Asia. And in earned wage access, we reached an agreement with Weaver, a\nU.K.-based embedded finance provider. In addition to card issuance, they will be utilizing Visa Direct to enable Weaver's business clients to offer employee\nexpense reimbursement, reward and recognition, and earned wage access. Earned wage access provider PayActiv, who serves 4,000 businesses has renewed\nits agreement with us and will enable Visa+ for payouts. Similarly, we expanded our relationship with enabler, Astra. In addition to domestic disbursements, Astra\nwill now offer cross-border remittances, implement Visa+ to reach domestic wallets in the U.S., and expand to additional use cases, including payroll, earned\nwage access and marketplaces. Visa+ is still in the early stages but is fully rolled out and live for PayPal and Venmo users and more providers continue to join\nthe platform. Wrapping up new flows, we also renewed an agreement with FIS, an important issuer processing partner to enable a suite of value-added services\nand new flows capabilities for their clients, including Visa Direct. And now on to value-added services, where revenue was up 23% in the third quarter in constant\ndollars. Let me highlight some of the progress we have made in driving adoption and growth among our value-added services portfolio. First in issuing solutions.\nOne area of strong revenue growth this quarter was in card benefits, where we enable our clients to offer unique value propositions tailored to their customer\nbase in travel, entertainment, restaurants, insurance and more. Strong issuance in premium cards across most of our regions has fueled this growth in the third\nquarter. For example, in Latin America, travel benefits have grown with over 370,000 unique visits to our Visa Infinite Airport Lounge in Brazil, representing\ncustomers from a number of leading issuers. In addition, since its launch in 2022, our Visa Infinite Fast Pass in Brazil, which allows cardholders to get through\nairport security more quickly, has screened over one million travelers. These are among the top five card benefits in Brazil and deliver value to customers, issuers\nand Visa. We continue to add more benefits like the recently launched partnership with OpenTable to offer eligible Visa cardholders access to coveted restaurant\nreservations and experiences in the U.S., with plans to expand into Canada and Mexico. In Acceptance Solutions, third quarter growth was driven by increasing\nutilization across both token and e-commerce-related services. In e-commerce, one such example is with iFood, the largest food delivery platform in Brazil who is\nutilizing our Verifi solution to help prevent disputes before they become chargebacks. In addition, they will be using our authentication solutions. In Risk & Identity\nSolutions, we continued to see strong adoption by new and existing clients, driven in part by growth in card-not-present transactions. In North America, acquirer\nWorldpay will be expanding their use of our authentication solutions from CardinalCommerce, fostering collaboration and real-time enhanced data exchange\nbetween Worldpay merchants and issuers during card-not-present transactions, reducing fraud and allowing more transactions to be properly authenticated and\nauthorized securely. We are also pleased that the pilot of our account-to-account risk scoring solution Visa Protect with Pay.UK has had great results, showing an\naverage 40% uplift in fraud detection over the 3-month pilot period. In addition, we are now launching Visa Protect in Argentina with a core payments technology\ncompany, Celsa after successfully piloting the solution there as well. The last two value-added services are open banking and advisory services. We continue to\nsign new partners with Tink in Europe and the U.S. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong growth in client demand for our consulting and\nmarketing services, particularly around marquee events such as the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Our value-added services portfolio solutions is strong and is\ndriving meaningful growth for our clients and for Visa. Before I close, I wanted to speak to the fact that the settlement reached for the injunctive relief class was\nrejected by the court. We are, of course, disappointed with this decision. We believe that the prior settlement provided meaningful relief to all merchants and we\nwill continue to work towards another settlement. To close, so far this fiscal year, we have seen strong revenue and EPS growth as a result of relatively stable\nvolume and transaction growth. I remain very excited about the opportunity that lies ahead of us. At Visa, we come to work in service of our clients and partners\nand are focused on building and deploying the best solutions possible across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services.

Good afternoon, everyone. In Q3, we had another strong quarter with relatively stable growth across payments volume, cross-border volume, and \nprocessed transactions when compared to Q2, adjusted for leap year. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 7% year-over-year and cross-border \nvolumes, excluding intra-Europe, was up 14% year-over-year. Processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. Fiscal third quarter net revenue was up 10% in \nboth GAAP and constant dollars, in line with our expectations. EPS was up 12% year-over-year and 13% in constant dollars. Now let's go into the details. In the \nU.S., payment volumes growth numbers were generally in line with Q2 adjusted for leap year, with total Q3 payments volume growing 5% year-over-year, with \ncredit and debit also growing 5%. Card-present volume grew 2% and card-not-present volume grew 7%. In the U.S., while growth in the high spend consumer \nsegment remained stable compared to prior quarters, we saw a slight moderation in the lower spend consumer segment. Moving to international markets. Total \npayments volume was up 10% in constant dollars, relatively stable with Q2 when adjusted for leap year. Payments volume growth rates were strong for the \nquarter in most major regions, with Latin America, CEMEA, and Europe ex U.K. each growing more than 16% in constant dollars. Asia Pacific payments volume \nslowed to less than 0.5 point of year-over-year growth in constant dollars for the quarter, driven primarily by the macroeconomic environment, most notably in \nMainland China. Now to cross-border volume, which I will speak to today in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume \nwas up 14% in Q3, relatively stable to Q2 adjusted for leap year. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and adjusted for cryptocurrency\n\npurchases, was in the mid-teens, helped by continued strength in retail. Cross-border travel volume growth was also up in the mid-teens or 157% indexed to\n2019. This quarter, we saw the inbound Asia Pacific Index improve nine points at a similar pace to Q2 to 151% of 2019. The improvement in Asia Pacific\noutbound travel, however, slowed from Q2 with the index increasing by less than one point to 125% of 2019. We continue to see the same primary drivers as last\nquarter with some additional pressure from macroeconomic conditions. Now let's review our third quarter financial results. I'll start with the revenue components.\nService revenue grew 8% year-over-year versus the 8% growth in Q2 constant dollar payments volume, with revenue yield improving sequentially and versus last\nyear due to improving utilization of card benefit. Data processing revenue grew 9% versus 10% processed transaction growth with the revenue yield generally in\nline sequentially and versus last year. International transaction revenue was up 9% versus the 14% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding\nintra-Europe, impacted by lapping higher currency volatility from last year. Volatility levels remain consistent on average to last quarter. Other revenue grew 31%,\nprimarily driven by strong consulting and marketing services revenue related to the Olympics and, to a lesser extent, pricing. Client incentives grew 11%. Now on\nto our three growth engines. Consumer payments growth was driven by relatively stable payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transaction\ngrowth. New flows revenue grew 18% year-over-year in constant dollars. Visa Direct transactions grew 41% year-over-year, helped by growth in Latin America for\ninteroperability among P2P apps. Commercial volumes rose 7% year-over-year in constant dollars. In Q3, value-added services revenue grew 23% in constant\ndollars to $2.2 billion, primarily driven by Issuing and Acceptance Solutions and Advisory Services. Operating expenses grew 14%, primarily due to increases in\ngeneral and administrative personnel and marketing expenses, including spend related to the Olympics. FX was 0.5 point drag versus the 1.5 point benefit we\nexpected. Pismo represented an approximately one point drag. Nonoperating income was $73 million. Our tax rate was 18.8% and EPS was $2.42, up 12% over\nlast year, inclusive of an approximately 1.5 point drag from exchange rates and an approximately 0.5 point drag from Pismo. In Q3, we bought back\napproximately $4.8 billion in stock and distributed over $1 billion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of June, we had $18.9 billion remaining in our\nbuyback authorization. Now let's move to what we've seen so far in July through the 21st with volume growth in constant dollars. Cross-border is excluding\nintra-Europe. U.S. payments volume was up 4% with debit up 4% and credit up 3% year-over-year. The slight deceleration from Q3 does not appear to be from\nany one factor but likely a number of smaller factors such as weather, timing of promotional shopping events, and the technology outage, among others.\nCross-border volume grew 13% year-over-year, below Q3 levels with travel-related volume growing slightly less, which continued to be impacted by Asia Pacific\nand card-not-present ex travel volume growing at similar levels to Q3. Processed transactions grew 9% year-over-year. Now on to our expectations. Remember\nthat adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excludes acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings\npresentation for more detail. Let's start with the fourth quarter. We expect payments volume and processed transactions to grow at a similar rate to Q3. For total\ncross-border volume growth, we are expecting to end up slightly below Q3. Currency volatility continues to average around 4-year lows through July 21. And as\nsuch, we are making an adjustment to currency volatility expectations for Q4, now assuming volatility will stay in line with Q3 levels. Incentives are expected to be\nat their lowest growth rate all year. Pulling it all together, we expect adjusted net revenue growth in the low double digits, which equates to a slight improvement\nfrom the 10% adjusted revenue growth rate in the third quarter. We expect our Q4 adjusted operating expenses to grow in the high single digits. Nonoperating\nincome is expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. The tax rate is expected to be between 19% and 19.5% in Q4, which puts Q4 adjusted EPS growth\nrate in the high end of low double digits. Moving to the full year. With three quarters now complete, our expectations for full year adjusted net revenue growth\nremains unchanged from what we shared at the start of the year. Whilst absorbing the impact of lower currency volatility and the macroeconomic challenges in\nAsia, which have affected volumes, we still expect to reach low double-digit adjusted net revenue growth for the full year. Full year adjusted operating expense\ngrowth will be in the high single digit to low double digits, reflecting the less favorable impact of FX. This keeps full year adjusted EPS growth in the low teens. In\nclosing, we delivered strong results this quarter, with new flows and value added services revenue growing faster than consumer payments. We extended our\nexisting relationships, one new clients and invested to develop innovative products and solutions, all positioning us for continued growth into the future. But now\nJennifer, it's time for some Q&A.", "char_count": 7436, "word_count": 1161, "token_count": 1596, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "V_TRANSCRIPT_2024_Q3_u_0003", "company": "V", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2024, "period": "2024-Q3", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/V/V_FY2024_Q3.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

Hi Darrin. So let me start with the U.S. Let me start with the first part of your question, and then we'll maybe get into zoom out and talk about maybe the \nlonger question. So in the U.S. in Q3, we did see stable drivers relative to Q2, once you adjust for leap year. That's 5% payment volumes growth in the third \nquarter. In the 21 days since in July, that number did tick down to 4%. Maybe I'll just sort of give you the full arc of what we're seeing. So 4%, we'll just level set \non those numbers, 4% in the 21 days versus 5% in Q3. And so for that, we did stare at a lot of the drivers, the factors that impacted those three weeks. And there \nwas a lot going on and I referenced a few of them on the call and maybe I'll expand on those a bit. First, we had a major hurricane, Hurricane Beryl, and it \nimpacted Texas and other parts of the U.S. nearby. The second, I referenced the timing of promotional e-commerce events. Maybe I can expand on that a little \nbit. The timing this year was later and then e-commerce customers are billed, when the goods are shipped. And so, some of that shipping periods fell out of that \n21 period. So we had a little bit of difference in the 21 day period, to the comparable year ago. And third, obviously the major tech outage that happened at the \nend of last week, that also had some impact. So, when we look at that, no single factor drove that one point of change from Q3, to the first part of July. But all \nthings considered, we actually feel pretty good about the three week results. Now the second part of your question really was around sort of the low double-digits \nin the context of cross-border, VAS and CMS. I'll sort of back into the question. We've had consistent strong performance in VAS, over $2 billion of revenue, over \n20% growth for many quarters consecutively. And we're seeing strength across the business in issuing solutions and acceptance and advisory. That's a business \nthat we feel great about the momentum in. With our new flows business, 18% growth, as Ryan talked about, in the quarter, that's the second quarter in a row, \nwhere we're seeing growth in the teens, great execution, stable volumes, and visa direct transactions growing at a high level. As you know, that business also, \nquarter-to-quarter, can vary a little bit in the growth rates, as we saw in the first half of the year. But all in all, feel really good about the continued strength in that \nbusiness. And then cross-border, well, cross-border, maybe I'll just zoom out a little bit and talk about cross-border and what we've seen over the course of time.\n\nIf you recall, pre-pandemic, cross-border grew, travel grew in the high single-digits to low double-digits. And e-commerce, which was about a third of the\nbusiness, grew into the teens, sometimes into the mid-teens. Obviously, the pandemic happened, travel really contracted, e-commerce grew faster. And since\nthen, now post-pandemic, what we're seeing now is that e-commerce is roughly 40% of the business. And the growth rate has normalized. It's stabilized back to\npre-pandemic levels. And so let's say, teens growth on e-commerce on 40% of the cross-border business. Travel after the post-pandemic run-up has normalized.\nIt's a little hard to tell exactly where it's going to stabilize at, but we've seen high growth. We've seen it continue to normalize. But what we do know structurally, is\nthat with e-commerce being a bigger portion of the business, that's a tail into the total cross-border growth. And so, we are confident that that will continue to be\nhealthy relative to the domestic spend. I'll pause there and certainly if there's anything else to add, Ryan, or others, please jump in.\nRyan McInerney\nNo, nothing to add from me, Chris.

Good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the question. Very impressive value-added services growth this quarter at 23%. And I think as you mentioned, Chris,\nit's approaching 25% of total revenue, so perhaps driving more than half your consolidated revenue growth. Can you talk a little bit about at what point we might\nexpect value-added services to sort of bend up the growth curve of Visa consolidated?\nRyan McInerney\nIt's Ryan, Andrew. Thanks for the question. And yes, we're very excited about not only what we delivered, in terms of value-added services growth for the quarter.\nWhat we've been delivering consistently for several years now, since we shared with you all the strategy, and kind of became very purposeful about our\ngo-to-market approach. I mean, you go back to I think it was 2021, we did about $5 billion in revenue, 2022, $6 billion. Last year was $7 billion. Like you said, we\ndid $2.2 billion this quarter, up 23%. So I think what we've shown, is that we have delivered consistent growth quarter-after-quarter, and year-after-year in these\nbusinesses. And we're super optimistic about where we go from here. I mean, we think about the opportunities really in three different segments. The first is, we\nhave a series of value-added services, some of which Chris outlined in his previous answer that, are very focused on enhancing value for Visa transactions. Risk\nproducts like Visa Secure, dispute tools like Visa Resolve Online, card benefits, like I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And we've - that has historically been\nthe largest part of our value-added services business. And we've shown that we can drive great growth in that area. Increasingly, we're building out a set of\nservices that add value for non-Visa transactions. We've done some things in this space before. Some of our platforms like CyberSource, Authorize.Net, Verifi.\nBut then you've heard me talk in the last couple of quarters about expanding our risk capabilities. For example, to not just other card networks, but also to RFCP\nand account-to-account services. And I mentioned the great results we've had in both the U.K. and in Argentina on that front. And then the third area of\nopportunity for us, is expanding our value-added services beyond payments. Historically, we've had things like Visa Consulting and Analytics and our marketing\nservices And some of the open banking services delivered by Tink, but we're continuing to build out a portfolio of value-added services, for our clients and\npartners beyond payments things like the cyber protection capabilities that we've been bringing to market. So, we've demonstrated consistent growth. We believe\nwe'll be able to continue to demonstrate consistent growth. We've got a product pipeline, and a go-to-market approach all over the world with a diverse set of\nclients, and we feel good about the opportunity.", "char_count": 2865, "word_count": 467, "token_count": 617, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "V_TRANSCRIPT_2024_Q3_u_0008", "company": "V", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2024, "period": "2024-Q3", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/V/V_FY2024_Q3.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

Thanks for taking the question. I want to hit on that at the same time tackles, both incentives and value-added services revenue. So it's the concept of value\nin-kind incentives. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about whether or not, these are becoming more prominent, meaning you're using them a little bit more in\ndiscussions with issuers. And then, if you could just briefly recap some of the mechanics around the revenue recognition, the contra revenue, the addition to\ndeferred revenue. And then eventually, the value-added services revenue? Thanks a lot.\nRyan McInerney\nYes. I'll just give you the high level on this. The value in-kind is a great way for us to, as it says, to deliver value to our clients. And increasingly, our clients, as you\nsee in our performance are preferring to buy our value-added services, versus just take incentives that might drop to the bottom line. So that is absolutely\nsomething that, our clients are asking for more of. It's something that is helping our clients grow their businesses. And I talked earlier about just the last several\nyears about our product pipeline, how we've gone to market, how we built new products to solutions and services for our clients. And that's what's driving the\ndemand. So that's kind of become a more important part of our client renewals and our client renewal discussions.

Thanks for the question. 18% growth, as I mentioned, feel really good about the execution and the momentum in the business. It is an enormous opportunity\nthat we have in front of us, across both our commercial business and money movement with Visa Direct. I think you're familiar with the numbers, 41% growth in\nthe transactions and stable commercial volumes as well. I think what - this acceleration that you're referring to, we had a unique situation in Q1 where we had\nsome onetime items that really kind of depressed the growth, reported growth in Q1. And if you look at the last couple of quarters, it's more reflective, I think, of\nthe underlying health in the business. That said, as we saw in Q1, that growth rate can vary from quarter-to-quarter, based on deal timing and terms and one-time\nitems like the one that impacted Q1. And so overall, I'd say at the macro level, good momentum. The underlying business is healthy, and we're continuing to see\nthat level of growth. And the growth rate should be healthier, and should continue to grow faster than consumer payments, with some normal expected variability\nquarter-to-quarter.\nRyan McInerney\nAnd just to build on Chris' points, I think we're in the very early stages of Visa Direct growth.

So this is just another great example of, when we go and we systematically identify the need in the market, we spend the time, we\nbuild the infrastructure. We build 8.5 billion end points, the connectivity, the reliability, the security, the fraud capabilities.

And then just in terms of Reg II, is the\nfull impact of Reg II now in the run rate, or should we expect there be any uncertainties related to that? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney\nYes. I'll take both of them. On the first one, we're still in the early evolution of the use cases. I mean, we weren't even talking about earned wage access a couple \nof years ago, Sanjay. And so as we've got - I think we've got 65 or so use cases now on the platform, our teams are finding new use cases all the time. So I think \nwe're continuing to see the evolution of all of that and the economics of all that will play out. What I would point you back to, is what I mentioned in my prepared\n\nremarks, the tremendous success we're having in cross-border. We've had great success in selling new use cases, and driving cross-border transaction growth in\nVisa Direct. As you know, the yields are higher in cross-border, given the value that we add. So again, feel good about all of that. Listen, I want to just emphasize\nin terms of Reg II, the e-commerce debit market is a very competitive market, and is going to be competitive for as far as we can see. So while Chris noted, I think\nnoted that the impact has remained the same, we haven't seen any change in impact, and I don't - and we're not expecting any change in impact for the fourth\nquarter. It is a competitive business. We are out there with clients day in and day out, helping them understand the benefits of processing transactions on Visa.\nAnd there are a lot of them, which is why we feel good so far in the evolution of Reg II, about how we've been able to grow that business. We feel great about the\ncapabilities that a Visa data transaction offers, many of which I've talked about on these calls in the past.

I did say that\npayment volume, payment transactions, we anticipate Q4 to be consistent with Q3. The one exception to that is in cross-border, where I did say it'd be slightly\nbelow the Q3 levels.

Hi, Dan, thanks for the question on AI. First of all, to frame it is, we are all in on gen AI at Visa as we've been all in on predictive AI, for more than a decade.\nWe're applying it in two broad-based different ways. One is, sort of adopting across the company to drive productivity, and we're seeing real results there. We're\nseeing great results, great adoption, great productivity increases from technology, to accounting to sales all across the company. The second is applying\ngenerative AI to enhance the entire payment ecosystem. And to the latter part of your question, absolutely. I guess I'd give you one set of examples or some of\nthe risk tools and capabilities that we've been deploying in the market. I mentioned the risk products that we're using on RTP and account-to-account payments.\nThat is an opportunity to reduce fraud, both for merchants and for issuers. I think I mentioned on a previous call, we have our Visa Provisioning Intelligence\nService, which is using artificial intelligence to help predict token provisioning fraud before it happens. That also is a benefit to both issuers and merchants. And\nthe list goes on.

Ryan, Chris U.S. card volume growth of 5% in surface kind of suggests a little bit more of a mature market. Now I understand the category\ndifferences between card volume growth and DC growth, which influence the delta here. Ryan, you discussed your global down estimate of $20 trillion in\nconsumer payments for Visa. How should we think about, the secular digitization opportunity and the growth algorithm for the U.S., which is your biggest market?\nThank you.\nRyan McInerney\nOkay. It was a little hard for us to hear you, Harshita, but I think I got the gist of your question around the growth algorithm for consumer payments, especially in\nmature markets. So as I've said before, we see more than $20 trillion of opportunity around the world. About a quarter of that is in the U.S., by the way. And that's\ncash, that's check, that's ACH, that's electronic transactions, that's cards that run on domestic networks and the like. And we're capturing that opportunity through\na few different ways. One is continuing to expand acceptance and expand the places, where people can use cards. In the U.S., rent would be a great example.\nWe've been having some really good success, penetrating the rent vertical. The second is making it easier to drive e-commerce growth and e-commerce\ntransactions, which has an outsourced impact on our ability to drive growth on Visa, for those types of things. And third is just continuing to innovate with new\nproducts and services that, make our issuers want to issue Visa and consumers want to use them. We announced a full slate of new product innovations at our\nVisa Payments Forum this year. And those are the types of products that, we believe are going to help us win in the marketplace, and help us capture and digitize\na big chunk of that opportunity on the Visa network.", "char_count": 1826, "word_count": 315, "token_count": 398, "exchange_id": "ex_008", "exchange_role": "question", "chunk_id": "V_TRANSCRIPT_2024_Q3_u_0039", "company": "V", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2024, "period": "2024-Q3", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/V/V_FY2024_Q3.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}
