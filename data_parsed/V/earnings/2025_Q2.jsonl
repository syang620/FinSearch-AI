And with that, let me turn the call\nover to Ryan.\nRyan McInerney\nThanks, Jennifer. Visa is one of the world's best businesses with strong growth and leading profitability powered by a world-class brand, innovative technology, \nan unparalleled network, and global scale. This quarter, we saw the strength of our business model with $9.6 billion in net revenue, up 9% year-over-year, and \nEPS up 10%. Our key business drivers were strong. Even with the lapping of leap day from last year and consumer spending remained resilient in an uncertain \nand dynamic environment. In constant dollars, overall payments volume grew 8% year-over-year. US payments volume grew 6%, and international payments \nvolume grew 9%. Cross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe, rose 13% in constant dollars, and process transactions grew 9% year-over-year. Our strategy \nacross consumer payments, commercial and money movement solutions and value-added services continues to resonate with our clients, and we remain \nfocused on serving our clients through our innovation and product development. I will start with quarterly highlights and then make a few comments on the current \nenvironment. In consumer payments, we continue to execute the fundamentals, expanding credentials and acceptance, and driving user engagement in order to \ngrow both carded and non-carded volumes. Total credentials grew 7% with generally consistent growth across our regions. We added 1 billion tokens since last \nquarter to total 13.7 billion, and now nearly 50% of our e-commerce transactions globally are tokenized. We also crossed 1 billion tokens in Latin America and 0.5 \nbillion in CEMEA. And we continued to make progress, displacing cash in key markets. For example, India, Mexico and Brazil each added more than 1 million \nmerchant locations in the last year as we have driven greater acceptance, including with smaller merchants. We recently signed an agreement with Efecty, one of \nthe biggest cash networks in Colombia, with over 30 million users. Efecty will launch 4.5 million consumer debit cards and build acceptance with their cash \nagents. We also convert closed-loop to open-loop opportunities. For example, I'll highlight two transit deals in Latin America, one in Argentina with Banco de la \nNaci\u00f3n to launch an open-loop SUBE Visa card for use on public transportation. And two, in Chile with Metropago to also launch an open-loop Visa card, and at \nacceptance locations at transit stops. As we mentioned at Investor Day, what gives us confidence in our ability to grow consumer payments are our products and \nour solutions. They are enabling us to succeed in important high-value consumer payments use cases, innovations such as Tap to Everything, tokens, \nmulti-currency cards, flex credentials, account-to-account solutions, and our differentiated cardholder benefits platforms. I'll note some progress this quarter. Our \nefforts in Tap to Everything continued, driving cash digitization and habituation. Tap to Phone added nearly 2 million transacting device terminals since last \nquarter, with growth primarily driven by Latin America, the US, and Europe. Tap to Pay penetration is now at 76% globally, with the US passing 60% for the first \ntime. Penetration at US drug stores, retailers, and quick-service restaurants is now above 60% as well. Tap to Add Card continued to gain traction, and with the \nmajority of fraud being eliminated as compared to manual entry, it's not surprising that we now have nearly 150 issuers participating globally in more than 35 \ncountries and territories. Tap to P2P is a Visa product that leverages tokenization for enhanced security. Visa's tap kernel and SDK technology for seamless \ncontactless data transmission between devices and the convenience of Visa Direct's real-time money movement for funds transfers. We are soon launching our \nTap to P2P products in the US with Samsung. Samsung Wallet will introduce this innovative P2P payments feature that will allow users to quickly send money to \nfriends or family by just tapping a phone to a debit card or another phone, a strategy focused on enabling cross-platform functionality across mobile wallets. \nAnother development is in our stablecoin offerings. We believe two important capabilities are interoperability and programmability. We have continued to expand \nour interoperability, including with our first seven-day-a-week stablecoin settlement, recently surpassing $200 million in cumulative stablecoin settlement volume. \nOn programmability, we also developed the Visa tokenized asset platform to help enable banks to issue and leverage stablecoins for new types of programmable \nfinance. Our first pilot partner, BBVA, plans to launch a stablecoin later this year on the Ethereum blockchain. In our focus to attract and retain the affluent and \ncross-border traveler, we continue to evolve our Infinite product and are excited about the launch of the Scotiabank Passport Visa Infinite Privilege card, offering \nelite travel benefits for Canadians. The card provides travel rewards, insurance, and exclusive perks. Moving to commercial and money movement solutions. As \nwe drive further penetration of these opportunities, we have seen strong results in the second quarter with commercial volume up 6% in constant dollars, Visa \nDirect transactions up 28%, and CMS revenue up 13% year-over-year in constant dollars. In Visa Commercial Solutions this quarter, we made progress on our \nstrategy as we deepened our relationships with a number of existing clients. To capture the accounts receivable and accounts payable opportunity, we are \nutilizing product innovations such as embedded finance solutions to meet payers where they manage their business to drive adoption of cards. We are pleased \nthat Lloyds has signed a deal with Taulia to issue and embed Visa virtual cards in the SAP ERP and procure-to-pay workflows of their customers. Our \nvertical-specific strategies serve the needs of small, middle-market, and large businesses. In that light, we are supporting Itau in their card as a service platform, \nwhich offers credit and debit card issuance, product life-cycle management, and digital accounts to businesses across agribusiness, real estate, auto and \nretailers. In the B2B travel vertical, we continue to see strong demand for innovative payment solutions to transact in multiple currencies, while enhancing \npayment security, reconciliation, and operational efficiency. We expanded our agreement with Leon Lea Global to launch a B2B travel solution in Hong Kong. \nLeon Lea Global will also be utilizing Visa Direct multi-currency capabilities to support end-to-end collections and payouts. Continuing with Visa Direct, this \nquarter we signed an important deal with Jack Henry to offer Visa Direct through their digital applications to facilitate rapid transfers among bank accounts and \nenable their community and regional financial institution clients to offer Visa Direct to their consumer account holders and SMBs. In the cross-border space, \ncheckout.com is the first acquirer in the UAE to launch Visa Direct's push-to-card solution, enhancing real-time money transfer capabilities for both cross-border\n\nand domestic transactions. And in the US, we expanded our agreement with TabaPay, a money movement platform serving more than 6,500 fintechs and\nenterprises. Visa Direct will now be enabling push to account and wallet in addition to push to card. These are all examples of our strategic focus to grow our\ndomestic and cross-border business and expand with our existing customers for Visa Direct, the largest money movement platform in the world by transactions,\nvolumes, and endpoints. In value-added services, we continued to deepen our relationships with our existing customers and also focused on attracting new\ncustomers with some of our recently acquired assets. Value-added services revenue grew 22% in constant dollars, powered by strong growth across all\nportfolios. I'll share a few areas of success in the execution of our strategy. In issuing solutions, Pismo brings a holistic offering with credit, debit, prepaid, and\ncommercial issuer processing and core bank processing. We have a strong pipeline, and we are well on our way to enter five new countries across four regions\nthis year. Some recent deals to note include, First in Latin America with Nequi in Colombia, and Banco de la Naci\u00f3n in Argentina. And in Asia-Pacific with T2P in\nThailand and [indiscernible] in India. Also in issuing solutions, we continue to grow our card benefits business. In Europe, Raiffeisen Bank International in Austria\nrecently launched the travel sentive travel platform, leveraging our solutions as well as added Visa's PriorityPass benefits to customers. In acceptance solutions,\nwe recently announced two new product offerings. The first is a completely new version of Authorized.net, launching in the US next quarter and additional\ncountries next year. It features a streamlined user interface, AI capabilities with an AI agent, A-Net, improved dashboards for day-to-day management and\nsupport for in-person card readers and Tap to Phone. It will help businesses analyze data, summarize insights, and adapt to rapidly changing customer trends.\nThe second is the new unified checkout experience, available in the US and in pilot stage in additional markets in Q4. As new ways to pay continue to emerge,\nmerchants want to integrate once to accept all payment types to decrease the likelihood of lost sales at the point of checkout. Unified checkout can be launched\nin a few hours with a deploy-ready payment acceptance code. It is designed to deliver strong e-commerce conversion rates with an intuitive checkout experience,\norchestrating over 25 card and alternative payment options. Because unified checkout is part of the Visa Acceptance Solutions platform, customers also have\naccess to fraud management, 3D secure authentication, and tokenization management. We also continued to grow our client relationships in Acceptance\nsolutions this quarter. For example, we have now become the payment service provider of choice for sporting goods retailer Decathlon, who has more than 2,000\nstores in nearly 80 countries. Decathlon will be using our gateway and decision manager capabilities for their e-commerce business. In risk and identity solutions,\nsince the closing of our acquisition of Featurespace, we have been actively pursuing deals and have signed over 20 clients globally. We also now provide an\nenhanced holistic fraud protection solution from Featurespace called the Adaptive Real-time Individual Change-identification or ARIC Risk Hub. This solution\nutilizes machine-learning and AI solutions to enable clients to build more accurate risk profiles and more confidently detect and block fraudulent transactions,\nultimately helping to increase approvals and stop bad actors in real-time. In advisory and other services, our open banking platform, powered by Tink, provides\npayment initiation and account information services to sellers and payment providers or PSPs across Europe and the United States. In Germany, Tink and Adyen\nare working with Recharge and Vodafone to provide their customers the option to pay by bank when checking out. Tink has reached a milestone of over 10,000\nmerchants choosing Tink's pay by bank capability via our more than 10 European PSP partnerships. Across our VAS portfolio, our innovations are designed to\naddress specific challenges in the payments ecosystem and to provide secure, efficient, and scalable solutions for businesses of all sizes. At Investor Day, I\nspoke about the evolution of our Visa as a service stack. The foundation of our stack is our global connectivity and the infrastructure that Visa is built on, our\nnetwork, our network of networks, and access to our credentials and acceptance. Then we have our services architecture, which contains the specific capabilities\nthat we think of as the building blocks for everything that we do, like risk, settlement, and more. Using these services, we create client solutions. We are taking\nthese componentized capabilities and investing in and enhancing them to create new features and capabilities to offer them to a much broader array of customers\nand partners. And we strive to make it easier than ever for our partners and clients to access these solutions. I encourage all of you to tune in tomorrow to Visa's\n2025 Product Drop, where we will share how we continue to evolve the Visa as a Service stack to further our product development and lead in AI. You can watch\nlive on our website at 10 A.M. Pacific Time. Before I hand over to Chris, I'll share some thoughts on our business performance and the current environment.\nThroughout our history, we have evolved our network and strategy to deliver the best innovation, serve our clients, and pioneer the future of payments. We saw\nthe result of these efforts this quarter with our strong financial performance. Halfway through our fiscal year, consumer spending has been resilient and strong,\nbut there's much uncertainty. Focusing on the US, in Q2 and through April 21, we have not seen any signs of overall consumer spending weakening. While\nspending growth differs among consumer spend bans, with the most affluent growing the fastest, all spend bans remain resilient and consistent with past\nquarters. Within spend categories, there are some select areas, such as in travel with airlines and lodging, where growth has decelerated, but overall\ndiscretionary and non-discretionary spend remains strong. Outside the US, we see similar stable trends. Within cross-border, volume growth was in line with Q4\n2024 levels. We have seen some impacts from currency weakness and travel to specific countries, but the overall growth was above the pre-COVID trend. To\nwrap up, while we are certainly not immune to the macroeconomic impacts, our incredibly diverse business model has proven to be resilient in the face of a\nvariety of environments, most recently in Q2. And we see this resilience playing out in our financial outlook, which Chris will cover in a moment. For the rest of the\nyear and beyond, what I, our leadership team, and our more than 31,600 employees are focused on is serving our clients and capturing the enormous\nopportunities ahead. We focus on what we can control and stand ready to make thoughtful adjustments when necessary. I am confident that our business model,\nstrategy, and employees will continue to keep Visa operating from a position of strength well into the future. And with that, I'll turn it over to Chris to review the\nfinancial results, discuss what we have seen so far in April, and provide our expectations for the rest of the year.", "char_count": 15977, "word_count": 2482, "token_count": 3189, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

Our second-quarter results reflected strength in our business. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up \n8% year-over-year, and cross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe, was up 13% year-over-year. Total process transactions grew 9%. Adjusting for the lapping \nof leap year, our trends were generally stable. Fiscal second-quarter net revenue was up 9% year-over-year in nominal dollars and 11% in constant dollars, \nhelped by resilient consumer spending, lower-than-expected incentives, and better-than-expected value-added services revenue. EPS was up 10% \nyear-over-year and 11% in constant dollars, better-than-expected, primarily due to stronger operating performance and a lower tax rate than expected. Let's go \ninto the details. Total international payments volume was up 9% year-over-year in constant dollars in Q2, relatively consistent with Q1 when adjusted for leap \nyear. US payments volume was up 6%, with e-commerce growing faster than face-to-face spend. Credit was up 5% and debit was up 7%. When we look on a \nmonthly basis in the US, we had a strong January, a dip in February, primarily due to the lapping of leap year and a relatively strong March, even with the fact that \nEaster was in March last year and in April this year, which resulted in Q2 year-over-year growth being below Q1, but better than Q3 and Q4 of 2024. When \nlooking further at quarterly spend category data in the US, adjusted for leap year, we saw travel and entertainment growth decelerate, restaurant growth remained \nstable, and retail and fuel growth improved with strong and stable total discretionary and non-discretionary spend growth, reflecting resilience in consumer \nspending. Now to cross-border volume, which I'll speak to in constant dollars and excluding Intra-Europe transactions. Before going into the detailed results, I \nwanted to spend a moment to discuss the makeup of our cross-border business. From a geographic mix perspective, our total cross-border volume is fairly well \ndistributed, with no reported region comprising more than 25% of total cross-border issued volume. Both e-commerce and travel issued volume reflect a broad \ndistribution as well. You may also recall that our total cross-border issued volume mix is about 40% e-commerce and 60% travel. So there is diversity by region \nand by spend type. Keep in mind that just as our cross-border volumes are distributed, so are the associated revenues. Now on to the results. Total cross-border \nvolume was up 13%; e-commerce was up 14%; and travel was up 12%. There were several factors that contributed to the growth moderation from Q1 to Q2, \nincluding the lapping of leap year, the timing of Ramadan and Easter, weaker currencies in certain countries, and softer Canada to US travel. Some of these\n\nfactors impacted our intra-quarter trends, which varied slightly from US payment volume trends. While we saw a strong January and a February impacted by leap\nyear, we did see a somewhat softer March. Even with these factors, as Ryan mentioned, the total cross-border volume growth was in line with Q4 2024 levels and\nabove the pre-COVID trend. With that as a backdrop, I'll move to discuss our financial results, which were strong. Starting with the revenue components. Service\nrevenue grew 9% year-over-year versus the 9% growth in Q1 constant dollar payments volume. Data processing revenue grew 10% versus 9% process\ntransaction growth, primarily due to value-added services and pricing. International transaction revenue was up 10%, below the 13% increase in constant dollar\ncross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe, but in line with nominal volume growth, reflecting the impact of FX. In addition, while we had higher volatility in Q2,\nthis was offset by a number of factors, including client mix and hedging. Other revenue grew 24%, primarily driven by growth in advisory and other value-added\nservices and to a lesser extent, pricing. Client incentives grew 15%, lower than expected, primarily due to factors related to deal timing. Now, to our three growth\nengines. Consumer payments revenue was driven by strong payments volume, cross-border volume, and process transaction growth. Commercial and money\nmovement solutions revenue grew 13% year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by commercial payment volume growth of 6% year-over-year in constant\ndollars, consistent with last quarter. And Visa Direct transaction growth of 28% year-over-year to 3 billion transactions, below Q1 growth, primarily due to the\nlapping of our initial ramp in Latin America for interoperability among P2P apps and the lapping of leap year. CMS revenue growth in Q2 moderated from the first\nquarter, primarily due to lower cross-border volume growth and the absence of the lapping benefit of one-time items. Value-added services revenue growth\naccelerated to 22% in constant dollars to $2.6 billion, with strength across all portfolios led by issuing solutions and advisory and other, and inclusive of\nFeaturespace. Operating expenses grew 7%, primarily driven by increases in personnel, marketing, and depreciation and amortization. This was lower than we\nexpected, primarily due to a more favorable FX impact from balance sheet remeasurement and some marketing campaigns and advisory services related\nexpenses being shifted to Q3. Our tax rate for the quarter was 16.9%, lower than expected due to several items, including a change in our geographic mix of\nearnings. EPS was $2.76, up 10% over last year, with an approximately 1.5 point drag from exchange rates and an approximately 0.5 point drag from\nacquisitions. In Q2, we bought back approximately $4.5 billion in stock and distributed $1.2 billion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of March, we had\n$4.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. And in April, the Board of Directors authorized a new $30 billion multiyear share repurchase program. Now\nlet's move to what we've seen so far in Q3. Through April 21st, driver trends have been strong, with some benefit from Easter and Ramadan timing. US payment\nvolume was up 8%, with debit up 9% and credit up 7% year-over-year. Process transactions grew 12% year-over-year. For constant dollar cross-border volume,\nexcluding transactions within Europe, total travel and e-commerce cross-border volume each grew 13% year-over-year. Now on to our expectations. Remember\nthat adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings\npresentation for more detail. As we said many times, we are not economic forecasters. The potential impacts from tariffs have led to higher levels of economic\nuncertainty. That being said, what we've seen thus far in our results is relative resilience in consumer spending. So with that as a backdrop, let me cover some of\nour key assumptions that are incorporated. For cross-border volume, our assumption is that Q3 and Q4 volumes are in line with the average of March and April,\nwhich normalizes for Easter and Ramadan timing as well as accounts for other factors I referenced when describing Q2 results. This puts Q3 and Q4\ncross-border volume growth slightly below Q4 2024 levels. For volatility, we have seen high FX volatility thus far in April, but assume this will moderate starting in\nMay and remain level for the remainder of Q3 and Q4. This puts Q3 just above Q2 and Q4 more in line with Q2. For incentives, as a result of some client\nperformance adjustments and deal timing, we are assuming that the year-over-year growth in incentives in the back-half will be higher than the first-half, with\nsequential step-ups in Q3 and Q4. Pulling it all together, we expect third-quarter adjusted net revenue growth in the low-double-digits, essentially in line with Q2.\nMoving to operating expenses. As we had some timing impacts of expenses in the second quarter, we now expect those to occur in the third quarter with adjusted\noperating expense growth in the low-double-digits, relatively consistent with adjusted revenue growth. Non-operating income in the third quarter is expected to be\napproximately $150 million, which includes a benefit from the reversal of accrued interest expense due to the resolution on the tax matter. And our tax rate in the\nthird quarter is expected to be between 17% and 17.5%. As a result, we expect third quarter adjusted EPS growth to be in the high-teens. For acquisition impacts,\nwe expect a minimal benefit to net revenue growth, an approximately 1 point contribution to operating expense growth, and an approximately 0.5 point headwind\nto EPS growth in the third quarter. Moving now to the full year. Our full-year guidance for adjusted revenue growth, adjusted operating expense growth,\nnon-operating income, tax rate, and adjusted EPS growth remains unchanged. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter in Q2, and our business remains\nsteady. As Ryan said, throughout our history, we've managed through different economic cycles, and we're confident we'll manage through this period as well.", "char_count": 9115, "word_count": 1433, "token_count": 1952, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

We covered a number of moving parts in our travel and cross-border business as it impacted Q2 and gave some assumptions about what we\nanticipated going into the back-half of the year. I think I'll make two points. One is, obviously, the situation is quite fluid, and we're monitoring the data very closely,\nand we're really relying on facts and facts and the results as we see them. But the second point maybe is even more important is that when we look across our\nbusiness, we talk about the diversity of our business across -- in many dimensions. Regional is one of them. But certainly, when we look at our cross-border\nbusiness, whether that's issued or acquired, we also benefit from that diversity. And when it comes to inbound travel into the US, the US specifically actually is\none of the smaller regions as measured by cross-border inbound travel volume, even though it does have strong yields.

Chris, just to follow up on your point just now on the corridors and the US one specifically. Obviously, we're hearing a lot of travel information, how\nthings are falling off coming into the US, especially from Canada. Maybe you could just talk about what kind of assumptions you've made for the remainder of this\nyear, because I know that has an impact on sort of the economic return from each of those corridors. So maybe you could just help us with that. And then just\ncurious, inside of the volumes that you saw intra-quarter and even early in April, did you see any evidence of a pull-forward of spending? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney\nGot it. Hi, Sanjay. A two-part question. Let me address actually the second one first, because that's a quicker one. There was some evidence of pull-forward. In\ncertain categories, electronics is one of them, and it was mostly in sort of the first part of April, and we shared with you the data through the 21st. And actually,\nwhile I'm speaking about April, I just saw the data through the 28th just this morning, and that's relatively unchanged as well. And so there's no meaningful\ndifferences even as we get further into April. And so from a pull-forward standpoint, we may have seen a little bit in the first part of April, but all -- by and large, not\na meaningful impact to our total growth. And then going back to cross-border assumptions, so I shared a number of them, and I went through in my prepared\ncomments, a number of the items that impacted the cross-border numbers in the month of March. And as it pertained also to the month of April, Ramadan and\nEaster were two that had timing differences that impacted March and April. But then I spoke to two other factors. One, a broader category around currency\nweaknesses, and currency weaknesses have an impact on purchasing power, obviously abroad. We had the US dollar weakening, but we also had currency\nweaknesses in LAC, in Mexico, in different countries throughout Asia. And so that's also impacting the results that we saw in March and April. And then the last\none, of course, is Canada. And I referenced it on the call, I could give a little bit more color. I mean, we did see a meaningful slowdown in the Canada to US\nborder. But again, keep in mind the diversification of our business. And so the fact that, as I just mentioned in the last question, the fact that the US is one of the\nsmaller regions as measured by cross-border travel inbound volumes. And so when you add that up, it's really not a -- it's a very small percentage of our global\ntravel volume, and the revenue impact shouldn't be meaningful. And so what we did in terms of assumptions is we took the average of March and April, which we\nthink accounts for all of those items, and we extended that through the remainder of the fiscal year, and that would put cross-border at just below what we finished\nFY24 at in Q4.", "char_count": 2898, "word_count": 524, "token_count": 651, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

Hey, Chris. Thanks for taking the questions this evening. Maybe you can dig into value-added services. Good to see the robust growth there. Maybe\nyou could just unpack that and just talk about your viewpoint and how that performs through the cycle. Obviously, there's a range of revenue models in their\ntransaction-based, project-based, and recurring/subscription. But if you'd unpack, that would be great. And then any detail on how you're thinking about\nvalue-added services growth in the back-half would also be helpful. Thanks so much.\nRyan McInerney\n\nYes, why don't I just talk a little bit about the business, and then, Chris, I'll let you talk about some of the financial aspects of the question, both in terms of what\ndrove the strong performance in the quarter and also where things are headed. Yeah, we just -- we feel really good about the strategy, our execution, our\nproducts. I highlighted some really exciting new products in my prepared remarks. And I was just going to go back to some of the things we shared with you at\nInvestor Day about our execution approach. We're -- we've got -- you asked a little bit about some of the business drivers of what happens there. And we've said\nabout 65% of our revenue is really about enhancing Visa payments. But we've been really making a lot of progress on the incremental opportunities to enable all\ndifferent types of payments, not just Visa payments, and the services that then go beyond payments. If I kind of go back to an example in my prepared remarks, I\ntalked about the authorized.net platform that we've relaunched and we're relaunching. That's a great example of enabling all different types of payments. And\nthat's going to be, we think, a really positive impact in the market, specifically focused on growing our share in small-business checkout. And you go back to what\nI mentioned in terms of our unified checkout experience that will impact all different sizes of sellers on our platforms. Those are two examples, obviously, in the\nacceptance business. But if you go back to our Issuing Solutions business, we're having great progress with Pismo and a lot of our other solutions there as well.\nOur risk and security solutions business, really excited about the progress in market we've made since we acquired Featurespace. And then in our advisory and\nother business, we've been having some really strong success as well. So thanks for that question.

I think, Andrew, I think the heart of your question is how -- in addition, obviously, Ryan covered all the sort of the highlights of the\nbusiness performance, I won't reiterate those.

And the way\nthat I would think about it, the way we think about it is obviously, a lot could happen. We're monitoring that sort of the macro situation, we were not economic\nforecasters. But the thing I'll say about our business, I made the point about diversity previously, what does that mean with a little bit more color? We have, for\nexample, our business today, if I compare it to previous economic cycles, we have more exposure to everyday spending. We have a bigger debit business. We\nhave more e-commerce spend. We're more diverse geographically. And so you got to think about sort of how the business might get impacted today, and it might\nbe different from previous cycles, and we do have greater diversification broadly. And then, as it comes to that, specifically, as Ryan said, there is a 65% of the\nbusiness has a close correlation to Visa transactions. And so that part, depending on how the business would respond, could have a closer relationship, but\nthere's a great diversification there as well, as we have a good portion of the VAS business that is independent of Visa transactions.

In terms of what we expect for the full year and into the second half of the\nyear, we've updated the expectation that in the back half of the year, our growth will be slightly higher than originally expected due to two factors that we called\nout. One is client-related performance adjustments, and the second is deal timing, which means specifically anticipated early renewals. And so when we\nreforecast the second-half of the year, we do expect the second-half to grow higher than the first-half of the year, and we do expect that sequentially to be Q3 a\nlittle higher than Q2, and Q4 to be a little higher than Q3.

I think you touched on the FX volatility, meaning not assuming in the guide that the high levels will\npersist, which is a good conservative approach.

And I covered a number of items that impacted that, in\n\naddition to FX, higher volatility, and some offsets there that you mentioned. Happy to give you more color on those. But let me hit to your second point, which is\nour expectations on the full-year on pricing. Just to remind everyone, at the start of the year, we said we would anticipate that the pricing contribution to growth in\nthe full year would be similar to the previous year, but the timing would be a little bit different, where we'd have more back-end loaded pricing.

As you said, US volume inbound could have a higher yield, but we haven't\nnecessarily heard you call out hedging much before in the business, and would assume that FX vol benefits would have been more of an offset.

And so that 3 point delta, you could think the big portion of that is FX. And then to your point, higher volatility, which we\nsaid in April was a -- with higher in Q2 and throughout April. The two items, which I could give a little bit more color on. I called out client mix and hedging. So\nclient mix, we obviously have different clients throughout the portfolio there and different clients have different pricing and different yield dynamics. And so it really\ndepends on specific client performance and which clients are growing and where, and that could have an impact on our revenue yield. And in this case, it was a\nbit of a drag against the -- against relative to the 13% constant currency volume growth. And then on hedging, we hedge a portion of our cash flow exposures.\nThis quarter, we did have a gain in Q2. We had a year-over-year gain related to that hedging, but it was lower than the gain that we recognized a year ago in Q2.\nAnd so that became -- even though there was a gain, it was a drag, again it was a reconciling item between the two, the 13% and the 10%. So those are the two\nitems that primarily offset the higher volatility that we recognized in international transaction revenue. And then your second question, Darrin, on de minimis, if we\nlook at -- if we look at sort of the whole situation with China, so far, we're not seeing a material impact from tariffs related to China and specifically spend\nassociated with the de minimis exemption, it's just not a material portion of our volumes and we wouldn't expect any material impact.", "char_count": 1770, "word_count": 324, "token_count": 398, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

And so that diversification helps us. And so if there was a downturn, I\nthink our performance during this potential economic slowdown we would be resilient, and it can impact our business. If you think about it, between volumes and\nrevenue, volumes historically grown faster than PC. Even if PC slows, we're confident that we can continue to grow faster than that for all the reasons I spoke\nabout. And then the one other thing I'd add is on the revenue front, remember that incentives are largely variable. And so to the extent that volume growth does\nget impacted, there could be an offset on incentives. On the expense side, I think we've also historically shown we could flex our expenses. We could make -- we\nobviously want to balance between short and near-term and long-term priorities. We don't want to overreact to anything. We want to be thoughtful about making\nsure that we're investing in the right areas to ensure that Visa is successful over the long term, but we do have levers, and this is a management team that stands\nready to act.", "char_count": 2372, "word_count": 417, "token_count": 511, "exchange_id": "ex_006", "exchange_role": "question"}

Please go ahead.\nRamsey El-Assal\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. Stablecoin seem to be having their moment, maybe helped along by clear regulations. I know you called out your strategy\nthere, including this -- reaching $200 million of settlement flows. What are your latest thoughts on the demand for those stablecoin settlements or other stablecoin\npayments? Are you seeing or expecting an inflection? What are your clients saying? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney\nIt's still early, but we do see real potential, which is why we've been investing in the crypto space broadly in the stablecoin space specifically for many years now.\nWe've built up a team of real experts that I think are very well-respected among the ecosystem. But it's early. On the one hand, $200 million is a great kind of\nmilestone. On the other hand, it's still a relatively very small portion of our overall settlement volume. I guess I'd say a couple of things. One is, we are optimistic\nabout the kind of the US government passing more clear and pragmatic regulations. I think not just in the US, but hopefully other countries as well. We are\ncontinuing to push forward with the settlement work that you mentioned, but we're also exploring an kind of a broader set of product opportunities and\npartnerships in the stablecoin space. I might use that as a little bit of a pitch to join our product drop tomorrow, which I mentioned in my prepared remarks, but our\nteam will talk about some of those things as well. So as you said, there's a lot of activity and discussion about the stablecoin space right now. I think the tipping\npoint will be more clear and pragmatic regulations. But I do think in the big scheme of things, certainly as it relates to our broader business, it's still very early in\nthe development.", "char_count": 1868, "word_count": 324, "token_count": 407, "exchange_id": "ex_006", "exchange_role": "answer"}

Ryan, Visa has managed government nationalism risk for decades as a company. How do you think about navigating that risk in the current\nenvironment, being a US-based company operating globally during trade disputes? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney\nThanks. If I heard your question right, around how are we navigating all of this? We regularly engage with governments and regulators in every country where we\noperate. We have a like a world-class government engagement team in all of our regions and all of our major countries, but it's also our country managers, day-in\nand day-out, they are deeply engaged with the governments and the countries in which we operate because we are an extraordinarily important partner and\ncompany in every country we operate around the world. And our engagement now is -- it's important. It's as important as it's ever been, given the challenging and\nuncertain environment that you mentioned. What I would say is nationalism is nothing new. As long as we are permitted to operate in a country or territory, even if\nit's been more difficult for us to operate there than it has historically, we have a proven track record of being successful. We're used to operating in highly\nregulated markets and environments around the world. We've got tailored strategies, which we've tested in other markets with similar conditions, and we tailor\nthose to the unique needs of our clients and our partners in every one of these markets. And we're working with our clients and partners to regularly educate the\ngovernment and the regulators and the elected officials in those countries about not just what matters most kind of domestically in their market, but the\ncomplexities of the global payments market and what we need to be doing together to help them in their markets. So it is as complicated as I remember it, but we\nhave the experience, the people, the products and services to put to work in these countries around the world, and we feel good about our ability to navigate it.", "char_count": 2015, "word_count": 340, "token_count": 402, "exchange_id": "ex_007", "exchange_role": "question"}
