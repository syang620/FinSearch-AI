These statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results could differ materially as a\nresult of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent reports on\nForms 10-Q and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. Our comments today regarding our financial\nresults will reflect revenue on a GAAP basis and all other results on a non-GAAP nominal basis unless otherwise noted. The related GAAP measures and\nreconciliation are available in today's earnings release and related materials available on our IR website. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\nRyan McInerney\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge last night's tragic air collision in Washington, DC. \nOur hearts go out to all those affected by this terrible event, particularly the families and friends of the victims. Turning now to our results. We had a strong start to \nour fiscal year with $9.5 billion in net revenue, up 10% year-over-year, and EPS up 14%. Our key business drivers improved from the fourth quarter. In constant \ndollars, overall payments volume grew 9% year-over-year, US payments volume grew 7%, and international payments volume grew 11%. Cross-border volume \nexcluding Intra-Europe rose 16% in constant dollars, and processed transactions grew 11% year-over-year. Our strategy across consumer payments, new flows, \nand value-added services continues to resonate with our clients and is reflected in our business results. Back in February 2020, when we articulated our strategy, \nour total first quarter volume on our network had just crossed $3 trillion. Just five years later, our total quarterly volume was above $4 trillion. At the same time, \nCEMEA and Latin America had more volume from people using their cards to get cash than to make payments. Five years later, as a result of double-digit \nconstant dollar payments volume growth in both regions, the situation has flipped and we now have more than 60% of our volume from digital payments. I'm \nlooking forward to our Investor Day next month to discuss our strategy and our plans for future growth. For now, let's look at some of the quarterly highlights that \nhave helped to deliver this impressive progress. In consumer [payments] (ph), we now have 4.7 billion credentials, up 7% year-over-year, and 12.6 billion tokens, \nup 44% year-over-year. We continue to grow our credentials in an increasingly digital world. Interest in our Visa Flexible Credential continues to grow. We have \nnow launched with the Affirm Card in the US, expanded the funding options with SMCC in Japan by adding small business cards and announced a multi-currency \nsolution with fintech Liv in the UAE. Tap to Add Card is now live in the US for nearly 60% of all Visa consumer credit and debit cards. Since the launch, millions \nhave added their cards to their wallets by tapping, eliminating the overwhelming majority of provisioning fraud as compared to manual entry into a phone. And \n74% of all face-to-face transactions are now Tap to Pay. A few countries I would like to call out: Japan, where Tap to Pay penetration grew 20 percentage points \nsince last year to 44%; Argentina, where Tap to Pay penetration was up 22 percentage points to 78%; and the US, where it was up 13 percentage points to 57%. \nSeveral key initiatives contributed to the growth in these countries, including targeted marketing campaigns, the launch of transit acceptance in certain cities, and \nincreased issuance of Tap to Pay-enabled credentials. Finally, Tap to Phone is now live in 118 markets, and in the last year, the number of phones enabled has \nmore than doubled and the number of transactions has more than tripled. Now, let me turn to a few deal highlights from across the globe. First, in Mainland \nChina, we renewed our partnership with ICBC, the largest bank in the world in terms of assets and the biggest credit card issuer in Mainland China in terms of \nnumber of cards. In India, we renewed our long-standing credit agreement with ICICI Bank, SBI Card and Kotak Mahindra Bank, three of our largest issuers in the \ncountry with a focus on growing affluent and cross-border volume. We also renewed our debit agreement with Kotak Mahindra Bank. Also in our Asia-Pacific \nregion, we signed a long-term renewal with Bank of New Zealand, one of the largest banks in the country across consumer debit, consumer credit and business \ncredit. In Argentina and Uruguay, we renewed our portfolios with Santander for a long-term agreement with a focus on growing affluent. Also in Latin America, we \nhave deepened our partnership with BAC to grow acceptance with a goal to enable 300,000 nano and small merchants and to grow in new verticals. We also won \nthe issuance of their largely cross-border credit portfolio, Millas Plus, offering our expertise and value-added services. Similarly, in Brazil, we extended our \npartnership with digital bank Neon, which includes the launch of a new credit portfolio. We are also pleased to have renewed a pan-European agreement with \nBNP Paribas, which also includes the winning of additional portfolios in France and Belgium. When we talk about the total addressable opportunity in consumer \npayments, we often talk about the opportunity to win share from domestic networks. And we are continuing to have success converting credentials from domestic \nnetworks to Visa. In Bangladesh, we secured nearly 6 million credentials with Dutch-Bangla Bank from their closed-loop system. And Banco Popular de Puerto \nRico, the largest issuer and acquirer in Puerto Rico, renewed a multi-year credit and debit partnership with Visa that aims to expand digital penetration in the \ncountry through the launch of new products, including a co-badge card with a local network. And we've renewed our business with RBC Royal Bank in 10 \ncountries across the Caribbean, and we also expanded our relationship to include the transfer of debit credentials in the Dutch Caribbean to Visa and are \nsupporting the development of new credit and commercial products. And co-brand cards remain a key area of strength for us and this quarter was no exception.", "char_count": 6871, "word_count": 1117, "token_count": 1438, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

Second, the HSBC Taj credit card, India's first premium co-branded hospitality credit card. In our CEMEA region, we signed with real estate developer, \ninvestor and manager Aldar for a co-brand card for its Darna Rewards by Aldar loyalty program in the UAE with issuing bank Emirates NBD. We also launched a \nnew co-brand card in Saudi Arabia with Alrajhi Bank, and Marriott Bonvoy, the global travel program by Marriott International. In the airline category, we won the \nportfolio for EGYPTAIR, Africa's second largest airline. We also expanded our business in the SWISS card Miles & More program. And in the retail segment, we \nsigned with Casas Bahia, one of the top retailers in Brazil for co-brand cards, and with Bolt, a leading ride-hailing and food delivery operator in Ukraine. So, \nthrough traditional issuance, winning share from domestic networks, and leveraging our brand, products and innovation to secure important co-brands, our \nconsumer payments business is strong. Now to new flows, where revenue grew 19% year-over-year in constant dollars. Visa Direct has now crossed the 10 \nbillion transaction mark over the last 12 months with nearly 3 billion transactions this quarter. We continue to expand Visa Direct in several ways, one of which is \nbuilding and deepening partnerships directly with issuers and fintechs. We are excited to partner with X Money for their much-anticipated launch of the X Money \naccount, including P2P payment functionality set for later this year. Through the partnership, X Money will utilize Visa Direct to enable secure and instant funding\n\nof their X Wallet with a user's debit card. Users will also have the option to instantly transfer funds back into their bank account via the same debit card. This\nquarter, we signed an agreement with OnePay, a fintech company with more than 3 million monthly active users for Visa Direct as the engine for wallet loads. In\nEcuador, Banco Pichincha, one of the country's largest issuers, will begin using Visa Direct for cross-border remittance payments. Our broad and deep\ncross-border capabilities continue to be important differentiators, and this quarter, Libra Internet Bank in Romania launched a real-time multi-currency FX service\nfor their business customers utilizing our Currencycloud solution. In Asia-Pacific, OCBC has launched a cross-border P2P solution on the OCBC app, allowing\ntheir customers in Singapore to send money to Chinese wallets using Visa Direct, all they need is the recipient's China national ID name and mobile number.\nNow, moving to commercial, where volumes were up 6% year-over-year this quarter in constant dollars, we had some notable progress in specific verticals. First,\nin the food and grocery delivery vertical, we had two recent wins. In the US, we are pleased that DoorDash's shopper card program will soon be using Visa Virtual\nCommercial credit cards to enable Dashers to pay for customer orders at physical merchant outlets. This is in addition to our Visa Direct relationship with\nDoorDash in the US, Australia and Canada to enable Dasher payouts. In Brazil, we signed a commercial business card deal for commercial customers of iFood\nPago, the fintech for the largest food delivery platform in the country. In the healthcare vertical, we reached a virtual card agreement with an insurtech company in\nFrance, mySofie, offering medical policyholders an easy way to pay for their healthcare. In the T&E vertical, we recently renewed and deepened our partnership\nwith Airwallex, a global financial platform enabling more than 150,000 businesses to manage payments and money movement across borders. Today, Visa and\nAirwallex have live card programs in Australia, Hong Kong, the UK, United States, Canada, Netherlands and Singapore to enable businesses to easily make\ndigital card payments around the world, and soon, we will be expanding to new geographies across our use cases in expense cards and B2B travel. In both Visa\nDirect and commercial, we continued to develop innovative new solutions and use cases that helped us retain and secure business. Now to value-added\nservices, where in the first quarter, revenue grew 18% in constant dollars. Across our solutions, we continue to grow revenue as we enhance Visa payments,\nenable services for all types of payments, and go beyond payments. We often partner with acquirers who utilize Visa's Acceptance Platform to offer their\nmerchant clients compelling solutions. When this happens, we generate revenue on both Visa and non-Visa transactions. Three examples this quarter are\nEuropean acquirer emerchantpay, Guatemalan acquirer NeoNet, and Paraguayan acquirer Bancard, who will all offer Cybersource to their merchants. We are\nalso partnering with Fiserv to include our Cybersource gateway as a solution for their acquirers and merchants in Europe and Asia-Pacific. This is in addition to\nFiserv expanding their use of cardholder authentication from CardinalCommerce to further extend our global partnership into additional Fiserv platforms. In our\nrisk solutions, in 2024, we launched Visa Protect for A2A payments, with plans to expand to 10 new RTP networks in 2025. Powered by AI-based fraud detection\nmodels, this new service provides a real-time risk score that can be used to identify fraud on account-to-account payments. We are now piloting the solution with\nfive significant players in Brazil, who represent more than 20% of Pix transactions. We are also very pleased to have closed our acquisition of Featurespace,\nenabling us to provide an expanded set of fraud prevention tools to our clients and protect consumers in real time across various payment methods. In advisory\nservices, we continue to see strong demand. One example of a recent project is with Alrajhi Bank, where we are expanding our advisory relationship into risk,\ndigital enablement, and data analysis across their portfolios. So, across our value-added services portfolio, we are innovating with new solutions and deepening\nour partnerships with clients to drive growth. To wrap it up, we began our fiscal year with strong performance, an ever-growing obsession for our clients, and a\nfocus on continued innovation as we build the future of payments. I look forward to seeing you in February at our Investor Day. And now, over to Chris.", "char_count": 6314, "word_count": 996, "token_count": 1313, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

Good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results reflected improving underlying drivers and effective execution of our business. In constant \ndollars, global payments volume was up 9% year-over-year, and cross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe, was up 16% year-over-year. Processed \ntransactions grew 11% year-over-year. Fiscal first quarter net revenue was up 10%, higher than our expectations, primarily due to strong international transaction \nrevenue and value-added services revenue. Net revenue was up 11% in constant dollars. EPS was up 14% year-over-year and 15% in constant dollars, higher \nthan expected, primarily due to revenue outperformance and a lower-than-expected tax rate. Now, let's go into the details. In the US, total payments volume grew \n7% year-over-year, up 2 points from Q4. Credit grew 7% and debit grew 8%. The US benefited from a strong holiday shopping season, which is the period from \nNovember 1st through December 31st and the lapping of the impact of Reg II implementations, which had a modest drag in Q1 of last year. In the US, consumer \nholiday spending growth was in the upper mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. The consumer categories with the strongest growth were discretionary \ncategories, such as retail, travel and entertainment. Focusing on retail, holiday spending growth was a couple of points higher than last year, and retail spending \ngrowth on key shopping days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday was several points higher. E-commerce was a higher share of retail holiday spending versus \nlast year. In key countries around the globe, we saw similar trends with consumer retail holiday spending growth improving from last year. Moving to international \nmarkets, total payments volume was up 11% in constant dollars, up from Q4. In most of our regions, payments volume year-over-year growth rates in constant \ndollars were strong for the quarter, with Latin America up 22%, CEMEA up 18%, and Europe up 13%. Asia-Pacific payments volume growth saw a slight \nimprovement from Q4 in constant dollars to just above 1% year-over-year for the quarter, reflecting a still somewhat muted macroeconomic environment. Now to \ncross-border volume, which I'll speak to in constant dollars and excluding Intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume was up 16% year-over-year in Q1, \n3 points above Q4. E-commerce, measured as card-not-present volume ex travel and cross-border travel volume, were both up 16% year-over-year for Q1. \nE-commerce volumes continued to benefit from the strength in retail in part due to the strong holiday shopping season. Travel volumes performed well across our \nregional corridors due to broader strength in both consumer and commercial spending. Outbound Europe and Asia-Pacific travel volume growth also benefited \nfrom solid performance of client portfolios. For the US, both outbound e-commerce and travel volume growth were also helped by the strong dollar. Now, let's \nreview our first quarter financial results. I'll start with the revenue components. Service revenue grew 8% year-over-year versus the 8% growth in Q4 constant \ndollars payments volume. Data processing revenue grew 9% versus 11% processed transaction growth, due largely to the back-half loaded 2025 pricing impact \nthat was included in our initial guidance. Had pricing been more evenly spread across the year, as in the prior year, these two growth metrics would have been \nmore in line for the first quarter. International transaction revenue was better than expected, benefiting from higher cross-border volumes and higher currency \nvolatility than we expected. Year-over-year growth was up 14%, below the 16% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe due \nprimarily to foreign exchange and lapping higher currency volatility from last year. Other revenue grew 32%, primarily driven by better-than-expected consulting \nand marketing services growth and select pricing modifications. Client incentives grew 13%, reflecting a strong renewal quarter. Now, to our three growth \nengines. Consumer payments revenue growth was driven by improving payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transaction growth. New flows \nrevenue grew 19% year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by better-than-expected commercial cross-border performance across all regions and Visa Direct \ntransaction growth. Commercial payments volume rose 6% year-over-year in constant dollars, mainly driven by favorable days mix impact as well as strong \ncross-border volumes. Visa Direct transactions grew 34% year-over-year, helped by growth in Latin America for interoperability among P2P apps. Value-added \nservices revenue grew to $2.4 billion, a growth rate of 18% in constant dollars, led by strong growth in consulting and marketing services, issuing solutions, and \nrisk and identity solutions. Operating expenses grew 11%, in line with our expectations, driven by increases in personnel and general and administrative \nexpenses. In our GAAP results, we had $213 million in severance costs related to changes to our workforce, reflecting our efforts to focus investment on the \nhighest growth opportunities for our business as well as accelerating our innovation to better serve our clients. Our tax rate was 17.7%, better than expected due \nto various items, including a change in our geographic mix of earnings. EPS was $2.75, up 14% over last year, with an approximately 1-point drag from exchange \nrates and an approximately 0.5-point drag from acquisitions. In Q1, we bought back approximately $3.9 billion in stock and distributed $1.2 billion in dividends to\n\nour stockholders. At the end of December, we had $9.1 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Now, let's move to what we've seen so far in Q2. Through\nJanuary 28th, driver trends have remained strong. US payments volume was up 8%, with debit up 9% and credit up 7% year-over-year. Processed transactions\ngrew 11% year-over-year. For constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, we saw total volume grew 17% year-over-year,\ntravel-related cross-border volume grew 17% year-over-year, and cross-border card-not-present ex-travel volume grew 16%. Now, on to our expectations.\nRemember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our\nearnings presentation for more detail. For the second quarter, we expect adjusted net revenue growth to be in the high-single-digits to low-double-digits. I would\nnote that the primary difference between Q1 and Q2 adjusted net revenue growth is the lapping of leap year. We expect second quarter adjusted operating\nexpense growth to be in the high-single to low-double-digits. Non-operating income in the second quarter is expected to be negligible. And our tax rate in the\nsecond quarter is expected to be around 17.5%. As a result, we expect second quarter adjusted EPS growth to be in the high-single-digits. We have now closed\nthe acquisition of Featurespace and lapped the impact of Pismo in January. For acquisition impacts, we expect a minimal impact to net revenue growth and\napproximately 1.5-point contribution to operating expense growth and an approximately 0.5-point headwind to EPS growth in the second quarter. Now, let's cover\nour full year expectations. We now expect full year adjusted net revenue growth to be in the low-double-digits. There are no material changes to our adjusted\noperating expense growth and non-operating income expectations for the full year. Based on our lower-than-expected tax rate in Q1 and an updated view for the\nrest of the year, we're lowering our expected tax rate to be between 17.5% and 18%. Taking all of this together, we now expect adjusted EPS growth to be in the\nlow teens. Featurespace and Pismo are expected to have a minimal impact on full year net revenue growth and approximately 1 point contribution to operating\nexpense growth and an approximately 0.5-point headwind to EPS growth. In summary, we're off to a strong start to the year. We remain focused on the execution\nof our growth strategy for the rest of 2025 and look forward to Investor Day in a few weeks.

Cross-border,\nmaybe the added commentary on cross-border was, if you look at e-commerce, e-commerce was up 1 point from Q4, cross-border e-commerce, benefiting from\nthe stronger retail and holiday, and then travel though did step-up by 4 points from Q4, and not just Q4, but maybe the last two quarters, which had been around\nthat same level. We're seeing strong travel results from across all the regions. And so, again, we feel really good about that.

Okay. Let me try to tackle all three of those things, Darrin. In terms of the full year guide, you are recalling correctly, when we started the year, we talked\nabout sort of the dynamics in half-one and half-two and why we anticipated growth to be accelerating throughout the course of the year. Incentives was part of\nthat story. We are, as we said before, as expected, this is going to be a big year for renewals with more than 20% of our payment volume impacted and starting\nreally meaningfully with that renewal cycle in the first half of the year, that has occurred. You saw incentives grow 13% in Q1 versus the 6% we saw in Q4, that\nwill continue. We anticipate Q2 incentives growth will continue to reflect that renewal cycle. You mentioned Reg II.

And going forward, as we think\nabout greater opportunities in that area, should we think about Visa maybe emphasizing some more security offerings versus processing and gateway? Just\ntrying to frame that up.\nRyan McInerney\nYeah. We continue to be very excited about the progress that we're making in value-added services across the board. There's no change in emphasis as it\nrelates to the priority or the prioritization of kind of the areas where we've been building products and serving clients. So, we continue to be very focused on\ndelivering solutions to merchants and acquirers, very focused on delivering solutions to issuers, very focused on delivering fraud and risk solutions broadly across\nthe ecosystem, as well as our advisory business, I talked about some examples in my prepared remarks. We have had some great acquisitions. The way that we\nthink about acquisitions is we're constantly, kind of, looking for companies around the world that we can bring into our ecosystem, accelerate their growth,\naccelerate our kind of, products that we're bringing to our clients, and Pismo and Featurespace are two great examples of those. In terms of Pismo, we're having\nreal good success, kind of, with our sales pipeline all around the world. We're having conversations with clients that I don't think Pismo ever would have had\ncertainly not this early in their evolution. And the reason we're able to do that is we're bringing, kind of, the amazing capabilities that Pismo offers together with the\ndeep relationships and partnerships that we have as well as kind of our long track record of delivering resilient solutions to our clients and partners. Featurespace\nis early, but we're already having a ton of success. I got a ton of great client and partner feedback once we closed that acquisition. We've known Featurespace for\nmany, many years. We partnered with them. We also competed against them. We know their capabilities really, really well. One of the things that you're seeing\nfrom us is that we're continuing to take the amazing capabilities that we have at Visa, whether that's our fraud capabilities, our network capabilities, our\nprocessing capabilities, we're unbundling those from the Visa stack, we're enhancing them, and then we're delivering them to a broader array of clients and\npartners, many times unrelated to Visa transactions or the VisaNet platform itself. So we continue to focus on all those areas in value-added service. We continue\nto have good success.

So, Ryan, I want to follow up on your comments on kind of this unbundling of the capabilities and ask about Visa A2A. You talked about 10 new\nRTP network partnerships. What are you hearing from your issuer and merchant customers, Bill Pay is probably an obvious use case. How should we think about\nthe roadmap of use cases, monetization models and also the dynamics vis-a-vis debit in terms of cannibalization? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney\nYeah. You're right. And this notion of unbundling our capabilities is very relevant in the value-added services space for some of the reasons that I mentioned. It's\nalso very relevant in the consumer payment space and Visa Account-to-Account is a great example. A great example where we've unbundled, kind of, our brand\nand acceptance, our rules in terms of chargebacks, disputes, and returns, and how things work, as well as kind of our risk management capabilities. We've\nunbundled that from the Visa stack and now we're delivering that to our partners initially in the UK with Visa A2A and then more broadly across Europe and other\nplaces over time. We still are on track to launch Visa A2A in early 2025. After we announced it, we've done what we always do, which is have a bunch of great\nconversations with clients and partners and regulators in the UK. As you mentioned, the initial use case is targeted at Bill Pay, and what we found through those\nconversations is there's a real need. There is a real need to add the types of processes and rules and the trusted brand that we have to account-to-account\npayments starting in Bill Pay to give consumers more confidence to use it, merchants more reason and confidence to offer it, and we're excited about it. I mean,\nobviously, Bill Pay in UK is just the start, but we think that the power of, kind of, taking some of these Visa capabilities into the account-to-account space is going\nto be a great benefit for our clients and our partners in the ecosystem. You mentioned Visa Account-to-Account, it's a similar story, kind of, on what we've been\ndoing in Account-to-Account Protect, where we've taken our kind of decades of risk experience, our data, our scoring algorithms and unbundled that from, kind of,\nthe Visa stack and we're delivering that to, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're targeting up to 10 RTP networks during the course of this year. I mentioned\nthe banks we're now working with in Brazil to reduce fraud on Pix transactions. We've had great success with Pay.UK in the UK, reducing fraud on\naccount-to-account transactions. And you're going to hear a lot more on -- from other partners and other networks around the world. These two examples are\nboth driven by client needs. I mean that is what drives our innovation agenda, that's what drives our product delivery agenda. We've been hearing from clients all\naround the world that they're looking for Visa to help them with these types of challenges, both driving account -- safe and secure account-to-account payments\naround the world.

I wanted to touch on tokenization for a minute. I think you said number of tokens were up 44% in the quarter. Obviously, a pretty robust number.\nSo, if you can just give us a general update on tokenization strategy and any potential timing or magnitude of actual monetization opportunity from tokenization?\nObviously, understanding the benefits of it from a fraud and security perspective, but just wondering if there's any direct monetization we should be thinking\nabout.\nRyan McInerney\nHappy to talk about tokens. You did get the number right and we agree that it's significant. Let me just step back and maybe put the whole token kind of roadmap\nin perspective. Visa network tokens have been and will be one of our most important investment priorities across the company. We -- in many ways, we led the\nwave of token innovation and adoption. It's been -- I think it's been about a decade since we issued the first Visa token. And I remember, I think in 2020, we got to\n1 billion tokens. And that was a big milestone. But in hindsight, like we were really just approaching the beginning of the steep part of the S-curve. You go back to\nwhat you said about 44% growth. So, we've now got more than 12.5 billion tokens across the ecosystem. We got 8,400 issuers around the world that are issuing\nthem in 200-plus markets around the world. And we've got a third of all Visa transactions that are now tokenized. We did 21 billion, 22 billion token transactions in\nthe last quarter. And as you alluded to, the adoption is proliferating because the performance improvement is meaningful. If you just look at e-commerce, on\ntokenized transactions, we have 6 percentage point higher approval rates. That is significantly higher sales for our merchant partners, and 30% reduction in fraud\nrates, which is good for everybody in the ecosystem. It's also -- tokens have become one of our most important platforms for enabling innovation. For example, I\nthink it was last quarter I talked about in Europe, we're using tokens to simplify the e-commerce checkout experience. We've embedded FIDO pass keys via Visa\ntokens into Click to Pay, and we're making e-commerce checkout as easy as it is that you and I unlock our phone with our face or fingerprint. So that's an\nexample of tokens being a platform to drive innovation around the world. They're also a critical enabler of our value-added services. And those we deepen\nrelationships with our partners and we also grow revenue. To your question around monetization, what would be a couple of examples? We've got merchants that\nare using our token credential enrichment service. So, we embed this in Visa tokens, so that we continually update Visa credentials for merchants that subscribe\nto this service, and then they don't have to worry about consumers updating their credentials when their cards expire, so they don't miss a subscription renewal or\na sale, and we are revenue for that service. We also offer a service, if you think about on the issuer side, that allows our issuers to create a heatmap of all their\nconsumers' tokens across the entire ecosystem. And they pay for this service from us so that they can enable their customers to add, view and manage their Visa\ncards across merchants that they use in their daily lives. So, we have a vast array of services that we both ship and that we're building and plan to ship built on\nour tokens. And the revenue that we generate from these token-enabled services is meaningful, and it will be even more meaningful going forward.", "char_count": 3542, "word_count": 612, "token_count": 759, "exchange_id": "ex_005", "exchange_role": "question"}

I was wondering if you could just speak to the point around the strength of the dollar and really like the purchasing power parity associated with that. So\nfor -- I guess it plays into cross-border, obviously for outbound US, but higher for people to come into the United States, but also just in terms of just spending\npatterns. I mean, obviously, this is going to be a strong period for a little while. And I'm just wondering to what extent there is a proportional benefit to your\nbusiness. Thank you.\nRyan McInerney\nYeah. I mean clearly, the dollar has strengthened meaningfully and quickly. You got it right, which is all else equal with a stronger dollar, you have stronger\npurchasing power for Americans outside of America. In kind of historical periods where we've had a stronger dollar, we have ultimately seen that lead to some\ntravel patterns for outbound from the US. The opposite of that is, obviously, it's more expensive for people to travel to the US. In kind of again historical periods of\nrelatively stronger dollars, we've seen some shift in travel patterns of people who might otherwise have traveled to the US going to other places around the world.\nHaving said that, it's still early. This particular situation we're going to have to monitor. And even though in past times, you have seen some changes in travel\ncorridors as a result of a strengthening dollar, we typically have seen the travel spending overall remain consistent. People just plan their holidays in different\nplaces around the world, but that takes time. We're only -- we're a pretty short period into this stronger dollar period so far. So, assuming we stay at this point,\nwe'll be able to give you more insight next quarter and future quarters.", "char_count": 1741, "word_count": 300, "token_count": 364, "exchange_id": "ex_008", "exchange_role": "question"}

Hey, Chris. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask on the regulatory environment in the US.

I know there's a few\nthings going on in the US obviously. I'm curious how you're feeling. Thanks so much.\nRyan McInerney\nYeah. We're optimistic. Our clients are optimistic. And I think what we've heard so far is that the administration wants to move quickly to reduce and simplify\nregulations and they're doing it kind of with a goal of spurring economic growth, efficiency, innovation, all very good things. So, we're optimistic that these\nchanges are going to reduce the regulatory burden for businesses in general in America, which is good for America and ultimately should be good for Visa. We're\noptimistic as our clients are that they're going to reduce the regulatory burden, specifically in the financial sector, which will in turn help our FI clients accelerate\ndigital payments and, in general, run their businesses more efficiently and more effectively, which is very good for them, which is in turn good for us.

Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to some of the big deal renewals you discussed early in the call and ask about the interplay of the\ndifferent revenue lines in these renewals. What I'm trying to understand is, you're obviously making pricing concessions when you make these large -- when you\nenter into these large renewals or deal expansions. To what degree are you able to make-up for that with other revenue or VAS being sold into these issuers?\nAnd I know this is complicated, but how much is that accounting for the expansion we're seeing in some of the other revenue? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney\nYeah. First, just reflecting on this quarter, the last quarter, as you've seen, we've just been having great tremendous success with clients all over the world. And\nthey continue to choose Visa because of our brand, because of our products, because of our innovation, because of our people, but increasingly because of our\nvalue-added services and because of our CMS or new flows capabilities. And I guess, I would answer your question this way. When we engage and our teams\nengage with partners on these types of renewal extension, new business deals that you're talking about, it is vastly different than it was three or four years ago.\nThe types of conversations that we're having with our clients are much more multifaceted. They're very rich conversations about a broad array of services that we\ncan provide them, one of which is, of course, network services for their debit cards and credit cards. But in a much more significant way, we're having\nconversations about processing, about services, about fraud and risk services, about ways that as part of a multifaceted agreement we can expand from historical\nrelationships in consumer payments to small-business cards, commercial cards, fleet-specific priorities -- I'm sorry, specific priorities around fleet, for example, or\naround agricultural verticals or different types of B2B verticals. It's just a -- it's a very different sales motion. It's a very different type of negotiation, but importantly,\nas you alluded to, it involves a lot of different revenue levers than we historically would have had. So, it varies from client to client and market to market and\nwhat's important to them, but our teams are increasingly having success building on deep relationships historically in consumer payments and taking the\nopportunity of these renewals to really expand our partnerships, especially into new flows opportunities, into VAS opportunities, deepening our relationship with\nthose partners and creating new revenue growth opportunities.", "char_count": 2624, "word_count": 426, "token_count": 533, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

Thank you. Does the news this week on DeepSeek influence how you're thinking about your business strategy, possibly in terms of whether you're thinking\nabout stepping up the usage of AI to help with managing internal cost or maybe in terms of whether you're thinking about using AI as a tool to support your growth\nand unlock new revenue opportunities? Because it does appear from an outsider's perspective, AI potentially could help improve operating efficiency and might\neven perhaps support some of your revenue areas like authorization or fraud prevention. So, wanted to ask you for your view on what DeepSeek and the rise of\nAI generally means for Visa as far as strategy and where do you see opportunity going forward? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney\nYeah, we agree with you. Everything that's happening in the world, whether it's DeepSeek or the many, many things that have happened before or will happen \nafter it, all are examples of opportunities for us broadly across Visa. We were very early adopters of artificial intelligence and we continue to drive hard at the \nadoption of generative AI as we have for the last couple of years. So, we've been working to embed AI and AI tooling into our company's operations, I guess, \nbroadly we've seen material gains in productivity, particularly in our engineering teams. We've deployed AI tooling in client services, sales, finance, marketing, \nreally everywhere across the company. And we were a very early adopter of applied AI in the analytics and modeling space. Very early by like decades, we've\n\nbeen using AI in that space. So, our data science and risk management teams have, at this point, decades of applied experience with AI and they're aggressively\nadopting the current generations of AI technology to enhance both our internal and our market-facing predictive and detective modeling capabilities. Our product\nteams are also aggressively adopting GAI to build and ship new products. I think I talked last quarter about data tokens, that's a great example. And just as the\nInternet itself fundamentally changed the way that we all shop and buy and the way commerce works itself, we deeply believe that AI is going to be a driving force\nthat is going to change the way digital commerce works. And we have an amazing team of people that are working really hard to ensure that Visa plays a central\nand sustainable role in the next version of digital commerce, and I think we'll have more to say about that in future quarters.", "char_count": 2487, "word_count": 419, "token_count": 505, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}
