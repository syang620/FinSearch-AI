{"doc_id": "TSLA_2025_Q1", "ticker": "TSLA", "year": 2025, "quarter": 1, "filing_date": "2025-03-01", "phase": "qa", "speaker_name": "Elon Musk", "speaker_role": "Unknown", "speaker_firm": null, "utterance_id": "u_0000", "utterance_type": "statement", "text": "Hello, everyone. Well, there\u2019s never a dull moment these days. Thanks for sure. Every day is going to be exciting. As some people know, there's been some \nblowback for the time that I've been spending in government with the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE. I think the work that we're doing there is \nactually very important for trying to sprain in the insane deficit that is leading our country, the United States, to destruction. And the DOGE team has made a lot of \nprogress in addressing waste and fraud. The natural blowback from that is those who were receiving the wasteful dollars and the fortunate dollars will try to attack \nme and DOGE team and anything associated with me. So, but then I'm really left with two choices. Should we just let the waste and fraud continue? And it was \ncontinuing at a -- to grow at a really unsustainable pace that was bankrupting the country or to fight the waste and fraud and try to get the country back on the \nright track. And I believe the right thing to do is to just fight the waste and fraud and get the country back on the right track and working together with President \nTrump and his administration. Because if the ship of America goes down, we all go down with it, including Tesla and everyone else. So, I think this is critical work. \nNow, the protests that you'll see out there, they're very organized, they're paid for. They're obviously not going to say, admit that the reason that they're protesting \nis because they're receiving fraudulent money or that they are the recipients of wasteful largesse, but they're going to come up with some other reason. But that is \n- the real reason for the protests, the actual reason is that those receiving the waste and fraud wish to continue receiving it. That is the real thing that's going on \nhere, obviously. So, now that said, I do think there's the large slug of work necessary to get the DOGE team in place and working in the government to get the \nfinancial house in order is mostly done. And I think starting probably next month, May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly. I'll have to continue \ndoing it for, I think, probably the remainder of the President's term, just to make sure that the waste and fraud that we stop does not come roaring back, which will \ndo if it has the chance. So, I think I'll continue to spend a day or two per week on government matters for as long as the President would like me to do so and as \nlong as it is useful. But starting next month, I'll be allocating probably more of my time to Tesla and now that the major work of establishing the Department of \nGovernment Efficiency is done. So, at Tesla, we've gone through many, many crises over the years and actually been through many near-death experiences. We \nwere probably on the ragged edge of death at least on maybe a dozen times. It's been so many times. This is not one of those times. We're not on the ragged \nedge of death, not even close. So -- but there are some challenges, and I expect that this year will be, there will probably be some unexpected bumps this year. \nBut I remain extremely optimistic about the future of the company. The future of the company is fundamentally based on large-scale autonomous cars and \nlarge-scale, large volume, vast numbers of autonomous humanoid robots. So the value of a company that makes truly useful autonomous humanoid robots and \nautonomous useful vehicles at scale at low cost, which is what Tesla is going to do, is staggering. I continue to believe that Tesla, with excellent execution, will be \nthe most valuable company in the world by far. But that's an important if, we must execute well. But if we do execute well, I think Tesla will be the most valuable \ncompany in the world by far. It may be as valuable as the next five companies combined. So, but there'll be a few bumps along the road before that happens. I \nsaid I think on the last earnings call that we'll start to see the prosperity of autonomy take effect in a material way around the middle of next year. We expect to \nhave these -- be selling fully autonomous rides in June in Austin, as we've been saying for now several months. So that's continued, but the real question from \nfinancial standpoint is when does it really become material and affect bottom line of the company and start to be a fundamental part of the -- when does it move \nthe financial needle in a significant way? That's probably around the middle of next year, second half of next year. And then once it does start to move the \nfinancial needle in a significant way, it will really go exponential from there. So that's, I'd encourage people to look beyond like the, some sort of bumps and \nbundles of each road immediately ahead of us. But left your gaze to the bright shining sort of down the hill, I don't know, some Reagan-esque imagery. And that's \nwhere we're headed and not too distant future. Like I said, kind of next year or two. So, let's see. With respect to supply chain risk, something that Tesla has been \nworking on for several years is to localize supply chains. This actually makes sense from a cost standpoint and from a logistics risk standpoint, is to have the \nsupply chains be at least located on the continent in which the car is built. And so we are, I think the least, a company, the least affected car company with \nrespect to tariffs, at least in most respects, I mean, it remains to be seen. Now, tariffs are still tough on a company when margins are still low. But we do have \nlocalized supply chains in North America, Europe, and China. So that puts us in a stronger position than any of our competitors. And undoubtedly, I'm going to get \na lot of questions about tariffs, and I just want to emphasize that the tariff decision is entirely up to the President of the United States. I will weigh in with my \nadvice with the President, which he will listen to my advice, but then it's up to him, of course, to make his decision. I've been on the record many times saying that \nI believe lower tariffs are generally a good idea for prosperity, but this decision is fundamentally up to the elected representative of the people being the President \nof the United States. So, you know, I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs, but that's all I can do. So, now let me walk you through why \nI'm so excited about the future of Tesla. So, first of all, autonomy. The team and I are laser focused on bringing robotaxi to Austin in June. Unsupervised \nautonomy will first be solved for the Model Y in Austin. And then -- actually you should parse out the terms robotic taxi or robotaxi and just generally like what's \nthe Cybercab because we've got a product called the Cybercab and then any Tesla which could be an S3 extra wide that is autonomous is a robotic taxi or \nrobotaxi. It's very confusing. So the vast majority of the Tesla fleet that we've made is capable of being a robotaxi or robotic taxi. And as we're going from -- once \nwe can make the whole system work where you can have paid rides fully autonomously with no one in the car in one city, that is a very scalable thing for us to go \nbroadly within whatever jurisdiction allows us to operate. So, because we're solving for is a general solution to autonomy, not a city specific solution for autonomy. \nOnce we make it work in a few cities, we can basically make it work in all cities in that legal jurisdiction. So, if it\u2019s -- once we can make it based to work in a few \ncities in America, we can make it work anywhere in America. Once we can make it work in a few cities in China, we can make it work anywhere in China, likewise \nin Europe, limited only by regulatory approvals. So, this is the advantage of having a generalized solution using artificial intelligence. And the -- an AI chip that \nTesla designed specifically for this purpose as opposed to very expensive sensors and high precision maps of a particular neighborhood where that neighborhood \nmay change or often changes and then the car stops working. So, we have a general solution instead of a specific solution. Then, with regards to Optimus, we\u2019re \nmaking good progress in Optimus. We expect to have thousands of Optimus robots working in Tesla factories by the end of this year, 10 years forward. And we \nexpect to scale Optimus up faster than any product, I think, in history, to get to millions of units per year as soon as possible. I think I feel confident in getting to a \nmillion units per year in less than five years, maybe five years. So, by 2030, I feel confident in predicting a million Optimus units per year, it might be 2029. So,\n\nlet's see with respect to energy, energy business is doing very well. The Megapack is -- enables utility companies to output far more total energy than would\notherwise be the case. When you think of the energy capability of a grid, it's much more than, say, total energy output per year. If the powerplants could operate\nat peak power for all 24 hours, as opposed to being at half power, sometimes a quarter power at night, then you could double the energy output of existing power\nplants. But in order to do that, you need to buffer the energy, so that you can charge up something like a battery pack at night and then discharge into the grid\nduring the day. So, this is a massive unlock on total energy output of any given grid over the course of a year. And utility companies are beginning to realize this\nand are buying in our Megapacks at scale. So, at this point, a gigawatt class battery is quite a common thing. So, we have many orders and offer for gigawatt and\nbeyond batteries. And we expect the energy -- the stationary energy storage business to scale ultimately to terawatts per year. So very, very good numbers. Now,\nQ1, first quarters of a year are usually pretty tricky. Because it's usually the worst quarter of the year because people don't want to go buy a car in the middle of\nwinter during the blizzard. So we picked Q1 as a good quarter to do a cutover to the new version of the Model Y and we changed production of the world's best\nselling cars with -- remember the Model Y is the best selling car of any kind on earth with a 1.1 billion unit per year output of a single model. And we did this\nchangeover at the same time in factories all across the world. So congratulations to the Tesla team on an amazing job in pulling off what is a very difficult\ntransition. So yeah, it's really very impressive work. So, yeah. In conclusion, while there are many near-term headwinds for us and the border industry, the future\nfor Tesla is brighter than ever. The value of the company is delivering sustainable abundance with our affordable AI powered robots. So this, I like this phrase,\nsustainable abundance for all. If you say, like, what's the ideal future that you can imagine? That's what you'd want. You'd want abundance for all in a way that's\nsustainable. It's good for the environment. Basically, this is the happy future. If you say what's the happiest future you can imagine. One which is that would be a\nfuture where there's sustainable abundance for all. Closest thing to heaven we can get on Earth, basically. So, thank you again to the test team for all their efforts\nof the challenging time. I look forward to continuing to lead the team to great success in the future.", "char_count": 11349, "word_count": 2060, "token_count": 2496, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

As Elon mentioned, in Q1, we achieved something which has never been undertaken in the automotive industry of updating all our factories for the\nbest-selling car in the world, all at the same time. And this is, people don't understand, this was not a small feat. We're not aware of anybody else being able to do\nthe best-selling car all at once within a quarter. And that too hitting all the timelines which we had established at the beginning. So, big kudos to the team for\nmaking this happen. Additionally, we also hit record gross profit for energy storage business in the quarter. Now, getting back into the business, there has been a\nlot of speculation as to the reasons for decline of our vehicle deliveries in the first quarter. We had previously guided that we will be updating all factories and this\nwill lead to several weeks of lost production, which did happen as planned. The ripple effect of the change is not having enough new Model Y available in most\nmarkets for people to see and experience till the last few weeks of the quarter. Additionally, the negative impact of vandalism and unwanted hostility towards our\nbrand and our people had an impact in certain markets. Despite this, we were able to sell out legacy Model Y in US, China, and a few other markets within the\nworld. And again, just so that people understand, we were producing the legacy Model Y till middle to end of February. And we switched over and we were able to\nstill sell out within that period. So, again, big achievement by all the people at Tesla to make it happen. We've been extremely -- we have a very extremely\ncompetitive vehicle lineup, which with most vehicles going through a recent update, and add to that, if it wants an FSD, you have a personal chauffeur which can\ntake you almost anywhere under supervision. There are numerous stories shared by customers ranging from how it has improved their daily commute, to\nproviding mobility to customers with disabilities, to giving older customers the ability to travel comfortably and independently. Not only is FSD Supervised safer\nthan a human driver, but it is also improving the lives of individuals who experience it. And again, this is something you have to experience, and anybody who has\nexperience just knows it. And we've been doing a lot lately to try and get those stories out, at least on X, so that people can see how other people have benefited\nfrom this. Now, coming into some of the financial stuff, auto margins declined sequentially primarily due to a reduction in the total number of deliveries, lower fixed\ncost absorption due to factory change awards and lower regulatory credit revenues offset by a slight increase in pricing due to the launch of new Model Y despite\nincentives which we had to sell legacy Model Y. Our energy storage business, like I said before, has achieved yet another milestone of create highest gross profit\nin the quarter. This was despite sequential decline in deployments. The importance of this business, as Elon mentioned, is pretty profound, especially in this\nenvironment. Because, in order for our grid to work properly with the demands from AI and all this, you need some more stability. This is by far the simplest and\nbest solution, which we are aware of, which can help do this. And we've also developed certain unique solutions to help our customers to achieve this.\nAdditionally, on the Powerwall side, we've been selling the new Powerwall 3, and it's been received with very good reception from customers, and to the extent\nthat we are currently supply constraint. On services and other margins, they were slightly down sequentially, primarily because of the pressure on our used car\nbusiness and insurance business. Note that we continued our journey to improve profitability in our services and collision business through better labor\nproductivity. As previously discussed, our operating expenses continue to increase sequentially, primarily due to our AI-related initiatives, including Optimus, and\nalso cost of development for our vehicle programs, including Cybercabs, SEMA, and cheaper models. These expenses flow through R&D. We believe even in the\ncurrent environment, it is the right strategy, in making investments in these areas to position us for the long term. These increases were offset by decreases in\nSG&A changes in our vertical effort program. Other income reduced significantly on a sequential basis. The primary reason was Bitcoin mark to market loss in Q1\nversus gain in Q4, resulting in a $472 million drop. The remainder of the change is because of FX reimbursement. With the adoption of the new mark to market\nstandard for Bitcoin, we expect increased volatility in other income in addition to the FX volatility. I know tariffs is the hottest topic which people talk about and it\nhas various impacts to our business. And as Elon mentioned, on the vehicle business, we've been on this journey of regionalization for years. Specifically in the\nUS, Model Y has been rated the most American model made car on Cars.com Made in America index three years ago. [This end product] (ph) of the all the work\nwhich team has been doing all the years and to the extent that today, if you look at our vehicle lineup in US, we're about approximately on a weighted average\nbasis 85% USMCA compliant. So, like Elon said, this definitely gives us a bigger edge as compared to our other OEMs in terms of managing the tariffs, but we're\nnot immune because when the Section 232 auto tests become effective in May, which includes Canada and Mexico, and Canada and Mexico has been part of\nour regionalization study. They will have an impact on profitability. And I know research modeling on this impact has been up about a couple of thousand units\nwhich is pretty much in line with what we've been forecasting. The impact of tariffs on the energy business will be outsized since we source LFP battery cells from\nChina. We're in the process of commissioning equipment for the local manufacturing of LFP battery cells in the US. However, the equipment which we have can\nonly service a fraction of our total installed capacity of late. We've also been working on securing additional supply chain from non-China based suppliers, but it\nwill take time. Also note that, in spite of all the impact on US from energy -- from tariffs on the energy business, we do have a Megafactory China which just\nstarted operations in Q1, and that should take care of our business outside of the US. There's also an important impact of tariffs on our capital investments. I\nknow this is going to sound counterintuitive since in order to launch manufacturing or expand lines, we have to bring equipment from outside the US because\nthere is not that much capacity in the US. And the current trade environment, such equipment being brought in is subjective.", "char_count": 6852, "word_count": 1170, "token_count": 1404, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

Well, just to talk about the -- disambiguate Cybercab from robotaxi once again. So, the -- when will -- the Tesla's because the Tesla's that will be fully\nautonomous in June in Austin are probably Model Ys. So, that is currently on track to be able to do paid rides fully autonomously in Austin in June and then to be\nin many other cities in the US by the end of this year. It's very difficult to predict the exact ramp sort of week by week and month by month except that it will ramp\nup very quickly. So, it's going to be like some basically an S curve where it's very difficult to predict the intermediate slope of the S curve, but you kind of know\nwhere the S curve is going to end up, which is the vast majority of the Tesla fleet being autonomous. So, that's why I feel confident in predicting large scale\nautonomy around the middle of next year, but yeah. Certainly the second half of next year, meaning, I predict that there will be millions of Tesla's operating\nautonomously, fully autonomously in the second half of next year. Yeah. It does seem increasingly likely that there will be a localized parameter set, especially for\nplaces that have, say, very snowy weather, like, say, if you're in the northeast or something. Like this, you can think of it, it's kind of like a human. Like, if you, you\ncan be a very good driver in California, but are you going to be also a good driver in a blizzard in Manhattan? You're not going to be as good. So there is actually\nsome value in, you still drive, but you're probably, of an accident is higher. So it's increasingly obvious that there's some value to having a localized set of\nparameters for different regions and localities. But this is -- I\u2019ll put that in the nice-to-have category, not -- it's not the required category. Again, it's -- really the car\nis, it's just very much like the human.

That just shows that the AI-based solution that we\nhave is the right one because if you have gone down the previous rule-based solutions or like more hard-coded HD map-based solutions, it would have taken\nmany, many years to get China to work. You can see those in the videos that people post online themselves. So, the generalized solution that we are pursuing is\nthe right one that's going to scale well. And you can think of this location specific parameters that you don't need to ask a mixture of experts.

And so you can go many days without getting any single intervention. So you can't easily know whether you are improving or regressing in\nyour capacity. And we need to build out sophisticated simulations, including neural network based video generation.

In the past year, we've been like focusing on a lot of key development areas like, marrying these large subassemblies together\nin a precise way, in an accurate way. We've also derisked things like corrosion of uncoated aluminum structures, the ceiling across the seams of the vehicle and\nwhen you marry several components.

It's not a large volume production. This year, we'll make a few -- we do expect to make\nthousands of Optimus robots, but most of that production is going to be at the end of the year. So the -- almost everything in Optimus is new. There's not like an\nexisting supply chain for the motors, gearboxes, electronics, actuators, really anything in the Optimus apart from the AI for Tesla -- Tesla AI computer, which is\nthe same as the one in the car. So when you have a new complex manufactured product, it will move as fast as the slowest and least lucky component in the\nentire thing. And as opposed to proximation, there's like 10,000 unique things. So, that's why anyone who tells you they can predict with precision the production\nramp of the truly new product is -- doesn't know what they're talking about. It is totally impossible. So, you go through this like a series of constraints where I\nwould think this part is a limiting factor, now that part is a limiting factor, and this part is a limiting factor and multiply that by 1,000 basically. And then the rate of\nthe production is decided by how quickly you can solve each of those problems. Now, Optimus was affected by the magnet issue from China because the\nOptimus actuators in the arm do use permanent magnets. Now Tesla as a whole is not me to use permanent magnets. But when something is volume\nconstrained, like an arm of the robot, then you want to try to make the motors as small as possible. And then so we did the design in permanent magnets for\nthose motors, and those were affected by the supply chain, by basically China requiring an export license to send out anywhere with magnets. So, we\u2019re working\nthrough that with China. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a license to use the rare earth magnets. China wants some assurances that these are not used for military purposes,\nwhich, obviously, they\u2019re not. They\u2019re just going into a humanoid robot. So that\u2019s not a weapon system.

And for the iPhone, which resulted in the\nhigh end of the smartphone market quadrupling in size and actually Apple taking 60% market share. And so when you look at the Model 3 and the Model Y today,\nI think they are still actually vastly superior to any other cars. And I wonder why they've taken about 15% of their addressable market and not more actually? So,\nanother way to put it is, why are there so many people still buying BMWs and Mercedes, knowing that Model 3 and the Model Ys are out there and available? And\nI wonder if you're trying to solve that internally. If you understand why -- what are these auto buyers buying a Model 3 or Model Y missing?

But in the beginning of when the iPhone came out, I was like, wow, I can\u2019t believe these guys are not\nreacting as though this is death. But they didn\u2019t, they kept making the variants of smartphones. Nokia, I think, at one point was the most valuable company in the\nworld or close to it, but they kept making flip phones.

They just want a super intelligent phone that can do everything. Just one. So I said this many years ago.
