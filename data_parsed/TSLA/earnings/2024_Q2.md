## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Dan Levy (Barclays)**: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. First, wanted to start with a question on Shanghai. You've leveraged Shanghai as an export center really due
its low cost, and that makes sense. But maybe you can just give us a sense of, of how the strategy changes, if at all, given, the implementation of tariffs in
Europe. Also to what extent, your import of batteries from China into the U.S., how that might change given the tariffs. Thank you.

### Exchange 002

**Dan Levy (Barclays)**: Great. Thanks. Yes, thank you. As a follow-up, wanted to ask about the Robotaxi strategy and specifically the shareholder deck here notes that the release is
going to be -- one of the gating factors is regulatory approval. So maybe you could help us understand which regulations specifically are the ones that we should
be looking for? Is it FMVSS, that's standard? And then to what extent does the strategy shift? You've done with FSD more of a nationwide, no boundary
approach. Is the Robotaxi approach one that's more geofenced, so to speak, and is more driven by a state by state approach?

### Exchange 003

**Colin Langan (Wells Fargo)**: Oh, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Do you hear me?

### Exchange 004

**Colin Langan (Wells Fargo)**: Yes. Sorry. I guess when we are going to ask, if Trump wins, there's a higher chance that IRA could get cut. I think Elon, you had commented online that Tesla
doesn't survive on EV subsidies. But when Tesla lose a lot of support if IRA goes away? I think model Y3 and Y get IRA help for customers, and I think your
batteries get production tax credits. So, just one, can you clarify if the end, if IRA ends, would it be a negative for your profitability in the near-term? Why might it
not be a negative? And then, any framing of the current support you get, IRA-related?
