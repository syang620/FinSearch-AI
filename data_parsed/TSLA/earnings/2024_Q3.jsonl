So to recap, something that [Indiscernible] the industry I've seen year-over-year declines in order volumes in Q3. Tesla at the same time has achieved\nrecord deliveries. In fact, I think if you look at EV companies worldwide to the best of my knowledge, no EV company is even profitable. And I'm not - to the best\nof my knowledge, there was no EV division of any company, of any existing auto company that is profitable. So it is notable that Tesla is profitable despite a very\nchallenging automotive environment. And this quarter actually is a record Q3 for us. So we produced our 7-millionth vehicle actually just yesterday. So\ncongratulations to the teams that made it happen in Tesla. That's staggeringly immense amount of work to make 7million cars. So, let's see. And we also have\nthe energy storage business is growing like wildfire, with strong demand for both Megapack and Powerwall. And as people know, on October 10th, we laid out a\nvision for an autonomous future that I think is very compelling. So, the Tesla team did a phenomenal job there with actually giving people an opportunity to\nexperience the future, where you have humanoid robots walking among the crowd, not with a canned video presentation or anything, but literally walking among\nthe crowd, serving drinks and whatnot. And we had 50 autonomous vehicles. There were 20 Cybercabs, but there were an additional 30 Model Ys operating fully\nautonomously the entire night, carrying thousands of peoples [Indiscernible] with no incidents, the entire night. So -- and for those who went there that -- it's worth\nemphasizing that these the Cybercab had no steering wheel or brake or accelerator pedals. Meaning, there was no -- there's no -- there was no way for anyone to\nintervene manually even if they wanted to. And the whole night went very smoothly. So, regarding the vehicle business, we are still on-track to deliver more\naffordable models starting in the first half of 2025. This is I think probably people are wondering what should they assume for vehicle sales growth next year. And\nat the risk of - to take a bit of risk here, I do want to give some rough estimate, which is I think it's 20% to 30% vehicle growth next year. Notwithstanding negative\nexternal events, like if there's some force majeure events, like some big war breaks out or interest rates go sky high or something like that, then we can't\novercome massive force majeure events. But I think with our lower cost vehicles with the advent of autonomy something like a 20% to 30% growth next year is\nmy best guess. And then Cybercab reaching volume production in \u201926. I do feel confident of Cybercab reaching volume production in \u201826. So just starting\nproduction, reaching volume production in \u201826. And that's -- that should be substantial. And we're aiming for at least 2 million units a year of Cybercab. That'll be\nin more than one factory, but I think it's at least 2 million units a year, maybe 4 million ultimately. So, yeah, these are just my best guesses, but if you ask me my\nbest guesses, that those are my best guesses. The cell 4680 lines, the team is actually doing great work there. The 4680 is rapidly approaching the point where it\nis the most competitive set. So when you consider the fully landed - the cost of a battery pack, fully landed in the U.S. net of incentives and duties, the 4680 is\ntracking to be the most competitive. Meaning lower cost [Indiscernible] considered than any other alternative. We're not quite there yet, but we're close to being\nthere, which I think is, extremely exciting. And we've got several - a lot of ideas to go well beyond that. So if I think there's -- if we execute well, the 4680 will have\nthe -- Tesla internally produced cell will be the most cost competitive cell in North America, a testament to a tremendous amount of hard work there by the team.\nSo that's - we'll continue to buy a lot of cells from our competitors. Our intent is not to make to provide to make cells just internally. So I don't want to set off any\nalarm bells here. We're also increasing substantially our vehicle output and our stationary storage output. So we need a lot of cells. And most of them will still\ncome from suppliers, but I think it is some good news that the Tesla internal cell is likely - is tracking to be the most competitive in the U.S. So with respect to\nautonomy, as people are experiencing in the cars, really from week-to-week, there are significant improvements in the miles between interventions. So with the\nnew version 12.5, release of full self-driving in Cybertruck, combining the code into a single stack so that the, city driving and the entering the highway driving are\none stack, which is a bigger burden for the highway driving. So it's just all neural nets. And the release of Actually Smart Summon. We're trying to have a sense of\nhumor here. And we're also -- so that that's 12.5. Version 13 of FSD is going out soon. Ashok will elaborate more on that later in the call. We expect to see some\nroughly a 5 or 6 fold improvement in miles between interventions compared to 12.5. And looking at the year as a whole, the improvement in miles between\ninterventions, we think will be at least three orders of magnitude. So that's a very dramatic improvement in the course of the year. And we expect that trend to\ncontinue next year. So, the current internal expectation for the Tesla FSD having longer miles between intervention than human is the second quarter of next\nyear, which means it may end up being the third quarter, but it's next - it seems extremely likely to be next year. Ashok. Do you want to add anything?", "char_count": 5638, "word_count": 1001, "token_count": 1285, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

Sure. David, we showed some screenshots of this in the Q1 shareholder deck. And, yeah, this is real. We've been testing it for the better part of the year\nand, the building blocks that we needed in order to build this functionality and deliver it to production, we've been thinking about working on for years. It just so\nhappens that we've used those building blocks to deliver great features for our customers in the meantime, such as sharing your profile, synchronizing it across\ncars, so that every single car that you jump into, whether it's another car that you own or a car that somebody's loaned to you or a rental car that you jump into, it\nlooks exactly like yours. Everything's synchronized, seat mirror positions, media navigation, everything is the same. Just what you would expect from, one of our\nrobotaxis.

Seeing the progress on route\nin the mobile app, that's something you'll need for the ride-hailing app. But again, we released it in the meantime. So it's not like we're just starting to think about\nthis stuff right now while we're building out the early stages of our ride-hailing network.

And we do expect to roll out ride-hailing in California, Texas next year to the public. But not the California is somewhat there's quite a long regulatory\napproval process. I think we should get approval next year, but it's contingent upon regulatory approval. Texas is a lot faster. So it's, I'd say, like, we're -- we'll\ndefinitely have available at Texas, and probably have it available in California subject to regulatory approval. And then -- and maybe some other states actually,\nnext year as well, but at least California and Texas. So that'd be very exciting. There's really a profound change. Tesla becomes more than a sort of vehicle and\nbattery manufacturing company, at that point. So we published our Q3 vehicle safety report, which shows one impact for every 7 million miles of autopilot, that\ncompares to the U.S. average of one crash roughly every 700,000 miles. So it's currently showing a 10x safety improvement relative to the U.S. average. And we\ncontinue to expand our AI training capacity to accommodate the needs of both FSD and Optimus. We're currently not a training compute constraint. That's\nprobably the biggest factors that the FSD is actually getting so good that it takes us a while to actually find mistakes. And when you start getting to where it could\ntake 10,000 miles to find a mistake, it takes a while to actually figure out which it is -- is this soccer ball better than -- is soccer ball A better than soccer ball B? It\nactually takes a while to figure it out because neither one of them are making mistakes, or takes take a long time to make mistakes. So that's actually the single\n[Indiscernible] based on many factors. How long does it take us to figure out which version is better? So that\u2019s sort of high class problem. Obviously, having a\ngiant fleet is very helpful for breaking this out. And then with Optimus, we show a massive improvement in Optimus's dexterity movement on October 10. And our\nnext-gen, hand and forearm, which has 22 degrees of freedom double - which is double the prior hand and forearm, it's extremely human like. And also it's much\nbetter tactile sensing. It's really - I feel confident in saying that we have most advanced humanoid robot by long shot. And we're moreover the only company that\nreally has all of the ingredients necessary to scale humanoid robots. Because the things that what other companies are missing is that they're missing the AI\nbrain, and they're missing the ability to really scale to very high volume production. So some have seen some impressive video demos, but what but they\u2019re\n[lacking is] (ph) localized AI and the [going] (ph) to scale volume to very high numbers. As I've said on a few occasions before, I think Optimus will ultimately be\nthe most valuable product. So I think it has a good chance of being the most valuable product ever made. For the energy business, that's doing extremely well.\nAnd there's the opportunity ahead is gigantic. The Lathrop Megapack factory, reached 200 Megapacks a week, which is now a 40 gigawatt hour a year run rate.\nAnd, we have a second factory in Shanghai that will begin with a 20 gigawatt hour a year run rate in Q1 next year, so next quarter. And, that will also scale up. It\nwon't be long before, we're shipping a 100 gigawatt hours a year, stationary storage at Tesla. And that'll ultimately grow I think to multiple terawatt hours per year.\nIt has to actually in order to have a sustainable energy future. If you're not at the terawatt scale, you're not really moving the needle. So if you look at our\nadmittedly very complicated last master plan, which I think actually is too much detail.

And there are no fundamental material limitations. Like, there's not some very rare \nmaterial that we don't have enough of on earth. We actually have enough of raw materials to, yeah, take all of human civilization make it fully sustainable. And \neven if civilization dramatically increased its electricity usage, it would still be fully sustainable. One way to think of the progress of a civilization, it's based out a \nlittle esoteric, but is percentage completion of Kardashev scale. So Kardashev Scale 1 would be you're using all the power of a planet. We were we're currently\n\nless than 1% on Kardashev Level 1. Level 2 would be using all the power of the sun. And level 3, all the power of the galaxy. So we have a long way to go. Long\nway to go. When you think in Kardashev terms, it becomes obvious that by far the biggest source of energy is the sun. Everything else is in the noise. So in\nconclusion, Tesla is focused on building the future of energy, transport, robotics, and AI.

I mean, that is one trend which we observed in the industry that, because of affordability being impacted because of interest rates, People are willing to\ntake cars longer, especially in the U.S. And that is actually having an impact on all our industry too. As we discussed, earlier, as we discussed impact orders,\nenergy deployments fluctuate quarter over quarter due to customer readiness, location of orders being fulfilled, and not necessarily an indicator of demand or\nproduction within the quarter. While we did see a decline in Q3, we expect to grow our deployment sequentially in Q4 to end the year with more than doubled of\nlast year. Energy margins in Q3 were a record at more than 30%. This is a function of mix of projects being deployed in the quarter. Note that there will be\nfluctuation in margins as we manage through deployments and our inventory. Our pipeline and backlog continue to grow quarter over quarter as we fill our 2025\nproduction slots, and we're doing our little best to keep up with the demand. Just coming back on automotive margins, I talked about -- sorry. I talked about what\nis happening. One other thing which I want to also share is that we're -- that we will continue to keep whatever we can to squeeze like I said before about\nsqueezing out the cost. But this is something which we also are very capable of. I mean, just in Q3, we reached our lowest cost per micro. And that is a trend\nwhich we will keep focus on. Then going on to service and other, we continue to show improvements in Q3. This was a result of better performance, both in our\nservice business, which includes collision part sales and merchandise, and continued growth in supercharging. These field based revenues will continue to grow\nas the overall fleet size increases. Our operating expenses declined quarter over quarter in a year on year basis. This is partially due to the restructuring we\nundertook in Q2. Cost savings from these initiatives were partially offset by increase in costs related to our AI efforts. We've started using the GPU cluster based\nout of our factory house and ahead of schedule, and are on track to get 50k GPUs deployed in Texas by the end of this month. One thing which I'd like to\nelaborate is that we're being very judicious on our AI compute spend too and saying how best we can utilize the existing infrastructure before making further\ninvestments. On the CapEx front, we had about $3.5 billion in the quarter. This was a sequential increase largely because of investments in AI compute. We now\nexpect our CapEx for the year to be in excess of $11 billion. We shared our vision for the future at the real world event at the beginning of the month.

The first one is, is Tesla still on track to deliver the more affordable model next year as\nmentioned by Elon earlier?

And then I had a quick\nfollow-up really quick on your rollout in Texas and in California next year. The plan as you see today, is it to roll out, like, a fleet or two, with, cars that will start\nwith, like, a supervisory, like, some soup onboard supervision, someone, sitting at the wheel just in case and removing the supervisors progressively, or are you\naiming for going, free fledged without even a human super supervisor when you get started?", "char_count": 1056, "word_count": 189, "token_count": 245, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

Well, I guess we're going to I'll answer, yeah, the first part of the question. The nature of real world AI is, different from, say, an LLM in that, you have a\nmassive amount of context. So that, like, the you've got, case of Tesla 7 or 8 cameras, that, 9 up to 9 if you include the internal camera that that that so you got\ngigabytes of context, and that that is then distilled down into a small number of control outputs. Whereas it's like you don't really it's very rare to have in fact, I'm\nnot sure any LLM out there who can do gigabytes of context. And then you've got to then process that in the car with a very small amount of compute power. So,\nit's all doable and it's happening, but it is a different problem than what, say, a Gemini or OpenAI is doing. And now part of the way you can make up for the fact\nthat the inference computer is quite small is by spending a lot of effort on training. And just like a human, like, you the more you train on something, the less\nmental workload it takes when you try to -- when you do it, like when the first time like a driving it absolves your whole mind. But then as you train more and more\non driving different than the driving becomes a background task. It doesn't -- it only solves a small amount of your mental capacity because you have a lot of\ntraining. So we can make up for the fact that the insurance computers -- it's tiny compared to a 10-kilowatt bank of GPUs because you've got a few hundred watts\nof inference compute. We can make up that with heavy training. So yeah, that's -- and then there's also vast amounts to the actual petabytes of data coming in\ntremendous.
