My name is Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined\ntoday by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja and a number of other executives. Our Q2 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time, and the update deck\nwe published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are\nbased on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those\nmentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. [Operator Instructions] Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\nElon R. Musk\nThanks, Travis. So we've had a very exciting quarter. We were able to successfully launch robotaxi, so providing our first drives with no one in the driver seat with\npaying customers in Austin. And as some may have noted, we've already expanded our service area in Austin. It's bigger and longer. And it's going to get even\nbigger and longer. We were expecting to really greatly increase the Austin service area to well in excess of what competitors are doing. And that's hopefully in a\nweek or so, 2 weeks?", "char_count": 1283, "word_count": 217, "token_count": 289, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "TSLA_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q2_u_0000", "company": "TSLA", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2025, "period": "2025-Q2", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/TSLA/TSLA_FY2025_Q2.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

Musk\nA couple of weeks or so. And we're getting the regulatory permission to launch in the Bay Area, Nevada, Arizona, Florida, and a number of other places. So as \nwe get the approvals and we prove out safety, then we will be launching autonomous ride-hailing in most of the country. And I think we'll probably have \nautonomous ride-hailing in probably half the population of the U.S. by the end of the year. That's at least our goal, subject to regulatory approvals. I think we'll \ntechnically be able to do it. So assuming we get regulatory approvals, it's probably addressing half of the population in the U.S. by the end of the year. But we are \nbeing very cautious. We don't want to take any chances. And so we're going to go cautiously. But the service areas and the number of vehicles in operation will \nincrease at a hyper-exponential rate. So some other notable things. Model Y in June became the best-selling car in Turkey, Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria. \nIt is, I believe, the best-selling car of any kind in the world still. And autonomy is a big factor there. So even without -- even absent -- even without supervised -- \neven with just supervised self-driving, it's a huge selling point. And it's worth noting that we do not actually yet have approval for supervised FSD in Europe. So \nour sales in Europe, we think, will improve significantly once we are able to give customers the same experience that they have in the U.S. This is, I think, a very \nimportant point to convey. And we've been working with our main country regulator, which is the Netherlands. And I think we're close to getting approval with the \nNetherlands, then it's got to go to the EU. It's quite Kafka-esque. In fact, Kafka had no idea that something like the EU could exist beyond Kafka-esque challenges \nwith bureaucracy. But we will get the approvals. And I think we'll get -- some people in Europe will have an experience similar to that of the U.S. in most of Europe \nthis year, hopefully, at least partly in this quarter. And then we also have some regulatory challenges in China, which we're hoping to unblock shortly where we -- \nbecause we also cannot provide supervised FSD in China currently, but we hope to unblock that soon. That's also -- that's another major -- it really is the single \nbiggest demand driver. And then within the U.S., as we get confident about safety in different geographic areas, we'll loosen up on how much somebody has to \nbe laser-focused -- to have their eyes laser-focused on the road. That's been a common complaint. In fact, it does create an odd safety issue where people will \nsometimes disengage autopilot, then do something, change the radio or maybe look at the phone, drive with their knee and then reengage autopilot, which \nobviously is less safe than simply keeping autopilot on. So anyway, that experience will improve in the next several weeks. Because of our focus on Austin with \nno one in the driver seat, the production release of autopilot is actually several months behind what people experience on a robotaxi in Austin. So now we have \nthe robotaxi launched, we'll be adding back those elements so that there will be a step-change improvement in the autopilot experience for people outside of \nAustin. So this is really -- as you can tell, this is very much sort of autonomy is the story. Like we need the physical product, without which you cannot have \nautonomy. But once you have a physical product, you need -- the autonomy is what amplifies the value to stratospheric levels. We also launched the Tesla Diner, \nwhich has been a huge hit. It actually got worldwide attention, which is unusual for a diner. Diners don't typically get headline news around the earth. But this is a \npretty special diner. And if you're in the L.A. area, it's worth visiting. It's sort of a shining beacon of hope in an otherwise sort of bleak open landscape, frankly. So \nit's really quite a lovely experience. Great job by the Tesla team there. On the full self-driving front, I'll continue talking about that. We have -- we're continuing to \nmake significant improvements just with the software. So we're expecting to increase the parameter count. Actually, at this point, we think we can probably 10x \nthe -- almost 10x the parameter count. Yes, roughly 10x the parameter count. So this is actually a very tricky thing to do because, as you increase the parameter \ncount, you get choked on memory bandwidth. But we currently think we can 10x the parameter count from what people are currently experiencing. So not just 4x, \nactually 10x increase in parameter count. And yes, so still a lot of improvement on the existing hardware to happen. Energy is growing really well despite \nheadwinds from tariffs and supply chain challenges. The Megapack is expanding capacity quickly, and we have upgrades to the Megapack that will make it even \nbetter. And we had record powerwall deployment again in Q2. So I think batteries are just going to be a massive thing. The scale of batteries, battery demand, I \nthink, not that many people appreciate just how gigantic the scale of battery demand is. The way to think about it is that the U.S. sustained power output for the \nU.S. grid is around 1 terawatt but average usage is less than half a terawatt. If you add batteries to the mix, you can run the power plants 24/7 at full capacity, \nthus doubling -- more than doubling the energy output per year of the United States just with batteries. But that's again a big deal. It's a really big deal. Optimus, \nso we're evolving the Optimus design and really getting Optimus to the point where it is a phenomenal design. So we're in Optimus version 2 right now, sort of \n2.5. Optimus 3 is an exquisite design, in my opinion, and will be -- as I've said many times before, I predict it will be the biggest product ever. It's a very hard \nproblem to solve. You have to design every part of it from physics first principles. There's nothing that's off the shelf that actually works. So you got to design \nevery motor, gearbox, power electronics, control electronics, sensors, the mechanical elements. We also got to train Optimus to use its limb sensors with a neural \nnet. But we'll be applying the same techniques that we applied for our car, which is essentially a 4-wheel robot. And Optimus is a robot with arms and legs. So put \nthe same principles that apply to optimizing AI inference on the car, apply it to Optimus because they're both really robots in different forms. And Tesla, it is \nimportant to note that Tesla is by far the best in the world at real-world AI. Like a clear proof point for that would be -- if you compare, say, Tesla to Waymo, \nWaymo has got -- the car is festooned with God knows how many sensors. And yet, isn't Google good at AI? Yes, but they're not good at real-world AI. Thus far, \nthey have -- Tesla is actually much better than Google by far and much than anyone at real-world AI. And by far, Tesla has the best inference efficiency. Like I \nthink a key figure of merit for AI is what is the intelligence per gigabyte. And people talk about parameters, blah, blah, blah, but I think we'll -- stop talking about\n\nparameters and talk about per gigabytes because with the parameters, you can have 4-bit parameters, 8-bit parameters, 16-bit parameters. But the actual\nconstraints in the hardware are how many gigabytes of RAM and how many gigabytes per second can you transfer from RAM. Therefore, it is not a parameter\nconstraint. It is a byte constraint. And Tesla has the highest intelligence density of any AI by far. And I have a lot of insight into this with xAI. xAI is -- Grok is the\nsmartest AI overall, but it's -- Grok 4 is a giant beast sort of at the terabyte level. And so kind of important to note, Tesla has the best intelligence density.\nIntelligence density will be a very big deal in the future. It is now. So with Optimus 3, which is really the right design, it's like it doesn't have -- at this point, there's\nno significant flaws with the Optimus 3 design. But we are going to retool a bunch of things. So there will probably be prototypes of Optimus 3 end of this year and\nthen scale production next year. We're going to try to scale Optimus production as fast as it's humanly possible to do, so we'll try to get to 1 million units a year as\nquickly as possible. We think we can get there in less than 5 years, it's my sort of -- I guess. That's a reasonable aspiration, 1 million units a year, 5 years, it\nseems like an achievable target. So in conclusion, so far, 2025 has been a very exciting year, a lot of major milestones. We've made it clear with our\ndemonstrable progress in autonomy that a lot of naysayers said we would not achieve. But it's worth noting that we have done what we said we're going to do. It\ndoesn't mean we're always on time, but we get it done. Now the naysayers are sitting there with an egg on their face. So a great progress by the Tesla team. I do\nthink if Tesla continues to execute well with vehicle autonomy and humanoid robot autonomy, it will be the most valuable company in the world. There's a lot of\nexecution between here and there. It doesn't just happen. But provided we execute very well, I think Tesla has a shot at being the most valuable company in the\nworld. Obviously, I'm extremely optimistic about the future of the company. The best way to predict the future is to make it happen, and we're making it happen\nhere with the Tesla team. So I'd just like to say thanks to all of our supporters. And I think we've got an incredibly exciting future.", "char_count": 9610, "word_count": 1720, "token_count": 2199, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "TSLA_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q2_u_0001", "company": "TSLA", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2025, "period": "2025-Q2", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/TSLA/TSLA_FY2025_Q2.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

As Elon mentioned, Q2 was an interesting quarter in a few respects. We started ramping up the production of the new Model Y at all our factories.\nWe rolled out our robotaxi service in Austin and delivered a car completely autonomously directly from the factory to the customer's home. It is a seminal point to\nget to this thing. I mean it took a lot of effort, and I really want to thank everybody at Tesla to make this happen. It wasn't an easy thing to do, but we did it. It took\ntime, but we've just begun the next phase for the company. The One Big Bill has a lot of changes that would affect our business in the near term. The first among\nthose changes is the repeal of the IRA EV credit of $7,500 by the end of this quarter. Given the abrupt change, we have limited supply of vehicles in the U.S. this\nquarter as we have already with the lead times to order parts to build cars. We have rolled out all our planned incentives already and we'll start paring them back\nas we start to sell. If you are in the U.S. and looking to buy a car, place your order now as we may not be able to guarantee delivery orders placed in the later part\nof August and beyond. The bill also made changes to certain emission standards by reducing the amount of penalty to zero. This, in turn, will have an impact on\nthe new sales of regulatory credits to other OEMs and, in turn, will lead to lower revenue. While we now plan our business around such sales, it will nonetheless\nimpact our total revenues going forward. On the automotive product portfolio, the entire lineup is updated. Globally, we are seeing an increase in the number of\ntest drives. We started the production of the lower-cost model as planned in the first half of '25. However, given our focus on building and delivering as many\nvehicles as possible in the U.S. before the EV credit expires and the additional complexity of ramping a new product, the ramp will happen next quarter, slower\nthan initially expected. One thing which is grossly underappreciated, and Elon talked about it, is that all our vehicles in the lineup are capable of autonomy. This is\nby far the biggest differentiator between us and the competition. Our vehicles' top safety standard has this, but with FSD, they are and will continue to set a new\nstandard for safety within vehicular transportation. We published our vehicle safety report earlier today. And you can see a car on FSD is 10x safer than a car not\non FSD. We've started seeing an uptick in FSD adoption in North America in recent months, which is a very promising trend. And just to give you a perspective,\nsince the launch of -- since we moved to version 12 of FSD, we've seen the adoption rates really increase. We've started seeing the -- on the automotive revenue\nfront, despite reduction in regulatory credit revenue, the total automotive revenue increased by 19% sequentially, even though total deliveries only improved 14%.\nThis was primarily due to improved ASPs because of the new Model Y. This helped in improving margins sequentially as well, along with improved mix and higher\nfixed cost absorption despite an increase in cost from tariffs. We started seeing the impact of tariffs in our P&L. Sequentially, the cost of tariffs increased around\n$300 million with approximately 2/3 of that impact in automotive and rest in energy. However, given the latency in manufacturing and sales, the full impact will\ncome through in the following quarters, and so costs will increase in the near term. While we are doing our best to manage these impacts, we are in an\nunpredictable environment on the tariff front. The margins for the energy generation and storage businesses improved sequentially, while deployment reduced\nprimarily due to the ramp of power deployments at higher margins. We were able to achieve our highest gross profit for the business yet. Note that the overall\ndeployments will continue to vary quarter-to-quarter. I think Elon covered this that industrial storage will make a difference in this drive towards AI and data center\ngrowth. The energy requirements are increasing at a rapid scale as AI applications are very energy hungry. The quickest path to scale up energy is deploying\nstorage. This is something that our customers have started realizing. And despite this business having the largest impact from tariffs, we are seeing customers\nwilling to accept some of the tariff impacts. The Big Bill has certain adverse impacts even for the energy business, most notably on the residential storage\nbusiness due to the early expiration of consumer credits by the end of this year. The challenges on the storage business, therefore, remain both from the bill and\nfrom the tariffs, and we're doing our best to try and manage through this, but we will see shifts in demand and profitability. The margins for our service and other\nbusinesses improved sequentially, primarily due to higher profits from supercharging and improvement in insurance and service center profitability. Operating\nexpenses also grew sequentially as we continued our investment in AI projects, including additional expenses related to employee-related costs, including higher\nstock-based compensation and depreciation for AI compute. Our operating expenses, especially R&D-related spend, will continue to grow. We believe even in the\ncurrent environment, it is the right strategy to keep making investments in these areas to position us for the long term. Other income grew sequentially, primarily\nfrom the mark-to-market adjustment on Bitcoin holdings, which was a $284 million gain in Q2, while being $125 million loss in Q1. Just want to remind people that\nthis would keep creating volatility based on the Bitcoin price. While operating cash flows increased sequentially, so did our CapEx, resulting in $146 million of free\ncash flow. We continue to make investments in various aspects of manufacturing like Cybercab, Semi line and other manufacturing spend, and the expansion of\nour AI initiatives. Our latest expectation for the year in terms of CapEx is in excess of $9 billion. To summarize, we have near-term challenges in our business due\nto the negative impacts of the bill and tariffs. However, the investments that we have made for AI, robotics and our lead in energy sets us up for a bright future.

Thank you, guys. The next question is, what specific factory tasks is Optimus currently performing? And what is the expected time line for scaling\nproduction to enable external sales? How does Tesla envision Optimus contributing to revenue in the next 2 to 3 years?\nElon R. Musk\nYes. So the Optimus 3 design, as I mentioned earlier, is, I think, finding the right design. There will be further optimizations, but there are, I think, no fundamental\nchanges that are needed for the Optimus 3 design. It has all the degrees of freedom that you really want or need. So we'll have prototypes of that in, I don't know,\n3 months and then start production -- we'll certainly start production on that in the beginning of next year. The production ramp -- it's always difficult to predict the\nS curve of your production ramp when something has got an entire -- when everything is new because the rate of production will move as fast as the least lucky\nand least confident element of the entire supply chain as well as internal processes. So the more new stuff that is in a product, the slower the ramp could be\nbecause of unexpected supply chain interruptions or mistakes made internally. It's much easier to predict sort of the end of the S-curve or late in the S-curve than\nthe beginning of the S-curve. And the beginning of the S curve of the production ramp is, in any case, not really material for revenue purposes. The beginning of\nthe S-curve, you're usually -- usually, you're always negative gross margin, and you're debugging a lot of issues. So that's why it's -- I feel like fairly confident in\npredicting things or at least medium confident in predicting where we are in 5 years, but it's hard to predict where we are in a year or 2 years.

Well, the Cybercab, which is really optimized for autonomy, that, I think, has got probably sub-$0.30 per mile potential over time, maybe $0.25. It's really --\nlike if you design a car from scratch to be a cost-optimized robotic taxi like Cybercab -- like, for example, we're not trying to make its cornering like incredibly well\nlike a Model 3 would or Model S would or even a Model Y, like it's got -- all of our cars that are driven by people are super fun to drive. They've got incredible\nacceleration, incredible cornering capability. But we're confident that very few people in a Cybercab want to be hurtling around. So we've produced the top-end\nspeed, which means we can use more efficient tires. We don't need as much acceleration. We don't need as much -- take breaks to sort of -- we want stopping\ndistance, but we're not expecting it to be heavily used. It's a gentle ride. Essentially, if you design it for a gentle ride and then you have a much more optimized\ndesign point. So that's why it seems probable we could achieve that. Especially, Optimus is serving, cleaning up the car and doing maintenance and stuff. And\ndoing automatic charging. So I think it's going to -- the actual cost per mile of Cybercab will be very low. The cost per mile of our existing fleet will be higher, but\nstill very competitive. So maybe something over $0.50, I'm just guessing, yes.

Elon, you're not going to go crazy. We trust you. You can stay a little crazy. A little crazy is okay. Elon, now we understand the Board of Directors of a \nmajor U.S. investment bank recently toured Optimus production. I don't know if you want to confirm that or not. It's just what we've heard. That's cool. But when \ndo you think others will be able to get a firsthand view of Optimus like that? And is the second half of this year too soon to have an AI Day? Because it seems like \neverybody else in the world is doing it and this talent war is getting freaking crazy. And I know you mentioned, for recruiting purposes, this is a very important\n\nthing that you've done. I think people have copied you on this. And I'm wondering if this year is too early for that.\nElon R. Musk\nYes. It's a bit of a tough thing because like when we do an AI Day, we find that some of our competitors have literally done a frame- by-frame examination of our\nslides and everything we say and then copy us. So not to say like, well, where's the trade-off, which it does help with recruiting, but then competitors look very\nclosely and copy us. I mean that said, we should probably -- I mean, I guess we could consider the shareholder meeting to be sort of -- we can maybe go into\ndepth, some amount of depth at the Annual Shareholder Meeting with respect to Optimus and AI and sort of our chip stuff perhaps. Yes. Tesla is also really\nunderrated in terms of AI chip design as well as AI software. So like there's still not a chip that exists that we would prefer to put in our car, that is, an AI chip that\nwe would prefer to put in the car over our own, even though it's been now out for several years. And we're confident that the AI5 chip will be a profound game\nchanger. In fact, it's so powerful that we'll have to nerf it, to some degree, for markets outside of the U.S. because it flows way past the export restrictions. So\nunless the export restrictions change, we actually will have to nerf our AI5 chip, which is kind of weird. Hopefully, we keep raising the bar on export restrictions.\nOtherwise, it gets a bit [ soggy ]. We'll have a bunch of Optimus robots onstage at the shareholder meeting.

I don't know, some combination of like the\ntattooing junkyard and Westworld sort of thing. It's very cool. And Optimus is walking around the office here in Palo Alto.

I mean, fundamentally, the biggest obstacle remains that people just don't have -- some people don't -- the desire to buy the car is very high. Just people\ndon't have enough money in their bank account to buy it, literally, that is the issue, not a lack of desire, but a lack of ability. So the more affordable we can make\nthe car, the better. I think it's going to be -- it will be a very big deal when people can release their car to the fleet and have it earn money for them, which like I\nsaid, I think I feel confident in saying that will happen next year in the U.S. at least. In the U.S., we're legally allowed, appropriate disclaimers. And that will make\nthe affordability dramatically greater.

Trying another topic then. We see all these wonderful developments at xAI like Grok, and obviously, Tesla is trying to do quite a bit in AI.

Musk\nWell, they are doing different things here. So xAI is doing like terabyte-scale models and multi-terabyte-scale models. Tesla is 100x smaller models. So one is\nreal-world AI and one is kind of, I guess, artificial superintelligence type of thing. I mean, really kind of the genesis for xAI was that there were certain people who\nsimply would not join Tesla AI engineers because they wanted to work on ASI, and they would join Tesla. And I was like, \"Well, maybe they'll join a new\ncompany.\" I think the Tesla problem is extremely important, but not everyone agrees with me on that. And so rather than have them join OpenAI or Google or\nsome other company, it's like might as well have them create a company in that regard, which is xAI, so that's -- and particularly make a decision, do they want to\nwork on like superintelligence data center or real-world AI.
