So the Tesla team did an incredible job in 2023. We achieved record production and deliveries of over 1.8 million vehicles in line with our official\nguidance. And in Q4, we were producing vehicles at an annualized run rate of almost 2 million cars a year. This is really a phenomenal achievement. Looking at\njust the Fremont factory alone, we made 560,000 cars. This is a record. In fact, it's the highest output of automotive plants in North America. And people are often\nsurprised that the highest output factory, car factory in North America is in the San Francisco Bay area. It's a little counterintuitive, perhaps. And it's really had an\nincredibly positive impact on that entire area. What would have been a rundown strip mall is the highest productivity car plant in the Americas. Think about that. It\nwas derelict when we got it, and now it's the most productive plant in this entire part of the world. And it's enriched the community in so many different ways. It's\nreally a gem. So I'm super proud of the people that work there. Model Y became the best-selling vehicle globally, as predicted. The best-selling vehicle of any\nkind, not just electric vehicles with over 1.2 million units delivered. The energy storage business delivered nearly 15 gigawatt hours of batteries in 2023, compared\nto 6.5 gigawatt hours the year before. So tremendous year-over-year growth, triple-digits. And yeah, I think we'll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as\npredicted. I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that. Free cash flow remains strong at\n$4.4 billion in 2023, in spite of record spending on future projects. So we had record CapEx expenses as well as record R&D. This brings us to 2024. There's a lot\nto look forward to in 2024. Tesla is currently between two major growth waves. We're focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen\nvehicle, energy storage, full self-driving, other projects, is executed as well as possible. For full self-driving, we've released Version 12, which is a complete\narchitectural rewrite compared to prior versions. This is end-to-end artificial intelligence. So another bit nets basically photons in and controls out, and it really is\nquite a profound difference. This is currently just with employees and a few customers, but we will be rolling out to all customers in the U.S. who request full\nself-driving in the weeks to come. That's over 400,000 vehicles in North America. So this is the first-time AI is being used, not just for object perception, but for\npath planning and vehicle controls. We replaced 330,000 lines of C++ code with neural nets. It's really quite remarkable. Yeah, sort of, as a side note, I think\nTesla is probably the most efficient company in the world for AI inference. Out of necessity, we've actually had to be extremely good at getting the most out of\nhardware, because Hardware 3 at this point is several years old. So I think we're quite far ahead of any other company in the world in terms of AI and inference\nefficiency, which is going to be a very important metric in the future in many arenas. So, the new Model 3 is now available globally. So we did an updated Model\n3. While the car looks similar, a lot of work has gone into the vehicle to make it better in every way. It is significantly quieter, more refined, better equipped, has\nlonger range and many other improvements, and I recommend taking it for a test drive. If you have not driven a Model 3 in a long time, you should really try the\nnew one. So, steady improvements. And we're very far along on our next-generation low-cost vehicle. This is an earnings call, not a product announcement. So\nthere'll no doubt be many questions that try to ask us about new product, new products coming. But we reserve product announcements for product\nannouncements not earning calls. So -- but we're very excited about this, and this is really going to be profound, not just in its design of the vehicle itself, but in\nthe design of the manufacturing system. This is a revolutionary manufacturing system significantly, far more advanced than any other automotive manufacturing\nsystem in the world, by a significant margin. Several years ago, I said, perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be\nmanufacturing technology and you will really see that come to bear with our next-gen vehicle. The first manufacturing location for this will be at our Gigafactory\nand headquarters in Austin, Texas, and then we'll follow that up with other locations around the world. Probably the factory we'll build in Mexico will be second,\nand then we'll be looking to identify a third location, perhaps by the end of this year or early next outside of North America. In conclusion, we had a great year with\nrecord production, record deliveries, and a strong free cash flow in spite of a very high interest rate environment. And we are focused on exciting new projects\nthat will -- I think, ultimately if we execute on all these things, and it is very hard to do all these things, it's not a sure thing. But I do see a path where Tesla could\none day be the most valuable company in the world. I do emphasize that is not an easy path and a very difficult one, but it is now in the set of possible outcomes\nand previously I would not have thought it is in the set of possible outcomes. And thank you, again to all of our investors, our employees, and our suppliers for a\nstrong year, and looking forward to a great 2024 and years to come.

Good afternoon, everyone. As Elon mentioned, we had a record year in terms of both production and deliveries for our auto business as well as \nrecord deployments in our energy business. This was achieved despite 2023 being a challenging year in terms of higher interest rates and higher inflation. Big \nthanks to our customer for being with us through this challenging period. I would also like to thank the whole Tesla team for their resolve and dedication \nthroughout. In terms of 2023 financials, we ended the year with over $96 billion of revenue and generated $4.4 billion of free cash flow to end the year with over \n$29 billion of cash and investments on hand. Our 2023 GAAP net income was impacted by the recognition of one-time non-cash benefit of $5.9 billion from the \nrelease of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. This was due to our recent history of sustained profitability and is similar to several other companies \nwho have recently gone through a similar change in their account. Accordingly, starting with Q1, our book tax rate will now be more in line with other companies in \nthe S&P 500. In our vehicle business, we continue to see improvements in our per unit cost despite us being in the early phase of Cybertruck ramp. As a result, \nour auto gross margin improved sequentially. That said, predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this \nequation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few. While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are \napproaching the limits within our current platforms. On the demand front, as promised, we made investments in digital campaigns in 2023. We fully appreciate the \nimportance of customer education as we are still in a customer acquisition phase. Our data suggests that around 90% of our vehicle buyers in 2023 never owned\n\na Tesla before. We are being creative in figuring out ways to bring in new customers and educate them about the benefits of owning a Tesla versus gas-powered\nvehicles. The key among them being total cost of ownership. This concept is mostly overlooked for just the upfront cost. We will be rigorous in evaluating our\ncampaigns, curating the content, and optimizing spend accordingly to support the overall demand. There are two additional things I would like to mention as it\nrelates to the US market. First, for customers who qualify for the IRA buyer credit, we now offer that as a point-of-sale benefit for Model Y, which means an\nimmediate reduction of $7,500 at the time of purchase to the end customer. Secondly, we continue to offer very attractive lease rates for Model 3 and Y using our\nPartner Leasing Program. Note that the sales under this program are recognized as upfront revenue and reported within automotive sales. Our energy storage\nbusiness had another record year with deployments more than doubling and revenues increasing by more than 50%. This business is poised to again surpass our\nauto business in terms of growth rate in 2024. This has been in the works for quite some time with us laying the foundation a few years back by building our\nMegafactory in Lathrop. I would like to thank the whole Tesla Energy team for their efforts to make this a reality. Our services and others business also started\ncontributing meaningfully to our results and our fleets -- as our fleet grows. As we expected the fleet-based revenues from supercharging, used cars, and services\ncontinue to increase. For 2024, our focus is to continue growing our output, continuing our cost reduction efforts, and increasing investments in our future growth\ninitiatives. Accordingly, we are currently expecting our capital expenditure for 2024 to be in excess of $10 billion. We believe this would be critical in helping us lay\nthe foundation for the next phase of growth. Once again, I would like to thank everybody at Tesla, our investors, and our suppliers for being with us in this journey.\nWe can open it up to questions, Martin.\nA - Martin Viecha\nThank you. Let's go through investor questions. Question number one is from Michael. Given that you moved the start of the next-generation compact vehicle\nproduction to Austin, has the timeline improved so that we might see next-generation platform vehicles in 2025?", "char_count": 4344, "word_count": 733, "token_count": 898, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

I don't want to blow your minds, but I'm often\noptimistic regarding time. But our current schedule shows that we will start production towards the end of 2025. So sometime in the second half. That's just what\nour current schedule says. But there's a lot of new technology like a tremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology here. The reason I\nwanted to put this new revolutionary manufacturing line at Giga Texas was because we really need the engineers to be living on the line. This is not sort of off the\nshelf, just works type of thing. And it's just a lot easier for Tesla engineering to live online if it's in Austin versus elsewhere. So -- but we are currently expecting to\nstart production second half next year. That will be a challenging production ramp. Like, as I can emphasize we'll be sleeping on the line practically. In fact, not\npractically. We will be. But I am confident that once it is going, it will be head and shoulders above any other manufacturing technology that exists anywhere in the\nworld. It's next level. So it's always difficult to predict what that S-curve of manufacturing looks like. So it always starts off real slow, and then it grows\nexponentially. So -- and predicting that intermediate S-curve is difficult, so I don't know. It's hard to say what the unit volume would be next year. We're not going\nto make any predictions on that front, but it does seem quite likely that we will start production next year.", "char_count": 1581, "word_count": 280, "token_count": 344, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

So we're obviously hedging our bets here with significant orders of Nvidia GPUs. Or GPU is the wrong\nword. There really needs to be -- there's no -- it doesn't -- you can't produce graphics, so that's what. It's not a graphics processing unit. Neural net processing\nunit or something like that. Yeah. GPU is a funny word, like Vestigial. A lot of our progress in self-driving is training limited, something that's important with\ntraining, it's much like a human. The more effort you put into training, the less effort you need in inference. So just like a person, if you train in a subject, sort of\nclassic 10,000 hours, the less mental effort it takes to do something. If you remember when you first started to drive, how much of your mental capacity it took to\ndrive. It was -- you had to be focused completely on driving. Then after you've been driving for many years, it only takes a little bit of your mind to drive and you\ncan think about other things and still drive safely. So the more training you do, the more efficient it is at the inference level. So we do need a lot of training. And\nwe're pursuing the dual path of Nvidia and Dojo. But I would think of Dojo as a long shot. It's a long shot worth taking because the payoff is potentially very high.\nBut it's not something that is a high probability. It's not like a sure thing at all. It's a high-risk, high-payoff program. Dojo is working, and it is doing training jobs,\nand we are scaling it up, and we have plans for Dojo 1.5, Dojo 2, Dojo 3, and whatnot. So I think it's got potential, but I can't emphasize enough. High risk, high\npayoff. So I think it still makes sense given the -- even if it's a low probability of success -- I'm laboring the subject. It's a very interesting program. It has the\npotential for something special. There's also our inference hardware in the car. So we're now on what's called Hardware 4, but it's actually Version 2 of the\nTesla-designed AI inference chip. And we're about to complete design of -- the terminology is a bit confusing. We're about to complete design of Hardware 5,\nwhich is actually Version 3 of the Tesla-designed chip. Because the Version 1 was Mobileye, Version 2 was Nvidia, and then Version 3 was Tesla. And we're\nmaking gigantic improvements from Hardware 3 to Hardware 4 to Hardware 5. I mean, there's a potentially interesting play where when cars are not in use in the\nfuture that the in-car computer can do generalized AI tasks, can run a sort of GPT-4 or GPT-3 or something like that. If you've got tens of millions of vehicles out\nthere, even in a robotaxi scenario where they're in heavy use, maybe they're used 50 out of 168 hours, that still leaves well over 100 hours of time available -- of\ncompute hours.
