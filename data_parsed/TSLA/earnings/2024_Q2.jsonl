So to recap, we saw large adoption exploration in EVs, and then a bit of a hangover as others struggle to make compelling EVs. So there are quite a\nfew competing electric vehicles that have entered the market. And mostly they\u2019ve not done well, but they\u2019ve discounted their EVs very substantially, which has\nmade it a bit more difficult for Tesla. We don\u2019t see this as long-term issue, but really -- fairly short-term. And we still obviously firmly believe that EVs are best for\ncustomers and that the world is headed for a fully electrified transport, not just the cars, but also aircrafts and boats. Despite many challenges the Tesla team did\na great job executing and we did achieve record quarterly revenues. Energy storage deployments reached an all-time high in Q2, leading to record profits for the\nenergy business. And we are investing in many future projects, including AI training and inference and great deal of infrastructure to support future products. We\nwon't get too much into the product roadmap here, because that is reserved for product announcement events. But we are on track to deliver a more affordable\nmodel in the first half of next year. The big -- really by far the biggest differentiator for Tesla is autonomy. In addition to that, we've scale economies and we're the\nmost efficient electric vehicle producer in the world. So, this, anyway -- while others are pursuing different parts of the AI robotic stack, we are pursuing all of\nthem. This allows for better cost control, more scale, quicker time to market, and a superior product, applying not to -- not just to autonomous vehicles, but to\nautonomous humanoid robots like Optimus. Regarding Full Self-Driving and Robotaxi, we've made a lot of progress with Full Self-Driving in Q2 and with version\n12.5 beginning rollout, we think customers will experience a step change improvement in how well supervised full self-driving works. Version 12.5 has 5x the\nparameters of 12.4 and will finally merge the highway and city stacks. So the highway stack is still at this point is pretty old. So often the issues people encounter\nare on highway, but with 12.5, we are finally merged the two stacks. I still find that most people actually don't know how good the system is, and I would\nencourage anyone to understand the system better, to simply try it out and let the car drive you around. One of the things we're going to be doing just to make\nsure people actually understand the capabilities of the car is when delivering a new car and when picking up a car for service to just show people how to use it\nand just drive them around the block. Once people use it at all they tend to continue using it. So it's very compelling. And then this I think will be a massive\ndemand driver, even unsupervised full self-driving will be a massive demand driver. And as we increase the miles between intervention, it will transition from\nsupervised full self-driving to unsupervised full self-driving, and we can unlock massive potential in [V3] (ph). We postponed the sort of Robotaxi the sort of\nproduct unveil by a couple of months where it were -- it shifted to 10/10 to the 10th October -end because I wanted to make some important changes that I think\nwould improve the vehicle -- sort of Robotaxi, the thing that we are -- the main thing that we are going to show and we are also going to show off a couple of other\nthings. So moving it back a few months allowed us to improve the Robotaxi as well as add in a couple other things for the product unveil. We're also nearing\ncompletion of the South expansion of Giga Texas, which will house our largest training cluster to date. So it will be an incremental for 50,000 H100s plus 20,000\nof our hardware 4 AI5 Tesla AI computer. With Optimus, Optimus is already performing tasks in our factory. And we expect to have Optimus production Version 1\nin limited production starting early next year. This will be for Tesla consumption. It's just better for us to iron out the issues ourselves. But we expect to have\nseveral thousand Optimus robots produced and doing useful things by the end of next year in the Tesla factories. And then in 2026, ramping up production quite a\nbit, and at that point we'll be providing Optimus robots to outside customers. That will be Production Version 2 of Optimus. For the energy business, this is\ngrowing faster than anything else. This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained. So we are ramping up production in our U.S.\nfactory as well as building the Megapack factory in China that should roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially. So in\nconclusion, we are super excited about the progress across the board. We are changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the\neconomy. The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright. I really just can't emphasize just the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side\nand for Optimus. Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised FSD essentially enabling the fleet to operate like a\ngiant autonomous fleet. And it takes the valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number. ARK Invest thinks, on the order of $5 trillion, I think they are probably not\nwrong. And long-term Optimus, I think, it achieves a valuation several times that number. I want to thank the Tesla team for a strong execution and looking\nforward to exciting years ahead.", "char_count": 5500, "word_count": 956, "token_count": 1197, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "TSLA_TRANSCRIPT_2024_Q2_u_0001", "company": "TSLA", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2024, "period": "2024-Q2", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/TSLA/TSLA_FY2024_Q2.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

As Elon mentioned, the Tesla team rose to the occasion yet again and delivered on all fronts with some notable records. In addition to those records, we \nsaw our automotive deliveries go sequentially. I would like to thank the entire Tesla team for their efforts in delivering a great quarter. On the auto business front, \naffordability remains a top of mind for customers, and in response in Q2, we offered attractive financing options to offset sustained high interest rates. These \nprograms had an impact on revenue per unit in the quarter. These impacts will persist into Q3 as we have already launched similar programs. We are now \noffering extremely competitive financing rates in most parts of the world. This is the best time to buy a Tesla, I mean, if you are waiting on the sidelines, come out \nand get your car. We had a record quarter on regulatory credits, revenues, and as well. On net, our auto margins remained flat sequentially. It is important to note \nthat the demand for regulatory credits is dependent on other OEMs plans for the kind of vehicles they are manufacturing and selling as well as changes in \nregulations. We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further localize our supply chain, not just \nin the U.S., but in Europe and China as well for the respective factories. As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price. \nWe have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than 300 miles on a single charge. We believe this, along with the \nexpansion of our supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range anxiety. Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we've seen production \nrates increase meaningfully and expect this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further. Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we\n\nremoved the impact of Cybertruck. While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such reductions would\nshow up in the P&L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered. Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that\nwe are still ramping Cybertruck and Model 3 and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished goods. While our\nteams are working feverishly to offset these, unfortunately it may have an impact on the cost in the near-term. We previously talked about the potential of the\nenergy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was laid over time is bearing the expected results. Energy storage deployments more than doubled\nwith contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting in record revenues and profit for the energy business. Energy storage backlog is strong.\nAs discussed before, deployments will fluctuate from period to period with some quarters seeing large increases and others seeing a decline. Recognition of\nstorage gigawatt hours is dependent on a variety of factors, including logistics timing as we send units from a single factory to markets across the world, customer\nreadiness and in case of EPC projects on construction activities. Moving on to the other parts of the business, service and other gross profits also improved\nsequentially from the improvement in service utilization and growth in our collision repair business. The impact of our recent reorg is reflected in restructuring\nother - on the income statement. Just to level set, this was about $622 million of charge, which got recorded in the period. And I want people to remember that\nwe've called it out separately on the financials. Sequentially, our operating expenses excluding surcharges reduced despite an increase in spend for AI-related\nactivities and higher legal and other costs. On the CapEx front, while we saw a sequential decline in Q2, we still expect the year to be over $10 billion in CapEx as\nwe increase our spend to bring a 50k GPU cluster online. This new cluster will immensely increase our capabilities to scale FSD and other AI initiatives. We\nreverted to positive free cash flow of $1.3 billion in Q2. This was despite restructuring payments being made in the quarter and we ended the quarter with over\n$30 billion of cash and investments. Once again, we've begun the journey towards the next phase for the company with the building blocks being placed. It will\ntake some time, but will be a rewarding experience for everyone involved. Once again, I would like to thank the entire Tesla team for their efforts.\nA - Travis Axelrod\nGreat. Thank you very much, Vaibhav. Now let's go to investor questions.

There's a huge difference in the -- from peak to trough in\nterms of energy of power generation.
