So to recap in Q1 we navigated several unforeseen challenges as well as the ramp of the updated Model 3 in Fremont. There was, as we all have\nseen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead. We\nbelieve this is not the right strategy and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market. Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in\na tough environment and energy storage deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the energy\nbusiness, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead. It will increase. We actually know that it will, so significantly faster than the\ncar business as we expected. We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially. In terms of the\nnew product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next \u2013 in the past several weeks. We've updated our future vehicle\nlineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup production in the second half of 2025, so we expect it to be more like the early\n2025, if not late this year. These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current\nplatforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup. So it's not contingent on any new factory or massive new\nproduction line. It'll be made on our current production lines much more efficiently. And we think this should allow us to get to over 3 million vehicles of capacity\nwhen realized to the full extent. Regarding FSD Version 12, which is the pure AI-based self-driving, if you haven't experienced this, I strongly urge you to try it out.\nIt's profound and the rate of improvement is rapid so \u2013 and we've now turned that on for all cars with the cameras and inference computer and everything from\nHardware 3 on in North America. And so it's been pushed out to, I think, around 1.8 million vehicles and we're seeing about half of people use it so far and that\npercentage is increasing with each passing week. So we now have over 300 billion miles that have been driven with FSD V12. Since the launch of full self-driving,\nsupervised full self-driving, it's become very clear that the vision-based approach with end to end neural networks is the right solution for scalable autonomy. It's\nreally how humans drive. Our entire road network is designed for biological neural nets and eyes. So naturally cameras and digital neural nets are the solution to\nour current road system. To make it more accessible, we've reduced the subscription price to $99 a month, so it's easy to try out. And as we've announced, we'll\nbe showcasing our purpose-built robotaxi, or Cybercab, in August. Yes. Regarding AI compute, over the past few months, we've been actively working on\nexpanding Tesla's core AI infrastructure. For a while there, we were training constrained in our progress. We are, at this point, no longer training constrained and\nso we're making rapid progress. We've installed and commissioned, meaning they're actually working 35,000 H100 computers or GPUs, GPU is wrong word, they\nneed a new word. I always feel like a wince when I say GPU because it's not \u2013 GPU stands \u2013 G stands for graphics, and it doesn't do graphics. But anyway\nroughly 35,000 H100s are active, and we expect that to be probably 85,000 or thereabouts by the end of this year and training, just for training. We are making\nsure that we're being as efficient as possible in our training. It's not just about the number of H100s, but how efficiently they're used. So in conclusion, we're super\nexcited about our autonomy road map. I think it should be obvious to anyone who's driving Version 12 and it tells that that it is only a matter of time before we\nexceed the reliability of humans and not much time with that. And we're really headed for an electric vehicle, an autonomous future. And I'll go back to something\nI said several years ago that in the future, gasoline cars that are not autonomous will be like riding a horse and using a flip phone. And that will become very\nobvious in hindsight. We continue to make the necessary investments that will drive growth and profits for Tesla in the future, and I wanted to thank the Tesla\nteam for incredible execution during this period and look forward to everything that we have planned ahead.

It's important to acknowledge what Elon said, from our auto business perspective. We did see a seasonal decline in revenues quarter-over-quarter and \nthose were primarily because of seasonality, uncertain macroeconomic environment and the other reasons, which Elon had mentioned earlier. Auto margins \ndeclined from 18.9% to 18.5%. Excluding the impact of Cybertruck, the impact of pricing actions was largely offset by reductions in per unit costs and the \nrecognition of revenue from Autopark feature for certain vehicles in the U.S. that previously did not have that functionality. Additionally, while we did experience \nhigher cost due to the ramp of Model 3 in Fremont and disruptions in Berlin, these costs were largely offset by cost reduction initiatives. In fact, if we exclude \nCybertruck and Fremont Model 3 ramp costs, the revenue from Autopark, auto margins improved slightly. Currently normalized Model Y cost per vehicle in Austin \nand Berlin are already very close to that of Fremont. Our ability to reduce costs without sacrificing on quality was due to the amazing efforts of the team, in \nexecuting Tesla's relentless pursuit of efficiency across the business. We've also witnessed that as other OEMs are pulling back on their investments in EV, there \nis increasing appetite for credits, and that means a steady stream of revenue for us. Obviously, seeing others pull back from EV is not the future we want. We \nwould prefer it the whole industry went all in. On the demand front, we've undertaken a variety of initiatives, including lowering the price of both the purchase and \nsubscription options for FSD launching extremely attractive leasing specials for the Model 3 in the U.S. for $299 a month and offering attractive financing options \nin certain markets. We believe that our awareness activities, paired with attractive financing, will go a long way in expanding our reach and driving demand for our \nproducts. Our Energy business continues to make meaningful progress with margins reaching a record of 24.6%. We expect the energy storage deployments for \n2024 to grow at least 75% higher from 2023. And accordingly, this business will begin contributing significantly to our overall profitability. Note that there is a bit of \nlumpiness in our storage deployments due to a variety of factors that are outside of our control, so deployments may fluctuate quarter-over-quarter. On the \noperating expense front, we saw a sequential increase from our AI initiatives, continued investment in future projects, marketing and other activities. We had \nnegative free cash flow of $2.5 billion in the first quarter. The primary driver of this was an increase in inventory from a mismatch between builds and deliveries as \ndiscussed before, and our elevated spend on CapEx across various initiatives, including AI compute. We expect the inventory build to reverse in the second\n\nquarter and free cash flow to return to positive again. As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, we had to make the hard but necessary decision\nto reduce our head count by over 10%. The savings generated are expected to be well in excess of $1 billion on an annual run rate basis. We are also getting\nhyper focused on CapEx efficiency and utilizing our installed capacity in a more efficient manner. The savings from these initiatives, including our cost reductions\nwill help improve our overall profitability and ultimately enable us to increase the scale of our investments in AI. In conclusion, the future is extremely bright and\nthe journey to get there while challenging will be extremely rewarding. Once again, I would like to thank the whole Tesla team for delivering great results. And we\ncan open it up to Q&A.\nA - Martin Viecha\nOkay. Let's start with investor Q&A.

Because if you've got a sentient humanoid robots that is able\nto navigate reality and do tasks at request, there is no meaningful limit to the size of the economy. So that's what is going to happen.

Just like an elevator, it takes you to your floor. That's it. Don't think about how the elevator is working or anything like that. And \nsomething I should clarify is that Tesla will be operating the fleet. So you can think of like how Tesla, think of it\u2019s like some combination of Airbnb and Uber, \nmeaning that there will be some number of cars that Tesla owns itself and operates in the fleet. There will be some number of cars and then there'll be a bunch of \ncars where they're owned by the end user. That end user can add or subtract their car to the fleet whenever they want, and they can decide if they want to only let \nthe car be used by friends and family or only by 5-star users or by anyone at any time they could have the car come back to them and be exclusively theirs, like\n\nan Airbnb. You could rent out your guest room or not, any time you want. So as our fleet grows, we have 7 million cars going to \u2013 9 million cars going to,\neventually tens of millions of cars worldwide. With a constant feedback loop, every time something goes wrong, that gets added to the training data and you get\nthis training flywheel happening in the same way that Google Search has the sort of flywheel, it's very difficult to compete with Google because people are\nconstantly doing searches and clicking and Google is getting that feedback loop. It\u2019s the same with Tesla. But at a scale that is maybe difficult to comprehend, but\nultimately, it will be tens of millions. I think there's also some potential here for an AWS element down the road where if we've got very powerful inference\nbecause we've got a Hardware 3 in the cars, but now all cars are being made with Hardware 4. Hardware 5 is pretty much designed and should be in cars,\nhopefully towards the end of next year. And there's a potential to run \u2013 when the car is not moving to actually run distributed inference. So kind of like AWS, but\ndistributed inference. Like it takes a lot of computers to train an AI model, but many orders of magnitude less compute to run it. So if you can imagine future,\nperhaps where there's a fleet of 100 million Teslas, and on average, they've got like maybe a kilowatt of inference compute. That's 100 gigawatts of inference\ncompute distributed all around the world. It's pretty hard to put together 100 gigawatts of AI compute. And even in an autonomous future where the car is,\nperhaps, used instead of being used 10 hours a week, it is used 50 hours a week. That still leaves over 100 hours a week where the car inference computer could\nbe doing something else.

And only after all of this is validated, then we go to external customers. And even when we go external, we have like live\ndashboards of monitoring every critical event that's happening in the fleet sorted by the criticality of it. So we are having a constant pulse on the build quality and\nthe safety improvement along the way. And then any failures like Elon alluded to, we get the data back, add it to the training and that improves the model in the\nnext cycle. So we have this like constant feedback loop of issues, fixes, evaluations and then rinse and repeat. And especially with the new V12 architecture, all\nof this is automatically improving without requiring much engineering interventions in the sense that engineers don't have to be creative in like how they code the\nalgorithms. It's mostly learning on its own based on data. So you see that, okay, every failure or like this is how a person shows, this is how you drive this\nintersection or something like that, they get the data back. We add it to the neural network, and it learns from that trained data automatically instead of some\nengineers saying that, oh, here, you must rotate the steering wheel by this much or something like that. There's no hard inference conditions, it's everything is\nneural network, it's very soft, it's probabilistic.
