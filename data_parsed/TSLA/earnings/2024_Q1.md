## Prepared Remarks

### Martin Viecha (Unknown)

Tesla's First Quarter 2024 Q&A Webcast. My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and a number
of other executives. Our Q1 results were announced at about 3.00 p.m. Central Time in the Update Deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During
this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.
Actual events and results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.
During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the
question queue. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?

## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Tony Sacconaghi (Bernstein)**: Thank you for taking the question. I was just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on kind of the new vehicles that you talked about today. Are these like
tweaks on existing models, given that they’re going to be running on the same lines? Are these like new models? And how should we think about them in the
context of like the Model 3 Highland update, what will these models be like relative to that? And given the quick time frame, Model 3 Highland has required a lot of
work and a lot of retooling. Maybe you can help put that all in context. Thank you, and I have a follow-up, please.

### Exchange 002

**Tony Sacconaghi (Bernstein)**: It’s a more personal one for you, Elon, which is that you’re leading many important companies right now. Maybe you can just talk about where your heart is at in
terms of your interests and do you expect to lessen your involvement with Tesla at any point over the next three years?

### Exchange 003

**Adam Jonas (Morgan Stanley)**: Okay. Great. Hey, Elon. So you and your team on volume expect a 2024 growth rate, notably lower than that achieved in 2023. But what's your team's degree of
confidence on growth above 0%? Or in other words, does that statement leave room for potentially lower sales year-on-year?

### Exchange 004

**Adam Jonas (Morgan Stanley)**: Okay. My follow-up, Elon, on future product. If you had nailed execution, assuming that you nail execution on your next-gen cheaper vehicles, more aggressive
giga castings, I don't want to say one piece, but getting closer to one piece, structural pack, unboxed, 300-mile range, $25,000 price point, putting aside robotaxi,
those features unique to you. How long would it take your best Chinese competitors to copy a cheaper and better vehicle that you could offer a couple of years
from now? How long would it take your best Chinese competitors to copy that? Thanks.

### Exchange 005

**Alex Potter (Piper Sandler)**: Great, thanks. Yes, so I couldn't agree more. The thesis hinges completely on AI, the future of AI, full self-driving neural net training, all of these things. In that
context, Elon, you've spoken about your desire to obtain 25% voting control of the company. And I understand completely why that would be. So I'm not
necessarily asking about that. I'm asking if you've come up with any mechanism by which you can ensure that you'll obtain that level of voting control. Because if
not, then the core part of the thesis could potentially be at risk. So any additional commentary you might have on that topic.

### Exchange 006

**Alex Potter (Piper Sandler)**: All right. That's actually all very helpful context. Thank you. Maybe one final question and I'll pass it on. OpEx reductions, thank you for quantifying the impact
there. I'd be interested also in potentially more qualitative discussion of what the implications are for these headcount reductions. What are the types of activities
that you're presumably sacrificing as a result of parting ways with these folks? Thanks very much.

### Exchange 007

**Alex Potter (Piper Sandler)**: But you shed the tail.

### Exchange 008

**Mark Delaney (Goldman Sachs)**: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the question. The company previously characterized potential FSD licensing discussions in the early phase
and some OEMs had not really been believing in it. Can you elaborate on how much the licensing business opportunity you mentioned today has progressed?
And is there anything Tesla needs to achieve with the technology in terms of product milestones in order to be successful at reaching a licensing agreement in
your view?

### Exchange 009

**Mark Delaney (Goldman Sachs)**: It becomes a method of survival?

### Exchange 010

**Mark Delaney (Goldman Sachs)**: Yes, very helpful. Thank you. My follow-up was to better understand Tesla's approach to pricing going forward. Previously, the company had said that the price
reductions were driving incremental demand with how affordable the cars have become, especially for vehicles that have access to IRA credits and some of the
leasing offers that Tesla has in place. Do you still see meaningful incremental price reductions as making sense from here for the existing products? And can the
company meaningfully lower prices from here and also stay free cash flow positive on an annual basis with the current product set? Thanks.

### Exchange 011

**Colin Rusch (Oppenheimer)**: Thanks so much, guys. Given the pursuit of Tesla really as a leader in AI for the physical world, in your comments around distributed inference, can you talk
about what that approach is unlocking beyond what’s happening in the vehicle right now?

### Exchange 012

**Colin Rusch (Oppenheimer)**: Thanks so much guys. And just my follow-up is a little bit more mundane. Looking at the 4680 ramp, can you talk about how close you were to target yields and
when you might start to accelerate incremental capacity expansions on that technology?
