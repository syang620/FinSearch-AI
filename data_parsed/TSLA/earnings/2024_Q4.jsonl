So, in summary, in Q4, we set a record and delivered vehicles at an annualized rate of nearly 2 million a year. So, congratulations to the Tesla team \non excellent work, achieving record production and deliveries. Model Y was the best-selling vehicle of any kind for 2024. That's worth noting. Not just the best \nelectric vehicle, the best vehicle of any kind on earth, number one was Model Y. We're staying focused on maximizing volumes and obviously doubling down for, I \ndon't know what, it really, I was going to say doubling down on autonomy, but really it's like autonomy is like 10x-ing. Frankly, doubling is not even enough. We \nmade many critical investments in 2024 in manufacturing AI and robotics that will bear immense fruit in the future, immense. Like it's, in fact, to such a scale that it \nis difficult to comprehend. And I've said this before, and I'll stand by it. I see a path, I'm not saying it's an easy path, but I see a path for Tesla being the most \nvaluable company in the world by far, not even close. Like, maybe several times more than, I mean, there is a path where Tesla is worth more than the next top \nfive companies combined. There's a path to that. I mean, I think it's like an incredibly, just like a difficult path, but it is an achievable path. So -- and that is \noverwhelmingly due to autonomous vehicles and autonomous humanoid robots. So, our focus is actually building towards that. And that's where we're laying the \nground. We laid the ground work for that in 2024. We'll continue to lay the ground work for that in 2025. In fact, more than laid the groundwork actually, so it would \nbe building the structure, it\u2019d be we're building the manufacturing lines and like -- like, setting up for what I think will be an epic 2026 and a ridiculous \u201827 and \u201828. \nRidiculously good. That is my prediction. As yet, very few people understand the value of Full Self Driving and our ability to monetize the fleet. I've -- some of \nthese things I've said for quite a long time and I know people said, well, Elon is the boy who cried wolf like several times but I'm telling you there's a damn wolf \nthis time and you can drive it. In fact, it can drive you. It's a self-driving wolf. For a lot of people, like their experience of Tesla autonomy is like, if it's even a year \nold, if it's even two years old, it's like meeting someone when they're like a toddler and thinking that they're going to be a toddler forever. But obviously they're not \ngoing to be a toddler forever if they grow up. But if their last experience was like, FSD was a toddler, it's like, well, it's grown up now. Have you seen it? It's like \nwalks and talks. And that's really what we've got. And it's difficult for people to understand this because human intuition is linear as opposed to what we're seeing \nis exponential progress. So, that's why my number one recommendation for anyone who doubts is simply try it. Have you tried it? When's the last time you tried \nit? And the only people who are skeptical, the only people who are skeptical are those who have not tried it. So, a car goes -- a passenger car typically has only \nabout 10 hours of utility per week out of 168. A very small percentage. Once that car is autonomous, my rough estimate is that it is in use for at least a third of the \nhours of the week. So, call it 50, maybe 55 hours of the week. And it can be useful both for cargo delivery and people delivery. So, even let's say people are \nasleep, but you can deliver packages in the middle of the night or resupply restaurants or whatever the case may be, whatever people need at all hours of the day \nor night. That same asset, the thing that these things that already exist with no incremental cost change, just a software update, now have five times or more the \nutility than they currently have. I think this will be the largest asset value increase in human history. Maybe there's something bigger, but I just don't know what it \nis. And so people who look in the rearview mirror are looking for past precedent, except I don't think there is one. So -- but the reality of autonomy is upon us. And \nI repeat my advice, try driving the car or let it drive you. So, now it works very well in the US, but of course it will over time work just as well everywhere else. So, \nwe're working hard to grow our annual volumes. Our constraint this year -- our current constraint is battery packs this year, but we're working on addressing that \nconstraint. And I think we will make progress on addressing that constraint. And then things are really going to go ballistic next year, and really ballistic in \u201827 and \n\u201828. So, yeah. So, a bit more on Full Self Driving. Our Q4 Vehicle Safety Report shows continued year-over-year improvement in safety for vehicles so that the \nsafety numbers, if somebody has supervised Full Self Driving turned on or not, the safety differences are gigantic. So, and people have seen the immense \nimprovement with Version 13 and with incremental versions in Version 13 and then Version 14 is going to be yet another step beyond that that is very significant. \nWe launched the Cortex training cluster at Gigafactory Austin, which was a significant contributor to FSD advancement, and we continue to invest in training \ninfrastructure out of Texas headquarters. So, the training needs for Optimus or Optimus humanoid robot are probably at least ultimately 10x of what's needed for \nthe car, at least to get to the full range of useful roles. You can say, how many different roles are there for a humanoid robot versus a car? Humanoid robot has \nprobably, well, 1000 times more uses and more complex things than in a car. That doesn't mean the training scales by a 1000, but it's probably 10x. Now you can \ndo this progressively. So it doesn't mean like, or Tesla is going to spend like $500 billion in training compute. Because we obviously train Optimus to do enough \ntasks to match the output of Optimus robots. And obviously, the cost of training is dropping dramatically with time. So, it is one of those things where I think \nlong-term, Optimus will be -- Optimus has the potential to be north of $10 trillion in revenue. Like, it's really bananas. So that you can obviously afford a lot of \ntraining compute in that situation. In fact, even $500 billion training compute in that situation would be quite a good deal. Yeah. The future's going to be incredibly \ndifferent from the past, that's for sure. We live at this unbelievable inflection point in human history. So, yeah. So, the proof is in the pudding. So, we're going to be \nlaunching unsupervised Full Self Driving as a paid service in Austin in June. So -- and I've talked with the team. We feel confident in being able to do an initial \nlaunch of unsupervised, no one in the car, Full Self Driving in Austin in June. We already have Tesla's operating autonomously unsupervised Full Self Driving at \nour factory in Fremont and we\u2019ll soon be doing that at our factory in Texas. So, thousands of cars every day are driving with no one in them at our Fremont factory \nin California. They will soon be doing that in Austin and then elsewhere in the world for the rest of our factories which is pretty cool. And the cars aren't just driving \nto exactly the same spot because obviously it all, [went and collide] (ph) at the same spot. The cars are actually programmed with what lane they need to park in \nto be picked up for delivery. So, they drive from the factory end of line to their specific - to their destination parking spot and then could be picked up for delivery to \ncustomers and then doing this reliably every day, thousands of times a day. It's pretty cool. Like I said, the Teslas will be in the wild with no one in them, in June \nin Austin. So, what I'm saying is this is not some far-off mythical situation. It's literally, five, six months away, five months away kind of thing. And while we're \nstepping into -- putting our toe in the water gently at first, just to make sure everything's cool, our solution is a generalized AI solution. It does not require high \nprecision maps of a locality. So we just want to be cautious. It's not that it doesn't work beyond Austin. In fact, it does. We just want to be, put a toe in the water, \nmake sure everything is okay, then put a few more toes in the water, then put a foot in the water with safety of the general public and those in the car as our top \npriority. With regard to Optimus, obviously I'm making these revenue predictions that sound absolutely insane. I realize that. But they are, I think, they will prove to \nbe accurate. Yeah. Now, with Optimus, there's a lot of uncertainty on the exact timing, because it's not like a train arriving at the station for Optimus. We are\n\ndesigning the train and the station and in real time while also building the tracks. And so they're like, people shouldn\u2019t say like, why didn't the train arrive exactly at\n12:05? We're literally designing the train and the track and the station in real time while you're saying, how can we predict this thing with absolute precision? It's\nimpossible. The normal internal plan calls for roughly 10,000 Optimus robots to be built this year. Will we succeed in building 10,000 exactly by the end of\nDecember this year? Probably not, but will we succeed in making several thousand? Yes, I think we will. Will those several thousand Optimus robots be doing\nuseful things by the end of year? Yes, I'm confident they will do useful things. The Optimus in use at the Tesla factories, production design one, will inform how -\nwhat we change for production design two, which we expect to launch next year. And our goal is to ramp prompt Optimus production faster than maybe\nanything's ever been ramped. Meaning, like aspirationally an order of magnitude ramp per year. Now, if we aspire to an order of magnitude ramp per year,\nperhaps we only end up with a half order of magnitude per year. But that's the kind of growth that we're talking about. It doesn't take very many years before we're\nmaking 100 million of these things a year. If you go up by, let's say, a factor, by 5x per year, insane. Not 50%, 500%. So, these are big growth numbers. Yeah.\nBut we do need to be -- this is an entirely new supply chain, is entirely new technology. There's nothing off the shelf to use. We try desperately with Optimus to\nuse any existing motors, any actuators, sensors, nothing worked for our humanoid robot, at any price. We had to design everything from physics first principles to\nwork for a humanoid robot and with the most sophisticated hand that has ever been made before, by far. And Optimus will be able to like play the piano and be\nable to thread a needle. I mean this is the level of precision no one has been able to achieve. And so it's really something special. So, yeah, so -- and my\nprediction long term is that Optimus will be overwhelmingly the value of the company. Regarding energy, back to Earth. Mr. Elon, can you come back here for a\nminute? Okay, back to Earth. Energy storage is a big deal and will become, it's already super important, will become incredibly important in the future. And it is\nsomething that enables far greater energy output to the grid than is currently possible. Because the grid, the grids are -- the vast majority of the grid has no\nenergy storage capability. So, they have to design the power plants to, for very high peaks and assuming that there's no energy storage. Once you have grid\nenergy storage and home-based energy storage, the actual total energy output per year of the grid is dramatically greater than people think. Maybe it's at least\ndouble. This will drive the demand of stationary battery packs, and especially the grid scale ones, to insane, basically as much demand as we could possibly\nmake. So, we have our second factory, which is in Shanghai, that's starting operation and we're building a third factory. So we're trying to ramp output of the\nstationary battery storage as quickly as possible. Now, there is a challenge here where we have to be careful to that we're not robbing from one pocket to take to\nanother pocket because for a given gigawatt hours per year of the cell output, we have to say, does it go into stationary applications or mobile applications? It\ncan't go both into both. So, we have to make that trade-off. Yeah. But overall, the demand for total gigawatt hours of batteries, whether mobile or stationary, that\nwill grow in a very, very big way over time. So, in conclusion, 2025 really is a pivotal year for Tesla. And when we look back on 2025 and the launch of\nunsupervised Full Self Driving, true real-world AI that actually works, I think they may regard it as the biggest year in Tesla history, maybe even bigger than our\nfirst car, the Roadster or the Model S, so the Model 3 or Model Y. In fact, I think it probably will be viewed \u201825 as maybe the most important year in Tesla's history.\nThere is no company in the world that is as good at real-world AI as Tesla. I don't even know who\u2019s in second place. Like, you say like who's in second place for\nreal-world AI. I would need a very big telescope to see them. That's how far behind they are.

As Elon mentioned, in Q4, we set records in vehicle deliveries and energy storage deployments in an uncertain macro \nenvironment. We were able to grow auto and energy storage volumes both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis. For this, I would like to thank the efforts of \neveryone at Tesla to make this a reality and our customers who helped us achieve this feat. Coming into the fourth quarter, our focus was to reduce inventory \nlevels in the automotive business and we accomplished that by ending the quarter with the lowest finished good inventory in the last two years. This was a result \nof offering not only attractive financing options but also other discounts and programs which impacted ASPs. While we saw volume growth in almost all regions \nthat we operate in, we hit a new record for deliveries in the Greater China market. This is an encouraging trend since we grew volume in a highly competitive BEV \nmarket. On the automotive margin front, we saw a quarter-over-quarter decline primarily due to lower ASPs and due to the recognition of FSD related revenue in \nQ3 from feature releases. Our journey on cost reduction continues, and we were able to get our overall cost per car down below $35,000, primarily by material \ncosts. This was despite increased depreciation and other costs as we prepare for the transition to the new Model Y for which we recently started taking orders in \nall markets. All our factories will start producing the new Model Y next month while we feel confident in our team\u2019s abilities to ramp production quickly, know that it \nis an unprecedented change and we are not aware of anybody else taking the best-selling car on the planet and updating all factories at the same time. This \nchangeover will result in several weeks of lost production in the quarter. As a result, margins will be impacted due to idle capacity and other ramp related costs, \nas is common in any launch, but will be overcome as production is ramped. We will be introducing several new products throughout 2025. We are still on track to \nlaunch a more affordable model in the first half of 2025 and will continue to expand our lineup from there. From a dollar-for-dollar basis, we believe we have the \nmost compelling lineup today compared to the industry, and it will continue to get better from here. As always, all our products come with the best software in the \nindustry, autonomy features and capable of full autonomy in the future. And despite the premium experience, the total cost of ownership is close to mass market, \nless premium competitors. Energy storage deployments reached an all-time high in Q4, and this -- and resulted in -- but declined sequentially. This was a result of \nhigher -- sorry, growth came from Megapack and Powerwall. Both businesses continue to be supply constrained, and like Elon mentioned, we're trying to ramp up \nproduction with Megafactory Shanghai coming online this quarter onwards. While quarterly deployments will likely continue to fluctuate sequentially, we expect at \nleast 50% growth in deployments year-over-year in 2025. Gross profit and margins in the service and other business was up year-over-year but declined \nsequentially. This was the result of higher service center costs and lower profit from used car business. The businesses within service and other primarily support \nour new car business, especially through their impact on total cost of ownership. Therefore, while we manage them to be positive on a GAAP basis, we do not \nexpect similar margins as the rest of the business. There's a lot of uncertainty around tariffs. Over the years, we've tried to localize our supply chain in every \nmarket, but we are still very reliant on parts from across the world for all our businesses. Therefore, the imposition of tariffs, which is very likely, and any \n[Indiscernible] will have an impact on our business and profitability. Our operating expenses grew both year-over-year and sequentially. The biggest driver of the \nincrease was R&D as we continue to invest in AI-related initiatives. The remaining increase came from growth in our sales capabilities and marketing efforts from \nreferral program. For 2025, we expect operating expenses to increase to support our growth initiatives. It is important to point out that the net income in Q4 was \nimpacted by a $600 million mark-to-market benefit from Bitcoin due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for digital assets, whereby we will change -- we \nwill take mark-to-market adjustments through other income every reporting period going forward. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, and despite \nCapEx increase of over $2.4 billion in 2024, we were able to generate free cash flow of $3.6 billion for the year. CapEx efficiency is something we are extremely \nfocused on. While we have invested in AI-related initiatives, we have done so in a very targeted manner to utilize the spend to get immediate benefits. The \nbuild-out of Cortex was accelerated because of the role -- actually to accelerate the rollout of FSD Version 13. Accumulative AI-related CapEx, including \ninfrastructure, so far has been approximately $5 billion. And for 2025, we expect our CapEx to be flat on a year-over-year basis. In conclusion, like Elon said, \n2025 is going to be a pivotal year for Tesla. There are a lot of investments which we have made and will continue to make in this coming year, which will set the \npace for the next phase of growth. And it is something which now I'm getting out of earth, it is going to be out of this world. And we just are putting the right\n\nfoundation.

And it's worth the next -- sometimes people say, Elon's always late. Well,\nactually, no, the problem is that the media reports on when I'm late, but never reports when I'm early. So sure, I'm optimistic, but I'm not that optimistic. There are\nmany cases in the past where I actually, we've been early, such as completion of the Shanghai factory or factory completion has generally have been ahead of\nschedule, not behind. So, yeah, so the -- but I like to say I'm very confident we'll have released unsupervised Full Self Driving fully autonomous Teslas in Austin\nand several other cities in America by the end of this year. That's probably everywhere in America next year, and everywhere in North America at least. I think in\nterms of next year our constraints, I think it's likely to be just regulatory. Like Europe really has, for example, Europe is a layer cake of regulations and\nbureaucracy, which really needs to be addressed. There's this joke like America innovates, Europe regulates. It's like, guys, there's too many refs on the field. I\nmean, for example, for us to just to release supervised Full Self Driving in Europe, even though it works really well, we have to go through a mountain of\npaperwork with the Netherlands, which is our primary regulatory authority. Then the Netherlands presents this to the EU and I think May. And there's like this big\nEU country committee. We expect it to be approved at that time, but there's nothing we can do to make that may happen sooner. In fact, nobody seems to do it.\nBut I guess all the countries would have to somehow vote in some way to have it happen sooner than May. Otherwise, it won't happen sooner than May. So then\nwhen is unsupervised FSD allowed in Europe? I\u2019m like, May next year maybe? I don't know. I have to find out when the EU is meeting again. Sometimes it's a\n12-month cadence, sometimes a six-month cadence. Then in China, which is a gigantic market, we do have some challenges because they weren't, currently\nallow us to transfer training video outside of China. And then the US government wouldn't let us do training in China. So we're in a bit of a bind there. So like, bit\nof a quandary. So we are already solving then is by literally looking at videos of streets in China that are available on the Internet to understand and then feeding\nthat into our video training so that publicly available video of street signs and traffic rules in China can be used for training and then also putting it in a very\naccurate simulator. And so it will train using SIM for bus lanes in China. Like bus lanes in China, by the way, were about the biggest challenges in making FSD\nwork in China is the bus lanes are very complicated. And there's like literally like hours of the day that you're allowed to be there and not be there. And then if you\naccidentally go in that bus lane at the wrong time, you get an automatic ticket instantly. So, it's kind of a big deal, bus lanes in China. So we're going to put that\ninto our simulator, train on that. The car has to know what time of day it is, read the sign. Anyway, we'll get this solved. But I think we'll have unsupervised FSD in\nalmost every market this year limited simply by regulatory issues, not technical capability. And then unsupervised FSD in the US this year, in many cities, but\nnationwide next year. And hopefully we have unsupervised FSD in most countries by the end of next year.
