{"doc_id": "JPM_TRANSCRIPT_2024_Q2", "ticker": "JPM", "quarter": "Q2", "filing_date": "2024-06-01", "phase": "prepared_remarks", "speaker_name": "Jeremy Barnum", "speaker_role": "unknown", "speaker_firm": null, "utterance_id": "u_0000", "utterance_type": "statement", "text": "Thank you and good morning everyone. Starting on Page one, the firm reported net income of $18.1 billion, EPS of $6.12 on revenue of $51 billion with an \nROTCE of 28%. These results included the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares and the $1 billion foundation contribution of the appreciated Visa stock. \nAlso included is $546 million of net investment securities losses in corporate. Excluding these items, the firm had net income of $13.1 billion, EPS of $4.40, and \nan ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights, in the CIB, IB fees were up 50% year-on-year and 17% quarter-on-quarter, and market revenue was up \n10% year-on-year. In CCB, we had a record number of first-time investors and strong customer acquisition across checking accounts and card and we've \ncontinued to see strong net inflows across AWM. Now before I get more detail on the results I just want to mention that starting this quarter we are no longer \nexplicitly calling out the First Republic contribution in the presentation. Going forward, we'll only specifically call it out if it is a meaningful driver in the year-on-year \ncomparison. As a reminder, we acquired First Republic in May of last year, so the prior year quarter only has two months of First Republic results compared to the \nfull three months this quarter. Also in the prior year quarter most of the expenses were in corporate whereas now they are primarily in the relevant \nline-of-business. Now turning to Page 2 for the firm-wide results. The firm reported revenue of $51 billion, up $8.6 billion, or 20% year-on-year. Excluding both the \nVisa gain that I mentioned earlier, as well as last year's First Republic bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion, revenue of $43.1 billion was up $3.4 billion or 9%. NII \nex-Markets was up $568 million or 3%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates, higher revolving balances in card, and the additional month of \nFirst Republic related NII, partially offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances. NIR ex-Markets was up $7.3 billion or 56%. Excluding the \nitems I just mentioned, it was up $2.1 billion or 21%, largely driven by higher investment banking revenue and asset management fees. Both periods included net \ninvestment securities losses. And markets revenue was up $731 million or 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $23.7 billion were up $2.9 billion or 14% year-on-year. \nExcluding the foundation contribution I previously mentioned, expenses were up 9% primarily driven by compensation including revenue related compensation \nand growth in employees. And credit costs were $3.1 billion reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $821 million. Net charge-offs were \nup $820 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card. The net reserve build included $609 million in consumer and $189 million in wholesale. Onto balance \nsheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.3% up 30 basis points versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, largely \noffset by capital distributions and higher RWA. As you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago and have already disclosed a number of the key points. \nLet me summarize them again here. Our preliminary SCB is 3.3%, although the final SCB could be higher. The preliminary SCB, which is up from the current \nrequirement of 2.9%, results in a 12.3% standardized CET1 ratio requirement, which goes into effect in the fourth quarter of 2024. And finally the firm announced \nthat the Board intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend from $1.15 to $1.25 per share in the third quarter of 2024. Now, let's go to our \nbusinesses, starting with CCB on Page 4. CCB reported net income of $4.2 billion on revenue of $17.7 billion, which was up 3% year-on-year. In banking and \nwealth management, revenue was down 5% year-on-year, reflecting lower deposits and deposit margin compression, partially offset by growth and wealth \nmanagement revenue. Average deposits were down 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter. Client investment assets were up 14% year-on-year, \npredominantly driven by market performance. In home lending, revenue of $1.3 billion was up 31% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII, including \none additional month of the First Republic portfolio. Turning to Card services and Auto, revenue was up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher Card \nNII and higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 12% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, \noriginations were $10.8 billion, down 10% coming off strong originations from a year ago, while continuing to maintain healthy margins. Expenses of $9.4 billion \nwere up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by First Republic expenses now reflected in the lines-of-business, as I mentioned earlier, as well as field \ncompensation and continued growth in technology and marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.6 billion reflecting net \ncharge-offs of $2.1 billion up $813 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card, as newer vintages season and credit normalization continues. The net \nreserve build was $579 million, also driven by Card, due to loan growth and updates to certain macroeconomic variables. Next, the Commercial and Investment \nBank on Page 5. Our new Commercial and Investment Bank reported net income of $5.9 billion on revenue of $17.9 billion. You'll note that we are disclosing \nrevenue by business, as well as breaking down the banking and payments revenue by client coverage segment in order to best highlight the relevant trends in \nboth important dimensions of the wholesale franchise. This quarter, IB fees were up 50% year-on-year, and we Ranked Number #1 with year-to-date wallet share \nof 9.5%. And advisory, fees were up 45%, primarily driven by the closing of a few large deals in a week prior year quarter. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully \nwith equity up 56% and debt up 51%, benefiting from favorable market conditions. In terms of the outlook, we're pleased with both the year-on-year and \nsequential improvement in the quarter. We remain cautiously optimistic about the pipeline, although many of the same headwinds are still in effect. It's also worth \nnoting that pull-forward refinancing activity was a meaningful contributor to the strong performance in the first half of the year. Payments revenue was $4.5 billion, \ndown 4% year-on-year, as deposit margin compression and higher deposit related client credits were largely offset by fee growth. Moving to markets, total \nrevenue was $7.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Fixed income was up 5% with continued strength in securitized products. And equity markets was up 21%, with \nequity derivatives up on improved client activity. We saw record revenue in Prime on growth and client balances amid supportive equity market levels. Security \nservices revenue of $1.3 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher volumes and market levels, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of \n$9.2 billion were up 12% year-on-year, largely driven by higher revenue related compensation, legal expense, and volume related non-compensation expense. In \nbanking and payments, average loans were up 2% year-on-year due to the impact of the First Republic acquisition and flat sequentially. Demand for new loans \nremains muted as middle market and large corporate clients remain somewhat cautious due to the economic environment, and revolver utilization continues to be \nbelow pre-pandemic levels. Also, capital markets are open and are providing an alternative to traditional bank lending for these clients. In CRE, higher rates \ncontinue to suppress both loan origination and payoff activity. Average client deposits were up 2% year-on-year and relatively flat sequentially. Finally, credit \ncosts were $384 million. The net reserve build of $220 million was primarily driven by incorporating the First Republic portfolio in the Firm's modeled approach. \nNet charge-offs were $164 million, of which about half was in office. Then to complete our lines-of-business, AWM on Page 6. Asset and wealth management \nreported net income of $1.3 billion with pre-tax margin of 32%. Revenue of $5.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher \naverage market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher brokerage activity, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.5 billion were up \n12% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, primarily revenue-related compensation, and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams.\n\nFor the quarter, long-term net inflows were $52 billion, led by equities and fixed income. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $16 billion. AUM of $3.7 trillion was\nup 15% year-on-year. And client assets of $5.4 trillion were up 18% year-on-year, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans and\ndeposits were both flat quarter-on-quarter. Turning to corporate on Page 7. Corporate reported net income of $6.8 billion on revenue of $10.1 billion. Excluding\nthis quarter's Visa-related gain and the First Republic bargain purchase gain in the prior year, NIR was up approximately $450 million year-on-year. NII was up\n$626 million year-on-year, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates. Expenses of $1.6 billion were up $427 million year-on-year, excluding\nfoundation contribution expenses were down $573 million year-on-year, largely as a result of moving First Republic related expense out of corporate into the\nrelevant segments. To finish up, we have the outlook on Page 8. Our 2024 guidance, including the drivers, remains unchanged from what we said at Investor\nDay. We continue to expect NII and NII ex-markets of approximately $91 billion, adjusted expense of about $92 billion, and on credit, Card net charge-off rate of\napproximately 3.4%. So to wrap up, the reported performance for the quarter was exceptional and actually represents record revenue and net income. But more\nimportantly, after excluding the significant items, the underlying performance continues to be quite strong. And as always, we remain focused on continuing to\nexecute with discipline. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.\nOperator\nFor our first question, we'll go to the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research.

Just given some indications that the Fed is considering favorable revisions to both Basel III endgame and the\nGSIB surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for some time. As you evaluate just different capital scenarios, are these revisions material\nenough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus a 17% target? And if so, just how that might impact or inform your appetite for\nbuybacks going forward?", "char_count": 500, "word_count": 84, "token_count": 104, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "JPM_TRANSCRIPT_2024_Q2_u_0003", "company": "JPM", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2024, "period": "2024-Q2", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/JPM/JPM_FY2024_Q2.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

Thanks Steve. And actually before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because he has a travel\nconflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today. Okay. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my\nanswer to that question would be no. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward\nrevision on ROTCE. If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that you know before the Basel III endgame proposal, we had a 17%\nthrough cycle target and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. And while we\nhad ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that\nwould actually increase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed. So as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to\nthe next point, which is yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage you've been reading and you know, it's fun and interesting to speculate about the\npotential outcomes here, but in reality, we don't know anything -- you don't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so in that sense, I feel\nlike on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then,\nthe comments that Jamie made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made subsequent week at an industry conference. So maybe I'll just briefly summarize\nfor everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is one, we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an\never-expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously we're going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to\nour requirements. So after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of the deployment of the Capital one way or another is a matter of when, not if. On the\ncapital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. You know, growing the business organically and\ninorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the Board's announced intention to increase it to a $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to\nlast year, so that's a testament for our performance and that is a return of capital. And then finally buyback, but that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100%\nof the capital generation in any given quarter. And so, as we said here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the\ncapital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the Firm, it is kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for\npatients. So given all that, putting it all together I'm sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital. And as Jamie has\nsaid, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store, as much as anything else.", "char_count": 3302, "word_count": 582, "token_count": 710, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "JPM_TRANSCRIPT_2024_Q2_u_0004", "company": "JPM", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2024, "period": "2024-Q2", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/JPM/JPM_FY2024_Q2.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

That was a really helpful perspective. Maybe just for my follow-up on NII. You've been very consistent just in flagging the risk\nrelated to NII over earning, especially in light of potential deposit attrition, as well as repricing headwinds. In the second quarter, we did see at least some\nmoderation in repricing pressures. Deposit balances were also more resilient in what's a seasonally weak quarter for deposit growth. So just given the evidence\nthat some deposit pressures appear to be abating. Do you see the potential for NII normalizing higher?

Interesting question, Steve. So let's talk about deposit balances. So yes I see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating. When you look at \nthe system as a whole, just to go through it, Q2 is still a bit of a headwind. Loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that. And RRP seems to have settled \nin roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more, although that could always change and that could \nsupply extra reserves into the system. But on balance, net across all those various effects, we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances. So \nwhen we think of our balance outlook, we see it as flat to slightly down maybe, with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those system-wide \nheadwinds. So in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what. But I think it is definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the over\n\nearning narrative or the normalization narrative. Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year, which implied a lot\nmore sequential decline, is just the change in the Fed outlook. So two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there. But obviously, based on the latest\ncompletion data and so on, you could usually get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield curve. So we'll see how it goes.

Thanks, Ken. It's progress, right? I mean we are happy to see the progress. People have been talking about [depressed] (ph) banking fee wallet for some\ntime, and it's nice to see not only the year-on-year pop on the low base, but also a nice sequential improvement. So that's the first thing to say. In terms of\ndialogue and engagement, it's definitely elevated. So as the dialogue on ECM is elevated and the dialogue on M&A is quite robust as well. So all of those are\ngood things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space. But there are some important caveats. So on the\nDCM side, yes, we made pull-forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second quarter still reflects a bunch of pull forward, and therefore we\nare reasonably cautious about the second half of the year. Importantly, a lot of the activity is refinancing activity as opposed to for example, acquisition finance.\nSo the fact that M&A remains still relatively muted in terms of actual deals has knock-on effects on DCM as well. And when a higher percentage of the wallet is\nrefi, then the pull-forward risk becomes a little bit higher. On ECM, if you look at it kind of at [remove] (ph), you might ask the question, given the performance of\nthe overall indices, you would think it would be a really booming environment for IPOs, for example. And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would\notherwise expect. And that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that as has been widely discussed, that extent to which the performance of the large\nindustries is driven by like a few stocks, the sort of mid-cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had much more muted\nperformance. Also, a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple of years ago was raised at pretty high valuations. And so in some cases, people looking at\nIPOs could be looking at down rounds, that's an issue. And while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in some cases, people still\nhave concerns about that. So those are a little bit of overhang on that space. I think we can hope that, over time that fades away and the trend gets a bit more\nrobust. And yes, on the advisory side, the regulatory overhang is there, remains there.

I think -- I guess one way the environment is evolving a little bit is that as you know,\na lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals.

So the space is a little bit quieter than it was at the margin. Another\ninteresting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated lender finance market making their way into\nthe private market as well, is sort of people realize that even in the private market, you probably need some of those protections in some cases. Which is sort of\nsupportive of the theme that we've been talking about, about convergence between the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of\nour core thesis here, which is that we can offer best-in-class service across the entire continuum, including secondary market trading and so on. So we feel\noptimistic about our offering there. I think the current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was. So it is maybe not a great moment to like kind of test\nwhether we are doing a lot more or less in the space, so to speak.

But when we look at the fund's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both like the [EAR type lens] (ph), the short-term NIR sensitivity, but\nalso a variety of other lenses, including various types of scenario analysis, including impacts on capital from higher rates. And as I think Jamie has said a couple\nof times, we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front. Also, given like the inverted yield curve, it's not as if extending duration from these levels means\nthat you're walking in 5.5% rate. In fact, the forwards are not sort of that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation\nand so on.

Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess the way I think about it is a couple of things. Like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right? So if you kind of build\nyourself out a full year forecast and make reasonable space on your own, or analyst consensus or whatever, and you think about the fourth quarter, better look at\nthis on a full year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers, and you obviously have to strip out kind of the onetime items. And so if you\ndo that, like whatever you get for this year is still clearly a number that's higher than 17%. So yes, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily\nas a result of the expected higher deposit costs. That's -- we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at\nsome point. And in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very supplemental model of the company, you would have like expenses grow -- revenue is\ngrowing at some organic GDP like rate, maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate, producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio.\nBut even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point, you still have some background -- you still have\nsome normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen. So as much as our discipline on expense management is, as tight as it always has been, the\ninflation is still non-zero. There are still investments that we're executing. There is still higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result\nof in part, the normalization of NII. And then the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III endgame and all the other pieces, you have to\nassume some amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far. So of course, any of those pieces could be wrong, but that's kind\nof how we get to our 17%. And if you look at the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my Investor Day presentation, it illustrates those dynamics\nand also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors.\nMatt O'Connor\nYes. That was a really helpful chart. Just one follow-up. On the yield curve effects, I guess, what do you mean by that?

But when the steepness of the curve implies -- is driven by the\nexpectation of actually aggressive Fed tightening, it's just a timing issue and you can wind up kind of pretty offside from the capital and other perspectives. So\nthere are some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the road and whether that could be sort\nof -- earning the term premium, so to speak, could be a source of NII, but that feels a bit speculative to me at this point.\nMatt O'Connor\nGot it.

That's a very good and fair question, Betsy. So let me try to unpack it to the best of my abilities. So -- in no particular order. One thing that we've really tried\nto emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10-Qs actually, is that we don't want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks. So\nwe're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of -- and we prefer the right to sort of change that at any time. So I recognize\nthat not everyone loves that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief. And so I might as well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the [Q] (ph) also, but I'm just\ngoing to say that again. So that's point one. But having said that, let me nonetheless try to address your point on framework and governors. So generally\nspeaking, we think it doesn't make sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now, let's say.\nObviously, when for whatever reason, if we ever need to build capital in a hurry, we've done it before and we are always comfortable suspending buybacks\nentirely. But I think some modest amount of buybacks, is a reasonable thing to do when you are generating your kind of capital. And so we were talking before\nabout this $2 billion pace, we're kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace, but that's where that idea comes from, let's put it that way. You talked\nabout the $4.9 million, which I recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number. But where that actually comes from is the other statement that we made,\nthat we have these significant item gains from Visa. And if you think about what that means, it means that we have, post the acceptance of the exchange offer, a\nmeaningful long position and liquid large cap financial stock, i.e. Visa, which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock. And so in some sense, why carry\nthat instead of just buying back JPMorgan stock. So we talked about, Jamie talked about as we liquidate the Visa, deploying those proceeds into JPM, and that's\nwhat we did this quarter. So that is why the 4.9% is a little higher. And it's consistent with my comments at our Investor Day around having slightly increased the\namount of buybacks. And beyond that what you are left with is answer to Steve's question, which is that, to your point about buying back earnings or whatever,\nwhen we are generating these types of earnings and there is this much organic capital being generated, in the absence of opportunities to deploy it organically or\ninorganically and while continuing to maintain our healthy but sustainable dividend, if we don't return the capital, we are going to keep growing the CET1 ratio, the\nlevels of which -- if you think about the long strategic outlook of the company, are not reasonable. They're just artificially high and unnecessary. So one way or the\nother, that will need to be addressed at some point.

Good question, Gerard. I have to be honest, I haven't focused on that particular sequential explain i.e., quarter-on-quarter change and average\nnon-interest-bearing deposits. But I think the more important question is the big picture question, which is what do we expect? I mean how are we thinking about\nongoing migration of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing in the current environment, and how that affects our NII outlook and our expectation for weighted\naverage rate paid on deposits. And the answer to that question is that we do continue to expect that migration to happen. So if you think about it in the wholesale\nspace, you have a bunch of clients with some balances in non-interest-bearing accounts, and over time for a variety of reasons, we do see them moving those\nbalances into interest-bearing. So we do continue to expect that migration to happen, and therefore, that will be a source of headwinds. And that migration\nsometimes happens internally, i.e., out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing or into CDs. Sometimes it goes into money markets or into investments, which\nis what we see happening in our Wealth Management business. And some of it does leave the company. But one of the things that we are encouraged by is the\nextent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that yield-seeking flow through CDs and money market offerings, et cetera, across our various\nfranchises. So big picture. I do think that migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing will continue to be a thing, and that is a contributor to the\nmodest headwinds that we expect for NII right now.

Good question. So yes, trading assets have been up. That is basically client activity primarily secured financing related sort of matchbook repo type\nstuff and similar things that are -- grows up the balance sheet quite a bit, but are quite low risk and therefore quite low RWA intensity. So while our ability the\nsupply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and it's very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients. It's not really\nparticularly RWA, and therefore capital intensive, and therefore it doesn't really reflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak. On the loan\ndemand front, yes, I mean, unfortunately, I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand. Meaning, to your point, loan demand remains quite muted\neverywhere except Card. Our Card business is, of course, in no way capital constrained. So whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer\nfranchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts, and what fits inside our credit risk appetite is growth that's going to make sense. And so we're\nvery happy to deploy capital to that. But it's not constrained by our willingness or ability to deploy capital to that. And of course, for the rest of the loan space, the\nlast thing that we are going to do is have the excess capital mean that we lean in to lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, especially in\na world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure. So there is always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic\nrisk rationally. And frankly, that is in some sense, a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now.
