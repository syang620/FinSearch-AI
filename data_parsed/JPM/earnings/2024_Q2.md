## Prepared Remarks

### Jeremy Barnum (Unknown)

Thank you and good morning everyone. Starting on Page one, the firm reported net income of $18.1 billion, EPS of $6.12 on revenue of $51 billion with an 
ROTCE of 28%. These results included the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares and the $1 billion foundation contribution of the appreciated Visa stock. 
Also included is $546 million of net investment securities losses in corporate. Excluding these items, the firm had net income of $13.1 billion, EPS of $4.40, and 
an ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights, in the CIB, IB fees were up 50% year-on-year and 17% quarter-on-quarter, and market revenue was up 
10% year-on-year. In CCB, we had a record number of first-time investors and strong customer acquisition across checking accounts and card and we've 
continued to see strong net inflows across AWM. Now before I get more detail on the results I just want to mention that starting this quarter we are no longer 
explicitly calling out the First Republic contribution in the presentation. Going forward, we'll only specifically call it out if it is a meaningful driver in the year-on-year 
comparison. As a reminder, we acquired First Republic in May of last year, so the prior year quarter only has two months of First Republic results compared to the 
full three months this quarter. Also in the prior year quarter most of the expenses were in corporate whereas now they are primarily in the relevant 
line-of-business. Now turning to Page 2 for the firm-wide results. The firm reported revenue of $51 billion, up $8.6 billion, or 20% year-on-year. Excluding both the 
Visa gain that I mentioned earlier, as well as last year's First Republic bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion, revenue of $43.1 billion was up $3.4 billion or 9%. NII 
ex-Markets was up $568 million or 3%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates, higher revolving balances in card, and the additional month of 
First Republic related NII, partially offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances. NIR ex-Markets was up $7.3 billion or 56%. Excluding the 
items I just mentioned, it was up $2.1 billion or 21%, largely driven by higher investment banking revenue and asset management fees. Both periods included net 
investment securities losses. And markets revenue was up $731 million or 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $23.7 billion were up $2.9 billion or 14% year-on-year. 
Excluding the foundation contribution I previously mentioned, expenses were up 9% primarily driven by compensation including revenue related compensation 
and growth in employees. And credit costs were $3.1 billion reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $821 million. Net charge-offs were 
up $820 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card. The net reserve build included $609 million in consumer and $189 million in wholesale. Onto balance 
sheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.3% up 30 basis points versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, largely 
offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. As you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago and have already disclosed a number of the key points. 
Let me summarize them again here. Our preliminary SCB is 3.3%, although the final SCB could be higher. The preliminary SCB, which is up from the current 
requirement of 2.9%, results in a 12.3% standardized CET1 ratio requirement, which goes into effect in the fourth quarter of 2024. And finally the firm announced 
that the Board intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend from $1.15 to $1.25 per share in the third quarter of 2024. Now, let's go to our 
businesses, starting with CCB on Page 4. CCB reported net income of $4.2 billion on revenue of $17.7 billion, which was up 3% year-on-year. In banking and 
wealth management, revenue was down 5% year-on-year, reflecting lower deposits and deposit margin compression, partially offset by growth and wealth 
management revenue. Average deposits were down 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter. Client investment assets were up 14% year-on-year, 
predominantly driven by market performance. In home lending, revenue of $1.3 billion was up 31% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII, including 
one additional month of the First Republic portfolio. Turning to Card services and Auto, revenue was up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher Card 
NII and higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 12% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, 
originations were $10.8 billion, down 10% coming off strong originations from a year ago, while continuing to maintain healthy margins. Expenses of $9.4 billion 
were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by First Republic expenses now reflected in the lines-of-business, as I mentioned earlier, as well as field 
compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.6 billion reflecting net 
charge-offs of $2.1 billion up $813 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card, as newer vintages season and credit normalization continues. The net 
reserve build was $579 million, also driven by Card, due to loan growth and updates to certain macroeconomic variables. Next, the Commercial and Investment 
Bank on Page 5. Our new Commercial and Investment Bank reported net income of $5.9 billion on revenue of $17.9 billion. You'll note that we are disclosing 
revenue by business, as well as breaking down the banking and payments revenue by client coverage segment in order to best highlight the relevant trends in 
both important dimensions of the wholesale franchise. This quarter, IB fees were up 50% year-on-year, and we Ranked Number #1 with year-to-date wallet share 
of 9.5%. And advisory, fees were up 45%, primarily driven by the closing of a few large deals in a week prior year quarter. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully 
with equity up 56% and debt up 51%, benefiting from favorable market conditions. In terms of the outlook, we're pleased with both the year-on-year and 
sequential improvement in the quarter. We remain cautiously optimistic about the pipeline, although many of the same headwinds are still in effect. It's also worth 
noting that pull-forward refinancing activity was a meaningful contributor to the strong performance in the first half of the year. Payments revenue was $4.5 billion, 
down 4% year-on-year, as deposit margin compression and higher deposit related client credits were largely offset by fee growth. Moving to markets, total 
revenue was $7.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Fixed income was up 5% with continued strength in securitized products. And equity markets was up 21%, with 
equity derivatives up on improved client activity. We saw record revenue in Prime on growth and client balances amid supportive equity market levels. Security 
services revenue of $1.3 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher volumes and market levels, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of 
$9.2 billion were up 12% year-on-year, largely driven by higher revenue related compensation, legal expense, and volume related non-compensation expense. In 
banking and payments, average loans were up 2% year-on-year due to the impact of the First Republic acquisition and flat sequentially. Demand for new loans 
remains muted as middle market and large corporate clients remain somewhat cautious due to the economic environment, and revolver utilization continues to be 
below pre-pandemic levels. Also, capital markets are open and are providing an alternative to traditional bank lending for these clients. In CRE, higher rates 
continue to suppress both loan origination and payoff activity. Average client deposits were up 2% year-on-year and relatively flat sequentially. Finally, credit 
costs were $384 million. The net reserve build of $220 million was primarily driven by incorporating the First Republic portfolio in the Firm's modeled approach. 
Net charge-offs were $164 million, of which about half was in office. Then to complete our lines-of-business, AWM on Page 6. Asset and wealth management 
reported net income of $1.3 billion with pre-tax margin of 32%. Revenue of $5.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher 
average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher brokerage activity, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.5 billion were up 
12% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, primarily revenue-related compensation, and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams.

For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $52 billion, led by equities and fixed income. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $16 billion. AUM of $3.7 trillion was
up 15% year-on-year. And client assets of $5.4 trillion were up 18% year-on-year, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans and
deposits were both flat quarter-on-quarter. Turning to corporate on Page 7. Corporate reported net income of $6.8 billion on revenue of $10.1 billion. Excluding
this quarter's Visa-related gain and the First Republic bargain purchase gain in the prior year, NIR was up approximately $450 million year-on-year. NII was up
$626 million year-on-year, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates. Expenses of $1.6 billion were up $427 million year-on-year, excluding
foundation contribution expenses were down $573 million year-on-year, largely as a result of moving First Republic related expense out of corporate into the
relevant segments. To finish up, we have the outlook on Page 8. Our 2024 guidance, including the drivers, remains unchanged from what we said at Investor
Day. We continue to expect NII and NII ex-markets of approximately $91 billion, adjusted expense of about $92 billion, and on credit, Card net charge-off rate of
approximately 3.4%. So to wrap up, the reported performance for the quarter was exceptional and actually represents record revenue and net income. But more
importantly, after excluding the significant items, the underlying performance continues to be quite strong. And as always, we remain focused on continuing to
execute with discipline. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.

For our first question, we'll go to the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.

## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Ken Usdin (Jefferies)**: Thanks a lot. Good morning Jeremy. Jeremy, great to see the progress on investment banking fees, up sequentially and 50% year-over-year. And I saw you on
the tape earlier just talking about still regulatory concerns a little bit in the advisory space. And we clearly didn't see the debt pull-forward play through, because
DCM was great again. I'm just wondering just where you feel the environment is relative to the potential. And just where the dialogue is across the three main
bucket areas in terms of like how does this feel in terms of current environment versus a potential environment that we could still see ahead? Thanks.

### Exchange 002

**Ken Usdin (Jefferies)**: Great. Thank you for all that Jeremy. And just one on the consumer side. Just anything you're noticing in terms of people who just have been waiting for this
delinquency stabilization on the credit card side. Obviously, your loss rates are coming in as you expected, and we did see 30 days pretty flat and 90 days come
down a little bit. Any -- is that seasonal? Is it just a good rate of change trend? Any thoughts there? Thanks.

### Exchange 003

**Ken Usdin (Jefferies)**: Thank you.

### Exchange 004

**Glenn Schorr (Evercore)**: Hi, thanks very much. So Jeremy, the discussions so far around private credit and you all, your recent comments have been the ability to add on balance sheet
and compete when you need to compete on the private credit front. I do think that most of the discussion has been about the direct-lending component. So I'm
curious if you are showing more progress and activity on that front. And then very importantly, do you see the same trend happening on the asset-backed finance
side, because that's a bigger part of the world, and it is a bigger part of your business? So I'd appreciate your thoughts there. Thanks.

### Exchange 005

**Glenn Schorr (Evercore)**: That's great for you if you are not hearing much about it, so we can leave it at that. Maybe just one quick follow-up in terms of your just overall posturing on -- you 
were patient and smart when rates were low, waited to deploy, worked out great. We know that story. Now it seems like you have tons of excess liquidity and you

are being patient and rates are high. And I'm curious on how you think about what kind of triggers, what kind of things you're looking for in the market to know if
and when you would extend duration?

### Exchange 006

**Glenn Schorr (Evercore)**: Super, helpful. Thanks so much for that.

### Exchange 007

**Mike Mayo (Wells Fargo)**: Hi. Jeremy, you said it's too early to end the over earning narrative, and you highlighted higher deposit costs and the impact of lower rates and lower NII and
DCM pull-forward and credit cost going higher. Anything I'm missing on that list? And what would cause you to end the over earning narrative?

### Exchange 008

**Mike Mayo (Wells Fargo)**: You're 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE kind of expectation, what is the CET1 ratio that you assumed for that?

### Exchange 009

**Mike Mayo (Wells Fargo)**: Let me just zoom out for one more question on the return target. I mean when I asked Jamie at the [2013] (ph) Investor Day would it make sense to have 13.5%
capital, he was basically telling you take a hike, right? And now you have 15.3% capital and you're saying, well, we might want to have a lot more capital here. I
mean at some point, if you're spending $17 billion a year to improve the company, if you're gaining share with digital banking, if you're automating the back office,
if you're moving ahead with AI, if you're doing all these things that I think you say others aren't doing, why wouldn't those returns go higher over time? Or do you
just assume you'll be competing those benefits away? Thanks.

### Exchange 010

**Mike Mayo (Wells Fargo)**: All right. Thank you.
Operator
Next, we'll go to the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

### Exchange 011

**Betsy Graseck (Morgan Stanley)**: Hi, Jeremy.

### Exchange 012

**Betsy Graseck (Morgan Stanley)**: So I did want to ask one drill-down question on 2Q, and it is related to the dollar amount of buybacks that you did do. I think in the press release, right and the
slide deck, it's $4.9 billion common stock net repurchases. So the question here is what's the governor for you on how much to do every quarter? And I mean I
understand it is a function of okay, how much do we organically grow. But even with that, so you get the organic growth which you had some nice movement
there. But you do the organic growth and then is it how much do we earn and we want to buy back our earnings? Or how should we be thinking about what that
repurchase volume should be looking like over time? And I remember at Investor Day, the whole debate around I don't want to buy back my stock, but we are
right? So I get this question from investors quite a bit of how should we be thinking about how you think about what the right amount is to be doing here?

### Exchange 013

**Betsy Graseck (Morgan Stanley)**: Great. Thank you Jeremy. Appreciate it.

### Exchange 014

**Gerard Cassidy (RBC)**: Hi, Jeremy, how are you?

### Exchange 015

**Gerard Cassidy (RBC)**: Jeremy, can you -- I know you touched on deposits earlier in the call in response to a question. I noticed on the average balances, the non-interest bearing
deposits were relatively stable quarter-to-quarter versus prior quarters when they have steadily declined. And this is one of the areas, of course investors are
focused on in terms of the future of the net interest margin for you and your peers. Can you elaborate, if you can, what you're seeing in that non-interest-bearing
deposit account? I know this is average and not period end, the period end number may actually be lower. But what are you guys seeing here?

### Exchange 016

**Gerard Cassidy (RBC)**: Very good. And as a follow-up, you've been very clear about the consumer credit card charge-offs and delinquency levels. And we all know about the commercial
real estate office, and you always talk about over-earning on net interest income of course. One of the great credit quality stories for everyone, including
yourselves, is the C&I portfolio, how strong it's been for -- in this elevated rate environment. And I know your numbers are still quite low, but in the Corporate and

### Exchange 017

**Gerard Cassidy (RBC)**: Great, appreciate the insights as always. Thank you.

### Exchange 018

**Erika Najarian (UBS)**: Hi, good morning. I just had one cleanup question, Jeremy. The consensus provision for 2024 is $10.7 billion. Could you maybe clarify for once and for all sort of
Jamie's comments at an industry conference earlier and try to sort of triangulate if that $10.7 billion provision is appropriate for the growth level that you are
planning for in Card?

### Exchange 019

**Erika Najarian (UBS)**: Great. Thank you.
