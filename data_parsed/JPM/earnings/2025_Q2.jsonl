{"doc_id": "JPM_2025_Q2", "ticker": "JPM", "year": 2025, "quarter": 2, "filing_date": "2025-06-01", "phase": "prepared_remarks", "speaker_name": "Jeremy Barnum", "speaker_role": "Unknown", "speaker_firm": null, "utterance_id": "u_0000", "utterance_type": "statement", "text": "Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. This quarter, the firm reported net income of $15 billion, EPS of $5.24 on revenue of $45.7 billion, with an\nROTCE of 21%. These results included an income tax benefit of $774 million, which we described in more detail in the earnings press release. On the next page,\nwe have some more detail. The firm reported revenue of $45.7 billion, down $5.3 billion, or 10% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was down $185 million, or 1%,\ndriven by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression, predominantly offset by higher wholesale deposits, higher revolving balances in Card, as\nwell as the impact of securities activity, including from prior quarters. NIR ex Markets was down $6.3 billion, or 31%, and excluding the net gain related to Visa\nshares and net investment securities losses in the prior year was up $1 billion, or 8%, driven by higher Asset Management fees, higher auto lease income, higher\nInvestment Banking fees and higher Payments fees. And Markets revenue was up $1.1 billion or 15%. Expenses of $23.8 billion were up $66 million, and\nexcluding last year's Visa stock contribution to the firm's Foundation was up $1.1 billion, or 5%, primarily driven by compensation, higher brokerage and\ndistribution fees as well as higher auto lease depreciation. And credit costs were $2.8 billion, with net charge-offs of $2.4 billion, and a net reserve build of $439\nmillion. The build was driven by new lending activity, largely offset by a decrease in the probabilities that we attached to the adverse scenarios and the allowance\nestimation. On to the balance sheet on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, down 40 basis points versus the prior quarter as net income was\nmore than offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter's higher RWA is primarily driven by an increase in wholesale lending across both CIB\nmarkets and banking, an increase in other markets activity as well as an increase in Card loans. As you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago.\nUnder the current rules, our indicative SCB is floored at 2.5% and goes into effect in 4Q '25. Our new SCB also reflects the Board's intention to increase the\ndividend to $1.50 per share in the third quarter. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB. CCB reported net income of $5.2 billion on revenue of $18.8\nbillion, which was up 6% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management revenue was up 3%, largely driven by growth in Wealth Management revenue with\ndeposit NII relatively flat. Average deposits were down 1% year-on-year and flat sequentially. Client investment assets were up 14% year-on-year, driven by\nmarket performance and continued healthy flows into managed products. In Home Lending revenue was down 5% year-on-year, predominantly driven by lower\nNII. Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 15% year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances, as well as higher\noperating lease income in Auto. Card outstandings were up 9% due to strong new card acquisition. In Auto originations were up 5%, driven by higher lease\nvolumes. Expenses of $9.9 billion were up 5% year-on-year largely driven by growth in technology and auto lease depreciation. Credit costs were $2.1 billion,\nreflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion, relatively flat year-on-year, in line with expectations. Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income\nof $6.7 billion, on revenue of $19.5 billion, which was up 9% year-on-year. IB fees were up 7% year-on-year. We continue to rank #1 with wallet share of 8.9%. In\nadvisory fees were up 8%, benefiting from increased sponsor activity. Debt underwriting fees were up 12%, primarily driven by a few large deals. In equity\nunderwriting fees were down 6% year-on-year. Our pipeline remains robust, and the outlook along with the market tone and sentiment is notably more upbeat.\nPayments revenue was up 3% year-on-year, excluding equity investments driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, predominantly offset by deposit\nmargin compression. Lending revenue was down 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher losses on hedges. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was up 15%\nyear-on-year. Fixed income was up 14% with improved performance in Currencies & Emerging Markets, Rates and Commodities. This was partially offset by\nfewer opportunities in Securitized Products and Fixed Income Financing. Equities was up 15%. We continue to see strong performance across products, most\nnotably in derivatives. Security Services revenue was up 12% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth. Expenses of $9.6 billion were up\n5% year-on-year, driven by higher compensation, brokerage and technology expense, partially offset by lower legal expense. Average Banking & Payments loans\nwere down 2% year-on-year and up 2% quarter-on-quarter with sequential growth, primarily driven by new loans with larger corporates. Average client deposits\nwere up 16% year-on-year and up 5% sequentially, reflecting increased activity across Payments and Security Services. Finally, Credit costs were $696 million,\ndriven by builds in our C&I portfolio, including new lending activity and downgrades to a handful of names, partially offset by the scenario probability adjustment, I\nmentioned upfront. Turning to Asset & Wealth Management to complete our lines of business. AWM reported net income of $1.5 billion with a pretax margin of\n34%. Revenue of $5.8 billion was up 10% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, as well as\nhigher brokerage activity and higher deposit balances. Expenses of $3.7 billion were up 5% year-on-year driven by higher compensation, including\nrevenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $31\nbillion for the quarter led by fixed income and equities. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $5 billion. AUM of $4.3 trillion was up 18% year-on-year, and client assets\nof $6.4 trillion were up 19% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 7% year-on-year and 3%\nquarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. Turning to Corporate. Corporate reported net income of $1.7 billion and includes\nthe tax item I mentioned upfront. Revenue was $1.5 billion for the quarter. NII was $1.5 billion, down $875 million year-on-year, NIR was a net gain of $49 million,\nup $148 million year-on-year, excluding the prior year's Visa-related gains. Expenses of $547 million were down $32 million year-on-year, excluding the\nFoundation contribution in the prior year that I mentioned earlier. To finish up, I'll touch on the outlook. You'll recall that at Investor Day, I made a couple of\ncomments previewing the potential evolution of the outlook. So now let me formalize that and give you updated guidance. First, we now expect NII ex Markets to\nbe approximately $92 billion, with the increase driven by changes in the forward curve and strong deposit growth in Payments, Security Services as well as\nbalanced growth in Card. Total NII guidance is now about $95.5 billion, implying $3.5 billion of Markets NII. Second, on adjusted expense, we now expect it to be\nabout $95.5 billion, primarily driven by the impact of the weaker dollar, which is largely bottom line neutral. And finally, on credit, we continue to expect the Card\nnet charge-off rate to be approximately 3.6%. So reflecting on the quarter, while the environment remains extremely dynamic in many ways, navigating\nuncertainty is the norm for both us and our clients. But we're now happy to take your questions. So let's open the line for Q&A.\nOperator\nOur first question will come from Christopher McGratty with QBW (sic) [ KBW ].\n\nChristopher McGratty\nJamie, relative to 3 months ago, there's a lot of optimism on financial deregulation and really going to break in the bank's favor. I'm interested if you agree,\nnumber one, with this optimism and anything specifically you could point to? And secondarily, on capital, I'm interested in what's on or off the table in terms of\nuses of capital? What do you need to see from the macro regulatory? And how should we be thinking about the timing?", "char_count": 8364, "word_count": 1352, "token_count": 1915, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

So we have our standard capital hierarchy that we recite a lot, and I want to bore you by reciting it again. But I think it's\nimportant because it does serve as a guide in this context, right? So we deploy our capital against organic and inorganic growth, and we ensure a sustainable\ndividend. And with what's left, we do buybacks. And so we've talked about how excess capital is earnings in store. You saw this quarter that we actually had\nsome financial resource usage that came through and actually meant that despite keeping the buybacks relatively constant and having organic capital generation\nto be relatively constant, the CET1 ratio dropped a little bit as a function of increased usage organically showing up in RWA expansion. So we're doing what we\nwant to do, but clearly, it is a big amount of excess, and that does mean that everything is on the table as it always is, and that includes potentially inorganic\nthings. Now obviously, that needs to be done carefully. I think acquisitions have a high bar, both financially, strategically and importantly, in some cases,\nculturally. And we also need to think carefully about things that work outside the regulated perimeter might not work inside the regulated perimeter as well. We\nhave learned some lessons. We don't want to overlearn those lessons. But in the end, sometimes we lean in a little more, sometimes lean in a little less, but we\nwouldn't be doing our jobs if we weren't thinking about it. I don't particularly think other than fundamentally whether things are permissible or not, that the\nregulatory environment right now, particularly shapes our thinking on that front.", "char_count": 1687, "word_count": 288, "token_count": 353, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

I think they should be looking at all these things. But if you look at SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III, FSRT, the overlap, the\nduplication, I actually believe that you can make the system simpler, cheaper, more effective, more transparent and safer. And the things like Silicon Valley Bank\nand First Republic did not need to happen if you just modify some things and you can create more liquidity, more loans and a safer system. And that's really what\nthey should be looking at, not just SLR. And so I'm hoping that over time, they do that. And then second thing that I would add to that, which I think is even maybe\nmore important, is they should answer the question, what do they actually want in our public markets versus our private markets, et cetera. We've gone from\n8,000 public companies, I'm talking about like 25 years ago to 4,000 today. That's happened overseas. Public markets overseas have gotten smaller and smaller.\nObviously, I'm not against private credit. Private credit is growing. And how do you really want to structure this? And why is it happen? Is that a good thing for\nAmerica? And so I just -- it is time that they take a step back. There's been -- I hear some time from some pundits that there's been relaxing of rules and\nregulations, absolutely not. There's been nothing but increasing them for the better part of 15 years. They should take a deep breath, step back, and look at the\nsystem and answer the question, how can we make it better and stronger for the economy and all involved.", "char_count": 1552, "word_count": 278, "token_count": 355, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

I will note that Vice Chair Bowman gave a speech on her vision\nhaving come into the new seat for ongoing work on regulation. And I think it's a speech that's pretty comprehensive and lays out some of what Jamie is saying in\nterms of like the to-do list. I think at the margin, we can do understand the desire to sort of knock some things off the to-do list that have been on it for a long time\nand clearly needs to be addressed like SLR. But at the same time that, that happens, the holistic review done properly across not only capital, but also liquidity,\nresolution, et cetera, is clearly quite important. More narrowly, in the near term, I think we continue to feel very strongly that if all the things that are out there, one\nof the worst is G-SIB, in the sense of both the original gold-plating, the sort of deep conceptual flaws in the framework itself, and the failure to recalibrate it for\ngrowth since it was put into effect. And I think one of the things that's maybe a little bit under discussed there is the extent to which it specifically creates strongest\nincentives for American banks to be strong and globally competitive. And that is seems to be the exact opposite of what we want. So that's really one of the ones\nthat needs to get attacked pretty aggressively, I would say.\nChristopher McGratty\nI appreciate all the color. If I could ask kind of a follow-up.

It's obviously a very important question. We look at it very closely. It obviously matters a lot for us as a company. But we\ncontinue to struggle to see signs of weakness. We just -- the consumer basically seems to be fine. Now a few things are true. Like if you look at indicators of\nstress, not surprisingly, you see a little bit more stress in the lower income bands than you see in the higher income bands. But that's always true. That's pretty\nmuch definitionally true. And nothing there is out of line with our expectations. Our delinquency rates are also in line with expectations. You saw that we kept our\nnet charge-off guidance unchanged. So all that looks kind of fine. And to be honest, as we've said before, fundamentally, while there are nuances around the\nedges, consumer credit is primarily about labor markets. And in a world with 4.1% unemployment rate, it's just going to be hard, especially in our portfolio to see a\nlot of weakness. Now it is true that if you look at, not our data, but the government's data, I think I was looking at this the other day, like first half real consumer\nspending of this year versus second half of last year is down. Now it's still positive, it's still growing, but it's down. So it's kind of consistent with the sort of soft\nlanding narrative, which is also consistent with the sort of the GDP outlook that our economists are publishing.

So I think what you're referring to is a slide where Marianne talked about kind of the potential for 6% consumer deposit growth next year. And that's a\nnice number. And as you've written, that would produce some nice revenue consequences, all else being equal. The way I think about that number is to kind of\nbuild it up step by step. So you start with, in general, the consumer deposit base in the system has grown probably slightly above nominal GDP. I think that's been\ntrue for us recently is that as a result of our market position and our pricing choices, we've probably lost a little bit of share during the rate hiking cycle sort of in\nisolation from yield-seeking flows. With the yield-seeking flows having abated a little bit, that relative headwind is kind of behind us, or increasingly behind us. And\nyou've got some core growth reasserting itself. You saw us call out the growth in net new accounts in Consumer checking this quarter, and that's one of the key\ndrivers. And then as you know well, when you look at the franchise, we kind of have: number one, ongoing expansion; number two, seasoning of the old\nexpansion; and number three, deepening in the core markets. So when you put all that together and you look at sort of the history of the growth macro\nenvironment, et cetera, that's how you get to that type of 6% number. Now obviously, things could change quite dramatically to produce a different number,\namong other things. You'll recall that Marianne's slide also talked about a stress scenario with lower rates, which perhaps somewhat non-intuitively would produce\nactually higher growth as a result of even less yield-seeking flow and a higher consumer savings rate. But the flip side of that is also true, which is an\nunexpectedly high rate environment would probably lead to lower balance growth, all else equal in consumer. So we'd like to say, those are all else being equal\ntype numbers, but all else is never equal.\nOperator\nNext, we will go to the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.", "char_count": 2027, "word_count": 357, "token_count": 446, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

That part of the franchise remains fine, but sort of muted as customers have access to capital markets and\nrevolver utilization is sort of flattish in general.

So some of the -- I'm going to give you some things that you can actually do. So I think you should do them and reduce\nrisk in the system. I'm only going to talk about how they increase lending for a second. So G-SIFI inhibits, if you look at it, both a little bit of lending and a little bit\nof market making. LCR inhibits both because it's a very rigid way of looking at the bank balance sheet. It doesn't really give you credit for potential access to\nwindow and things like that. CCAR in some cases inhibits, people -- we talk about CCAR-ness, but there's a lot of CCAR-ness from small business loans and\nstuff like that, where people kind of hold that back a little bit because it creates too much volatility. And CCAR capital, the FSRT, the fundamental book. And when\nyou look at all these things, I think you can create more lending, more liquidity, more flexibility and reduce the risk in the system. And also just CET, just capital\nusage, et cetera. So -- and reducing the risk in the system. I think we also make it friendlier for community banks, which we do want to do. And so if you look at\nlike total loan to deposits, they used to be 100%, they're now 70%, okay? And that's a huge difference that took place over 10 or 15 years.

It's a good question. You may recall, I actually got a version of this question at Investor Day, so I'll more or less repeat my answer here, which is that as we\nknow, fixing SLR has been on the list for a long time. It behaved very much not the way it was designed in the moment of big QE when it became binding and it\nhad bad impacts on the system. It's the opposite of what we want from these backstop measures. And so we don't want regulators to need to make unusual\ncorrections amid crises. It's just not the right way to run the railroad. I think everyone has agreed on that for a long time. And in that context, it's been sort of\ndisappointing that something as obvious as this has taken as long as this to get fixed. But it's a good sign that it's now out there, and we certainly support the\nproposal. There are some nuances that comment have been requested, but at a high level, it's a good proposal. It's the right thing to do. And it's the right thing to\ndo from the perspective of the resilience of the system for the next time that we've got that type of expansion in the size of the system that could make it binding\nin the wrong way for the wrong reasons. But yes, as you noted, and as we've said, we're not really bound by it. I think other actors in the market may be a little bit\nmore bound by it. There are also some nuances about impact on portfolio activity, which I would expect to be very small, versus impact on low-risk intermediation\nin the market-making businesses, which is maybe where you would hope to see the effect. So it's a good thing. Hopefully, it will help. Obviously, it's pretty fully\npriced in at this point.
