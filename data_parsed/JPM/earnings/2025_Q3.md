## Prepared Remarks

### Jamie Dimon (CFO)

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. The presentation is available
on JPMorgan Chase's website. Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please standby. At this time, I would now like to
turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead.

### Jeremy Barnum (Unknown)

Thank you and good morning everyone. Let me begin by noting that this quarter we are experimenting with shorter prepared remarks. We are streamlining this
part of the call to move more quickly to your questions to minimize the amount of time spent on repeating what you have already seen in the earnings materials.
So with that, turning to this quarter's results, the firm reported net income of $14.4 billion and EPS of $5.07 and an ROTCE of 20%. Revenue of $47.1 billion was
up 9% year on year, predominantly driven by higher markets revenue as well as higher fees across asset management, investment banking, and payment. The
increase in NII driven by the impact of balance sheet growth and mix was offset by the impact of lower rates. Expenses of $24.3 billion were up 8% year on year
driven by similar themes as in prior quarters, including higher volume and revenue-related expense. The detailed drivers are in the presentation. And credit costs
were $3.4 billion with net charge-offs of $2.6 billion and a net reserve build of $810 million. In wholesale, charge-offs were slightly elevated as a result of a couple
of instances of apparent fraud in certain secured lending facilities. Otherwise, in both wholesale and consumer, credit performance remains in line with our
expectations. And in terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 14.8%, down 30 basis points versus the prior quarter. You can see the
puts and takes in the presentation. This quarter's higher RWA is primarily driven by increased wholesale lending across both banking and markets as well as
other markets activities. Moving to our businesses, CCB reported net income of $5 billion. Revenue of $19.5 billion was up 9% year on year predominantly driven
by higher NII largely incurred on higher revolving balances. A few points to highlight. Consumers and small businesses remain resilient based on our data. While
we are closely watching the potentially softening labor market, our credit metrics including early-stage delinquencies remain stable and slightly better than
expected. We retained our number one position in retail deposit share in a relatively flat deposit market based on FDIC data, marking our fifth consecutive year of
leading the industry. And in light of the attention our Sapphire refresh has received, we want to note that this has already been the best year ever for new account
acquisitions for our Sapphire portfolio.

Next, the CIB reported net income of $6.9 billion. Revenue of $19.9 billion was up 17% year on year driven by higher revenues across markets, payments,
investment banking, and security. To give a bit more color, IB fees were up 16% year on year reflecting a pickup in activity across products with particular
strength in equity underwriting as the IPO market was active. Our pipeline remains robust and the outlook along with the market backdrop and client sentiment
continues to be upbeat. In markets, fixed income was up 21% year on year with higher revenues in rates and credit as well as strong performance in securitized
products. Equities were up 33%, from robust client activity across the franchise with notable outperformance in Prime. Turning to Asset and Wealth Management,
AWM reported net income of $1.7 billion with a pretax margin of 36%. Record revenue of $6.1 billion was up 12% year on year predominantly driven by growth in
management fees due to long net inflows and higher average market levels as well as higher brokerage activity. Long-term net inflows were $72 billion for the
quarter led by fixed income and equities. AUM of $4.6 trillion was up 18% year on year and client assets of $6.8 trillion up 20% year on year, driven by continued
net inflows and higher market levels. And before turning to the outlook, corporate reported net income of $820 million and revenue of $1.7 billion. In terms of the
outlook, since we have already reported three quarters of results I am going to update the full year guidance in terms of the fourth quarter. And in addition to that,
we have done the implied full year math on the page, you can easily compare it to previous guidance. We expect fourth quarter NII ex markets to be
approximately $23.5 billion and fourth quarter total NII to be about $25 billion. We expect fourth quarter adjusted expense to be approximately $24.5 billion
implying $95.9 billion for the full year with the increase driven by the stronger revenue environment.

And on credit, we now expect the 2025 card net charge-off rates to be approximately 3.3% on favorable delinquency trends driven by the continued resilience of
the consumer. In keeping with our focus on the fourth quarter and recognizing that you will likely annualize the fourth quarter NII and ask us questions about
2026, we are providing the central case for NII ex markets in 2026 which is about $95 billion. Note that this is a preliminary view subject to the usual caveats as
well as the fact that we have not finished the annual budget cycle yet. And for expenses, completing the budget cycle will be even more important is why we are
not providing an update today. While you probably have not spent a lot of time refining your 2026 estimates yet, it is worth saying that when we look at the fourth
quarter and adjust for seasonality, and expected labor inflation as well as adding some growth, the consensus of about $100 billion does look a little bit low. We
will formally provide the 2026 outlook for NII in expense and card MCO rate at fourth quarter earnings and we will have another opportunity to discuss the outlook
at our recently announced company update in February. We are now happy to take your questions, so let us open the line for Q and A.
Operator
Thank you. Please standby. Our first question comes from John McDonald with Truist Securities. You may proceed.
John McDonald
Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for the initial outlook on the 2026 NII. Jeremy, wanted to ask about the retail deposit assumptions that were embedded in that.

## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Glenn Schorr (Evercore)**: Hi, thanks very much. Wanted to drill down a little bit more on credit and you gave us enough I think on the consumer side. You noted the idiosyncratic names on
the broadly syndicated side. So maybe if we could step back and say, you are a big player in obviously everything, broadly syndicated loans, high yield markets
and increasingly on the private debt side. So my question is both of demand and credit fundamentals, What are you seeing in terms of drivers of client demand
there on the lending side? Wholesale front? And then importantly, are you seeing differentiated credit fundamentals across public and private markets? Because
there has been a lot of discussion about that lately and I feel like you are like in the best position to help us.

### Exchange 002

**Glenn Schorr (Evercore)**: Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you.

### Exchange 003

**Betsy Graseck (Morgan Stanley)**: One follow-up on that is on the reserve build, know that you mentioned largely due to card loan growth. Could you give us a sense as to how you are thinking
about the reserve that you have against the commercial book, especially given what you just mentioned? Around the mix of the portfolio is different today than it
was prior cycle? I am thinking prior cycle means pre-COVID, but let me know if it is a different timeframe that you are thinking Well, I mean, think we were thinking
of the entire post-GFC era. I think a couple of Investor Days ago, we put up a slide showing that wholesale charge-off rate over ten years. Might be wrong, but
from memory, was like zero on a net basis, which is obviously not reasonable going forward. But on your narrow question about the reserve, I think you have
actually in that a little bit, I mean, maybe it pop in the consolidated numbers. But in some of the recent quarters, as we have sort of started doing some more of
these direct lending deals, When we put those deals on the books, they come with quite significant day one reserve balances. So in the normal course, that
growth comes with healthy reserves. And hopefully, we get the underwriting right and we got all that money back obviously. So, but as you well know, our entire
wholesale reserve methodology is highly granular and very specific. And so it to the extent that the mix shifts, loan growth will come with slightly higher reserve
and intensity, but that will be situation by situation.

### Exchange 004

**Betsy Graseck (Morgan Stanley)**: Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then just a follow-up is on how you are thinking about your excess capital utilization. I know yesterday you had the press release
on leaning into industries that are critical for U. S. Security, etcetera? And maybe you could speak a little bit to that incremental $500 billion is it that you are
talking about supporting growth of over the next ten years? Relative to the potential for a dividend hike? I mean you could do both obviously. But I did just want to
understand the press release yesterday in that context as well as the opportunity set for a dividend hike? Thanks.

### Exchange 005

**Betsy Graseck (Morgan Stanley)**: Thank you.
Operator
You. Next we will go we will go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. You may proceed.

### Exchange 006

**Ebrahim Poonawala (Bank of America)**: Good morning. I guess maybe Jeremy, a broader question like when we read the quote from Jamie in the press release, customers are resilient, but there is still
massive amounts of uncertainty. I am just wondering if based on what you see both commercial versus consumer, are things getting better as we look into 2026?
Does it feel like we are at a tipping point where we could see a slump in unemployment over the coming months that then leads to concerns around the credit
cycle. Just if there is a bias that you have on how things could play out, that would be helpful color.

### Exchange 007

**Ebrahim Poonawala (Bank of America)**: Got it. And I guess just one follow-up on your comments around expenses. I think there is a lot of discussion among shareholders whether AI and AI-driven
productivity gains mean something for the banks as we look out over the next two to three years. You all have obviously talked about this at the Investor Day. I
am just trying to contextualize when you talk about the expense growth outlook or just sort of preliminary indication for next year. How should bank shareholders
think about AI-led productivity gains in terms of making a dent on the expense growth either next year or for the next few years?

### Exchange 008

**Ebrahim Poonawala (Bank of America)**: Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.

### Exchange 009

**Mike Mayo (Wells Fargo)**: Hi. If I could get an answer to this, from both you Jeremy and Jamie. The question really is how much of a risk is the lending to the NDFIs just because you guys
are always out front highlighting what could happen, whether it is cyber or as you point labor market or inflation. And I feel like you have not really highlighted this
as potential risk area, maybe that is because you do not receive it as such, but you have Tricolor, you have First Brands, one area of your biggest growth I think
has been NDFIs over the last year. So I am just trying to this in some sort of context that it relates to Tricolor who bears the losses? There is it end investors in
the funds? Do you put skin in the game and have your own investments? Are you an underwriter? Where are you exposed I guess I am asking JPMorgan
specifically, but then Jamie more generally for the industry. Is this something that is flashing yellow that we that you are spending more time on? How should we
think about that? Thank you.

### Exchange 010

**Mike Mayo (Wells Fargo)**: And so just a quick short follow-up. After Tricolor. Again, this is a real puny drop in the bucket for you guys, but have you gone back and looked at your processes
and done anything different?

**Jamie Dimon (CFO)**: Yes. I mean, Michael, you should assume that whatever something happens we scour all process, procedures, all underwriting, all everything. And we think we
are okay in other stuff. I my antenna goes up with things like that happen. I probably should not say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably
more. And so we should everyone should be forewarned on this one. And first brands, I would put in the same category, couple of other ones out there I have
seen I put in similar categories. So we always look at these things and we are not omnipotent. We make mistakes too, so we will see. It clearly was, in my
opinion, fraud involved in a bunch of these things. But that does not mean we cannot improve our procedures.

### Exchange 011

**Mike Mayo (Wells Fargo)**: Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And next we will go to the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.

### Exchange 012

**Gerard Cassidy (RBC)**: Hi, Jeremy and Jamie. Jeremy, obviously you guys are in the residential mortgage lending big players granted home lending when you look at the revenue to
banking and wealth management obviously, it is not that big. But I got a question for you. This administration seems to be, when they come out with comments,
they follow-up on those comments with actions. And Secretary of the Treasury, Bessen, has pointed out about a couple of months ago, that he thinks is a housing
emergency in this country. And so the question for you guys is what do you think they could do to lower the spread between mortgage rates and the
corresponding treasury yield assuming the treasury yields do not go down. But what do you what do you think they can actively do to lower that spread to lower
mortgage rates to get housing more active and refinancing activity of course would pick up with that?

**Jamie Dimon (CFO)**: So I will take that one. First on the supply side, I mean it is we know what it is. It is permitting, it is rules, it is local rules, it is how long it takes to get permits and
build not in my backyard, you cannot build two stories in certain places. That is the supply side. The demand side and remember, do not always push
homeownership. That was we made a huge mistake that the government policy years ago. But the supply side, we pointed out over and over and over again. I
have been talking about it for 30 to 40 basis points overall. Would that create any additional risk? There is just excessive stuff put in place after great financial
crisis, which obviously demanded a response, but it is excessive. Anyone who take it on a mortgage will tell you they had to sign 17 forms, 17 documents and all
these things. So that is to me the most obvious one. And obviously, policy, if you the government wants to do more FHA or they could do that. That is up to them
about whether they want cheapen mortgages for near prime or all stuff like that. But if they did have it like that, I would say always do it really thoughtfully.

### Exchange 013

**Gerard Cassidy (RBC)**: Very good. Thank you. And as a follow-up, just speaking about regulators in general, obviously been a major change with this administration. Can you guys give
us any color of what you are actually seeing on the ground? We are what nine months or so into this new administration with the new regulators? And then also
any color on when you think Basel III Endgame may come out and what you are hearing in terms of how it will compare to what the original proposal was in July
2023? Thank you.

### Exchange 014

**Gerard Cassidy (RBC)**: Thank you for the color. I appreciate it.

### Exchange 015

**Erika Najarian (UBS)**: Yes, thank you. My first one is for you, Jeremy. Under the category, no good deed goes unpunished, just wanted to ask a quick question on the expense outlook
for '26. You mentioned that $100 billion could be a little low and that you are in the middle of the planning cycle. That would imply 4% growth year over year. Is
that the sort of new normal labor rate inflation that we should assume at this point?

### Exchange 016

**Erika Najarian (UBS)**: Sure. Someone's job is I will make sure to send this I will make sure you send this transcript to my boss. But the second question is actually for you, Jamie. You
have always had a differentiated way of thinking about risk. And a two-part question for you. Number one, I feel like we do not even know what the right questions
are to ask when it comes to NDFI. Exposure and risk, is such a broad category And so two-part question here. Number one, what would be what would be the
questions you think investors should ask when assessing NDFI exposure as it relates to future credit risk? And second, should investors be concerned about the
SSFA accounting for RWAs in certain structures where you could lower the RWAs to NDFI exposures from 100% to something much lower?

### Exchange 017

**Erika Najarian (UBS)**: Thank you. Thanks, Erica. Thank you.

Operator
Our next question I am have lost Erica. So let us go to the next question. Comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.

**Jamie Dimon (CFO)**: Folks, thank you very much. Spend time with us. We will talk to you all soon. Thank you.
Operator
