{"doc_id": "JPM_TRANSCRIPT_2023_Q4", "ticker": "JPM", "quarter": "Q4", "filing_date": "2023-12-01", "phase": "prepared_remarks", "speaker_name": "Jeremy Barnum", "speaker_role": "unknown", "speaker_firm": null, "utterance_id": "u_0000", "utterance_type": "statement", "text": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back. Starting on Page 1, the firm \nreported net income of $9.3 billion, EPS of $3.04 on revenue of $39.9 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 15%. These results included the $2.9 billion FDIC \nspecial assessment and $743 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. On Page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results. Similar to prior \nquarters, we have called out the impact of First Republic, where relevant. You'll also note that we have now allocated certain deposits, which were previously in \nCCB to the appropriate lines of business. For the quarter, First Republic contributed $1.9 billion of revenue, $890 million of expense, and $647 million of net \nincome. Now, focusing on the firmwide fourth quarter results, excluding First Republic. Revenue of $38.1 billion was up $2.5 billion or 7% year-on-year. NII, \nex-Markets was up $2.2 billion or 11%, predominantly driven by higher rates. NIR, ex-Markets was up $139 million or 1% and Markets revenue was up $141 \nmillion or 2%. Expenses of $23.6 billion were up $4.6 billion or 24% year-on-year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment and higher \ncompensation, including wage inflation and growth in front office and technology. And credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion, and a \nnet reserve build for $474 million. Net charge-offs were up $1.3 billion, predominantly driven by Card and single-name exposures in Wholesale, which were \nlargely previously reserved. The net reserve build was primarily driven by loan growth in Card and the deterioration in the outlook related to commercial \nreal-estate valuations in the Commercial Banking. Looking at the full-year results on Page 3. The firm reported net income of $50 billion, EPS of $16.23, and \nrevenue of $162 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 21%. Onto balance sheet and capital on Page 4. We ended the quarter with CET1 ratio of 15%, up 70 \nbasis points versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, AOCI gains and lower RWA, partially offset by a continued modest pace of capital \ndistributions as the firm builds towards the proposed Basel III Endgame requirements. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 5. Total debit \nand credit card spend was up 7% year-on-year, driven by strong account growth and consumer spend remained stable. Turning now to the financial results, \nexcluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $17 billion, which was up 8% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, \nrevenue was up 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher NII on higher rates, largely offset by lower deposits, with average balances down 8% year-on-year. Client \ninvestment assets were up 25%, driven by market performance and strong net inflows. In fact, it's been a record year for retail net new money. In Home Lending \nrevenue was up $230 million, predominantly driven by the absence of an MSR loss this quarter versus the prior year and higher NII. Moving to Card Services & \nAuto, revenue was up 8% year-on-year, driven by higher card services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Card \noutstandings were up 14% due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve. And in auto, originations were $9.9 billion, up 32% as we \ngained market share while retaining strong margins. Expenses of $8.7 billion were up 10% year-on-year, largely driven by compensation, including an increase in \nemployees, primarily in bankers, advisors, and technology, and wage inflation, as well as continued investments in marketing and technology. In terms of credit \nperformance this quarter, credit costs were $2.2 billion, largely driven by net charge-offs which were up $791 million year-on-year, predominantly due to continued \nnormalization in card. The net reserve build of $538 million reflected loan growth in card. Next, the CIB on Page 6. The CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on \nrevenue of $11 billion. Investment banking revenue of $1.6 billion was up 13% year-on-year. IB fees were also up 13% year-on-year and we ended the year \nranked number one with a wallet share of 8.8%. And advisory fees were up 2%. Underwriting fees were up significantly compared to a weak prior year quarter \nwith debt up 21% and equity up 30%. We are starting the year with a healthy pipeline and we are encouraged by the level of capital markets activity, but \nannounced M&A remains a headwind, and the extent as well as the timing of capital markets normalization remains uncertain. Payments revenue was $2.3 \nbillion, up 10% year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was flat as fee growth was predominantly offset by deposit-related client credits. Moving to Markets, \ntotal revenue was $5.8 billion, up 2% year-on-year. Fixed income was a record fourth quarter, up 8%. It was another strong quarter in our securitized products \nbusiness, which was partially offset by lower revenue and rates coming off a strong quarter last year. Equity markets was down 8%, driven by lower revenue in \nderivatives and cash. Security services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 3% year-on-year. Expenses of $6.8 billion were up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven \nby the timing of revenue-related compensation. Credit costs were $210 million, reflecting net charge-offs of $121 million and a net reserve build of $89 million. \nMoving to the Commercial Bank on Page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 7% year-on-year, largely \ndriven by higher NII, where the impact of rates was partially offset by lower deposit balances. Payments revenue of $2 billion was up 2% year-on-year driven by \nfee growth, largely offset by deposit-related client credits. Gross investment banking and markets revenue of $924 million was up 32% year-on-year, primarily \nreflecting increased capital markets and M&A activity. Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 9% year-on-year, driven by an increase in employees, including front \noffice and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 6% \nyear-on-year, primarily driven by lower non-operating deposits as clients continue to opt for higher-yielding alternatives and flat quarter-on-quarter as client \nbalances are seasonally higher at year-end. Loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter. C&I loans were down 2%, reflecting lower revolver utilization and muted \ndemand for new loans as clients remained cautious. And CRE loans were flat as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payoff activity. \nFinally, credit costs were $269 million, including net charge-offs of $127 million and a net reserve build of $142 million, driven by deterioration in our commercial \nreal estate valuation outlook. And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $925 million with \npretax margin of 28%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was up 2% year-on-year, driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market \nlevels, predominantly offset by lower NII. The decrease in NII reflects lower deposit margins and balances partially offset by wider spreads on loans. Expenses of \n$3.4 billion were up 11% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including performance-based incentives, continued growth in our private banking \nadvisor teams, the impact of closing JPMorgan Asset Management China acquisition, and the continued investment in global shares. For the quarter, net \nlong-term inflows were $12 billion, positive across equities and fixed income, and $140 billion for the full year. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $49 billion for the \nquarter and net inflows of $242 billion for the full year. And we had record client asset net inflows of $489 billion for the year. AUM of $3.4 trillion and client assets \nof $5 trillion were both up 24% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter and \ndeposits were up 7% quarter-on-quarter. Turning to Corporate on Page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $689 million. Revenue of $1.8 billion was up $597 \nmillion year-on-year. NII of $2.5 billion was up $1.2 billion year-on-year due to the impact of higher rates and balance sheet mix. NIR was a net loss of $687 \nmillion compared to the net loss of $115 million, and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. And expenses of $3.4 billion were up $3 \nbillion year-on-year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment. With that, let's pivot to the outlook for 2024, starting with NII on Page 10. We expect\n\n2024 NII ex-Markets to be approximately $88 billion. Going through the drivers, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve, which currently includes\nsix cuts this year. On deposits, we expect balances to be very modestly down from current levels. While lower rates should decrease repricing pressure, we\nremain asset sensitive, and therefore the lower rates will decrease NII, resulting in more normal deposit margins. We expect strong loan growth in Card to\ncontinue, but not at the same pace as 2023. Still, this should help offset some of the impact of lower rates. Outside of Card, loan growth will likely remain muted.\nIt's important to note that we just reported a quarterly NII ex-Markets run rate of $94 billion. Combining that with the full-year guidance of approximately $88 billion\nimplies meaningful sequential quarterly declines throughout 2024, consistent with what we've been telling you for some time. And keep in mind that many of the\nsources of uncertainty that we've highlighted previously surrounding the NII outlook remain. And on total NII, we expect it to be approximately $90 billion for the\nfull-year, reflecting an increase in Markets NII which, as always, you should think of as largely offset in NIR. Now, let's turn to expenses on Page 11. We expect\n2024 adjusted expense to be about $90 billion. You'll see on the slide we provided detail by line of business. Generally, you can see that both in dollar terms and\nin percentage terms, the expense growth is aligned to where the greatest opportunities are, both in terms of share and available returns. And of course, you'll\nhear more at Investor Day and between now and then. On the right-hand side of the page, we've highlighted some firmwide drivers. Thematically, the biggest\ndriver is what I might call business growth writ large. Within that, narrowly defined volume and revenue-related growth represents about $1 billion of the increase\nacross the company as a result of an improved NIR outlook, compared to about $400 million in 2023. But in addition, the ongoing growth of the company, which\ncontinues to produce share gains and additional profitability, is coming with increased expense across a range of categories. The quantum of investment increase\nis comparable to last year's increase and is driven by all the same themes, bankers, branches, advisors, technology as well as marketing. Net-net, First Republic\nproduces a modest increase in expenses, but with a significantly lower 2024 exit run rate as the result of business integration efforts. Finally, despite significantly\nlower inflation outlook in the economy as a whole, we still see some residual effects of inflation flowing through most of our expense categories. It's worth noting\nthat both the general business growth and investment growth include decisions that have been executed both in response to market conditions during 2023 and\nto support the future growth and profitability of the company. We've included the fourth quarter 2023 exit rate on the page to illustrate that a significant portion of\nthe year-on-year increase in expense is already in the run rate. Now, let's turn to Page 12 and cover credit and wrap up. On credit, we continue to expect the\n2024 card net charge-off rate to be below 3.5%, consistent with Investor Day guidance. So in closing, we shouldn't leave 2023 without noting what an outstanding\nyear it was, producing record revenue and net income despite some notable significant items. We're very proud of what we accomplished this year and want to\nthank everyone who made it possible. At the same time, we emphasized throughout 2023 the extent to which we were over-earning, as indicated by an ROTCE\nthat is 4% above our through-the-cycle target. As we turn to 2024, it shouldn't be surprising that our outlook has us beginning to march down the path towards\nnormalization of our returns. But despite the expected dissipation of the 2023 tailwinds and the presence of significant economic and geopolitical uncertainties, we\nremain optimistic about this franchise's ability to produce superior returns through a broad range of environments. And this management team remains\nlaser-focused on executing for shareholders, clients, and communities. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] For our first question, it's coming from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nMatt O'Connor\nGood morning. Thanks for all the comments on the net interest income. Any updates on that medium-term outlook that you've put out there?", "char_count": 13467, "word_count": 2156, "token_count": 2989, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "JPM_TRANSCRIPT_2023_Q4_u_0000", "company": "JPM", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2023, "period": "2023-Q4", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/JPM/JPM_FY2023_Q4.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

I think you're referring to that $80 billion number that we put out there. And I wouldn't exactly describe that as an outlook. I\nthink it's more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the over-earning. So not particularly necessary to revise the number.\nBut I just would point out again, as we highlighted on the page and as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, that when you look at that $94 billion exit rate and\nfull-year guidance of $88 billion, that implies obviously exiting below $88 billion and some significant sequential decline. So in that sense, you can see us kind of\nmarching on the path to that $80 billion. Whether we ever get to the $80 billion or not and when is maybe a topic for later in the year or next year.\nMatt O'Connor\nOkay. And then just separately, you bought back a couple of billion dollars of stock this quarter. What's your thought process on buybacks, given the strong\ncapital generation, but also some uncertainty on regulatory proposals?", "char_count": 1055, "word_count": 188, "token_count": 229, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "JPM_TRANSCRIPT_2023_Q4_u_0001", "company": "JPM", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2023, "period": "2023-Q4", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/JPM/JPM_FY2023_Q4.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

I think you framed it exactly correctly in the sense that we obviously have a lot of buyback capacity in general based on organic capital\ngeneration. So the normal capital hierarchy will apply. But for now, we plan to remain on a modest base of buybacks consistent with that kind of $2 billion net\nbuyback, a quarter number that we've talked about and that you've seen us do in light of probably the need to continue building to have a bit of a buffer, as you\nsaid, the uncertainty about the finalization of the rules. And also, just as a reminder, the SCB is probably a little bit low right now and has been quite volatile. So\nthat's another factor that we need to keep in mind.\nMatt O'Connor\nOkay.

You may proceed.\nJohn McDonald\n\nThanks. Jeremy, could you give a little more color on what's baked into the loan loss reserve in terms of kind of weighted average assumptions and how any\nchange in macro outlook played into the dynamics of the reserve builds and releases this quarter?", "char_count": 377, "word_count": 64, "token_count": 77, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "JPM_TRANSCRIPT_2023_Q4_u_0003", "company": "JPM", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2023, "period": "2023-Q4", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/JPM/JPM_FY2023_Q4.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

Actually, John, this quarter, that's all like pretty quiet. So the weighted average unemployment rate in the numbers still 5.5%. We didn't have any really big\nrevisions in the macro outlook driving the numbers. And our skew remains, as it has been a little bit skewed to the downside, just recognizing that we still see\nrisks being elevated, which obviously you can see that skew, and the difference between the weighted average unemployment of 5.5% and what's in our central\noutlook, which I think is something like 4.6% peak of the current levels.\nJohn McDonald\nOkay. And then just to follow up on the NII, could you give us some sensitivity to that outlook when you flex the amount of Fed cuts, what's the impact of a few\nFed cuts, and how much does it matter for the first two versus if you're thinking four, five, six?

Yes. Happy to do that, John. So I think probably the best way to do this is to look at our EAR numbers. So, as you know, we don't update that until the Q,\nbut on an estimated basis, it's going to be a little bit lower, I think something like $1.9 billion as opposed to $2.1 billion. So just round numbers, about $2 billion in\nEAR. I think empirically the number is maybe a little higher than that, just because even though we do model lags in the EAR, we've been seeing the lag effect be\na little bit bigger, but just crudely, I think, as I noted, we do remain asset-sensitive. That's one way to quantify it. I would say the empirical number would maybe\nbe a little higher than that, and hopefully, that gives you enough to work with.\nJohn McDonald\nOkay. Thanks.\nOperator\nNext, we'll go to the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities.

Maybe just a follow-up in a different way on the NII question. Just in deposits, can you, Jeremy, discuss your assumptions on the reprice and\nmigration thoughts?

So let's do reprice first. So I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit\nof pressure off the reprice, especially product level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal migration, particularly out of checking and savings\ninto CDs, and in wholesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing. And that trajectory I would expect to continue even in\na lower rate environment. So as a result, if you look at weighted average rate paid, for example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that\nnumber to be a little bit higher, just even in a world with six cuts. And that's actually intuitive when you think about it as people continue migrating into CDs. But\nmaybe a little non-intuitive, if you're kind of trying to do beta-type math with change in rates and change in rate pay, it gets a little bit non-intuitive. And then in\nterms of balances. Yes, you'll note that I said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down, which when you consider that QT, despite the various\nspeculations about having it slow down later in the year, continues, and that long growth in the system as a whole is expected to be quite muted. It's a pretty\nmodest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates. So I kind of agree with you that this environment is, at the margin, a little bit more supportive for\nsystem-wide deposit balances.

So whether you believe it or not is a separate \nissue. But I think that is the consensus. In terms of consumer resilience, I made some comments about this on the press call. The way we see it, the consumer is \nfine. All of the relevant metrics are now effectively normalized. And the question really, in light of the fact that cash buffers are now also normal, but that that\n\nmeans that consumers have been spending more than they're taking in, is how that spending behavior adjusts as we go into the new year in a world where their\ncash buffers are less comfortable than they were. So one can speculate about different trajectories that that could take.

And - yes, and of course, you will, as I noted, be hearing more from us at Investor Day and between now and Investor Day. \nBut I will take a little bit of extra time here to answer your question, because you're right, it's important to give you the transparency. And I'm going to follow the \nstructure that we used on the page and go through each line of business. So starting with CCB, it's the biggest dollar driver overall. It's an 8% increase\n\nyear-on-year, which is about the same as we had last year. One key driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that. In 2023, we built 166 new\nbranches and we're planning about a similar number this year. Marketing is also a driver. We're seeing great opportunities, great demand and engagement in our\ncard products and so that shows up in marketing. And as you well know, our wealth strategy and CCB remains a big focus and priority. I think it's worth noting\nhere, right, that as we've talked about and as you know Mike, some of our investments are designed to produce short-term payoffs and some of them are much\nlonger-term and some of them are just table stakes. But we actually see quite a bit of evidence of current payoffs in our current results in the CCB investment. So\nfor example, in 2023, we had 2 million net new checking accounts, we had an 8% growth in active card accounts, and over the last three years, we've increased\ndeposit market share by 180 basis points. So as we've often said about the company as a whole, we're very happy to be producing very good current returns and\ngrowth while investing for the future. In AWM, continued client advisor hiring is a key driver, as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new\nclients have the support that they need. And a little bit to the prior question, in AWM we also have a little bit of volume and revenue-related driver tied to an\nimproved revenue outlook. The Commercial Bank is an interesting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of ads that we did in the middle of\nthe year based on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire ecosystem, as well\nas the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our long-standing and pre-existing innovation economy strategy. So we took\nsome opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise. And then as you look into 2024, it's really pretty consistent themes for the ones\nthat we had before, including hiring bankers both domestically and internationally. The CIB story is a little bit different. The percentage growth there is lower,\nwhich recognizes, I think, both our very, very strong share positions as a starting point and also the fact that we've been investing quite aggressively for some\ntime in the payments business, which has produced meaningful payoffs already there in terms of significant share gains. So as a result, the biggest driver in the\nCIB is really generic inflation, including labor, as well as, again, to the prior question, volume and revenue-related increases tied to the improved NIR outlook. And\nI do want to say for the avoidance of doubt, that despite all of this, our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness and\nmaking sure that we're upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely the best talent in the CIB remains fully in effect. Finally, you'll note that I haven't actually\ntalked about technology in any of the businesses. And that's actually because even though all of the businesses in various ways are investing in technology and\nspending money on it, the drivers are actually very consistent across the entire firm, even though it's very bottoms-up driven. And those drivers are consistent\nwith what they've been, new products, features, and customer platforms, as well as modernization. So that's happening throughout the company, both at the app\nlevel and otherwise. And I will say, actually, in closing, talking about technology, which I think is interesting, that to the point about a driver being growth writ large,\none of the things that we see is higher volume-related technology expense throughout the company. So thanks for the question, Mike. It was a good opportunity\nto give you guys a bit more color here.", "char_count": 4401, "word_count": 771, "token_count": 945, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "JPM_TRANSCRIPT_2023_Q4_u_0020", "company": "JPM", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2023, "period": "2023-Q4", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/JPM/JPM_FY2023_Q4.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

Having said that, let me just react to a couple of things that you said. So again, I don't want to get into like micro validation one way or\nthe other of some of your back-of-the-envelope math, but we did have some accelerated pull to par on some of the accretion of some of the loans that we\npurchased this year. So I think the annualization that you're doing is maybe a bit high for the 2024 number. And then from a sensitivities perspective, I actually\nthink I can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the EAR for my response to the prior question, because that EAR fully includes all of\nthe First Republic assets and liabilities with all of their various dynamics. And so I think that's kind of like an easier way to think about it for the company.", "char_count": 1296, "word_count": 239, "token_count": 281, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "JPM_TRANSCRIPT_2023_Q4_u_0046", "company": "JPM", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2023, "period": "2023-Q4", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/JPM/JPM_FY2023_Q4.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

I mean, I can probably answer that question if I think about it for a second, but it sort of violates my prior statement that I really don't want to get into the\nbusiness of guiding on First Republic. If I do the big picture, right, so big picture, 2023, we had eight months of First Republic NII. 2024, we're going to have 12.\nSo all else equal, there's calendarization in there. What's also true is that in 2023, as a result of the impact of the NII of the pull to par of certain relatively\nshort-dated assets that we fair valued at a meaningful discount as part of the transaction, that sort of - that pulled to par happens quite quickly and therefore\nprobably juice the 2023 number a little bit.
