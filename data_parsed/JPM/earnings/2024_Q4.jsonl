{"doc_id": "JPM_2024_Q4", "ticker": "JPM", "year": 2024, "quarter": 4, "filing_date": "2024-12-01", "phase": "prepared_remarks", "speaker_name": "Jeremy Barnum", "speaker_role": "Unknown", "speaker_firm": null, "utterance_id": "u_0000", "utterance_type": "statement", "text": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $14 billion, EPS of $4.81 on revenue of $43.7 billion with an ROTCE \nof 21%. On Page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results. The firm reported revenue of $43.7 billion, up $3.8 billion or 10% year-on-year. NII ex-markets \nwas down $548 million or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and the associated deposit margin compression as well as lower deposit balances in CCB, \nlargely offset by the impact of securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in card and higher wholesale deposit balances. NII ex-markets was up $3.1 \nbillion or 30%. Excluding the prior year's net investment securities losses, it was up 21%, largely on higher asset management fees and investment banking fees. \nAnd markets revenue was up $1.2 billion or 21%. Expenses of $22.8 billion were down $1.7 billion or 7% year-on-year. Excluding the prior year's FDIC special \nassessment, expenses were up $1.2 billion or 5%, predominantly driven by compensation as well as higher brokerage and distribution fees. And credit costs were \n$2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.4 billion and a net reserve of $267 million. On Page 3, you can see the reported results for the full year, I'll remind you \nthat there were a number of significant items in 2024. Excluding those items, the firm reported net income of $54 billion, EPS of $18.22, revenue of $173 billion \nand we delivered an ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights for the year, in CCB, we had a record number of first-time investors and acquired nearly \n10 million new card accounts. In CIB, we had record revenue in markets, payments, and security services, and in AWM, we had record long-term net inflows of \n$234 billion, positive across all channels, regions, and asset classes. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 4, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of \n15.7%, up 40 basis points versus the prior quarter as net income and lower RWA were largely offset by both OCI losses and capital distributions, which included \n$4 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter. The $24 billion decrease in RWA reflects a seasonal decline in markets activity and lower wholesale \nlending, which was predominantly offset by a seasonal increase in card. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 5. CCB reported net income \nof $4.5 billion on revenue of $18.4 billion, which was up 1% year-on-year. In Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was down 7% year-on-year on deposit \nmargin compression and lower deposits, partially offset by growth in wealth management revenue. Average deposits were down 4% year-on-year and flat \nsequentially as consumer balances have stabilized. Client investment assets were up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we \ncontinue to see healthy flows across branch and digital channels. In Home Lending, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher \nproduction revenue. Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances. Card \noutstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and revolver growth. And in Auto, originations were $10.6 billion, up 7%, reflecting higher lease \nvolume on robust new vehicle inventory. Expenses of $9.7 billion were up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by field compensation and growth in \ntechnology. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion, up $428 million year-on-year, driven \nby Card. The net reserve build was $557 million, predominantly driven by higher Card revolving balances. Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on Page 6. \nCIB reported net income of $6.6 billion on revenue of $17.6 billion. IV fees were up 49% year-on-year and we ranked number one with wallet share of 9.3% for \n2024. Advisory fees were up 41%, benefiting from large deals and share growth in a number of key sectors. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up \n56% and equity up 54%, primarily driven by favorable market conditions. In terms of the outlook for the overall investment banking wallet, in light of the positive \nmomentum, we remain optimistic about our pipeline. Payments revenue was $4.7 billion, up 3% year-on-year, excluding equity investments, driven by higher \ndeposit balances and fee growth, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was $1.9 billion, up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven by \nlower losses on hedges. Moving to markets, total revenue was $7 billion, up 21% year-on-year. Fixed income was up 20% with better performance in credit as \nwell as continued outperformance in currencies and emerging markets. Equities was up 22% on elevated client activity and derivatives amid increased volatility \nand higher trading volumes and cash. Security Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 10% year-on-year, driven by fee growth on higher client activity and market \nlevels as well as higher deposit balances. Expenses of $8.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher brokerage, technology, and legal \nexpense. Average banking and payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially. Global Corporate & Investment Banking loans were \ndown 2% quarter-on-quarter, driven by paydowns in lower short-term financing, primarily offset by new originations. In commercial banking, middle market loans \nwere also down 2%, driven by paydowns, predominantly offset by new originations, and commercial real estate loans were flat as new originations were offset by \npaydowns. Average client deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 5% sequentially, driven by underlying client growth. Finally, credit costs were $61 million, driven \nby net downgrade activity and the net impact of charge-offs, offset -- largely offset by a reserve release due to an update to certain loss assumptions. Then to \ncomplete our lines of business, Asset & Wealth Management on Page 7. AWM reported net income of $1.5 billion with pre-tax margin of 35%. Revenue of $5.8 \nbillion was up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows as well as higher \nperformance fees. Expenses of $3.8 billion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation \nand continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $76 billion for the quarter, positive \nacross all asset classes. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $94 billion for the quarter and $104 billion for the full year -- $140 billion for the full year, sorry. And we \nhad client asset net inflows of $468 billion for the year. AUM of $4 trillion and client assets of $5.9 trillion were both up 18% year-on-year, driven by continued net \ninflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were up 5% quarter-on-quarter. Turning to Corporate on Page 8; \nCorporate reported net income of $1.3 billion. Revenue of $2 billion was up $223 million year-on-year. NII of $2 billion was down $415 million year-on-year, driven \nby the impact of lower rates, largely offset by balance sheet actions, primarily securities reinvestment activity. NII was a net loss of $30 million compared to the \nnet loss of $668 million in the prior year, driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter. And expenses of $550 million were down $3 billion \nyear-on-year, predominantly driven by the absence of the FDIC Special Assessment of $2.9 billion in the prior year. With that, let's pivot to the outlook, starting \nwith NII on Page 9. We expect 2025 NII ex-markets to be approximately $90 billion. Going through the drivers, as usual, the outlook assumes that rates follow the \nforward curve. It's worth noting that the NII decrease is driven by both the cut expected in 2025 and the impact of the 100 basis points of cuts in the back half of \n2024. You can see on the page that we've illustrated the historical trajectory of card loan growth. We expect healthy card loan growth again this year, but below \nthe 12% pace we saw in 2024 as tailwinds from revolve normalization are largely behind us. Turning to deposits; firm-wide deposits have stabilized and we \nexpect to see a more visible growth trend to assert itself in the second half of 2025. It's notable that we can already see that trend in consumer checking deposits. \nOn deposit margin, we expect modest compression due to lower rates. When you put all that together, we expect the NII trough could be sometime in the middle\n\nof the year, followed by growth as we illustrated at the bottom of the bar. And for completeness, we expect firm-wide NII to be approximately $94 billion as a\nfunction of markets NII increasing to about $4 billion, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR. Finally, I want to point out that starting this quarter,\nwe are including an estimate of earnings at risk in the earnings supplement, so you no longer have to wait for the K or the Q to get that number. Now let's turn to\nexpenses on Page 10. We expect 2025 expense to be about $95 billion. Looking at the chart in the middle of the page, I'll touch on the drivers of the year-on-year\nchange, which you'll note are very consistent with what you've been hearing from us recently. The largest increase is volume and revenue-related expense, which\nis primarily driven by expected growth in auto leasing as well as capital markets. As a reminder, this comes with higher revenues. We continue to hire bankers\nand advisors to support business growth as well as expand our branch network. The increase in tech spend is primarily business-driven as we continue to invest\nin new products, features, and customer platforms as well as modernization. Marketing remains a driver of spend as we continue to see attractive opportunities,\nresulting in strong demand and engagement in our Card business. And finally, while we haven't explicitly called it out in each bar, inflation remains a source of\nsome upward pressure, and as always, we are generating efficiencies to help offset it. Now let's turn to Page 11 to cover credit and wrap-up. On credit, we expect\nthe 2025 card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 3.6%. So, in closing, 2024 was another year of record revenue and net\nincome, and we're proud of what we accomplished. As we look ahead to 2025, we still expect NII normalization, although to a lesser extent than we previously\nthought. And taking a step back, we think it's important to acknowledge the tension in the risks and uncertainties in the environment and the degree of optimism\nembedded in asset prices and expectations. In that context, we remain upbeat about the strength of the franchise, but we are focused on being prepared for a\nwide range of scenarios. Finally, let me say a few words about the wildfires in Los Angeles, while we don't expect much of a financial impact from it, we have a\npresence in the area across all three lines of business, so we're keeping in close contact with our customers, clients, and employees. We are offering support in a\nvariety of ways, including waiving consumer and business banking fees as well as making a contribution to local relief organizations, offering employee donation\nmatching, and supporting employee volunteer efforts. With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie before we open up the line for Q&A.", "char_count": 11632, "word_count": 1905, "token_count": 2609, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we feel very\ncomfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We believe there's a good chance\nthat there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current opportunities would suggest. And so that feels\nlike a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it quite extensively over the last six months and had all the debates\nthat you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough, we have enough excess. And given that we would like to not have the excess grow from here.\nSo when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we find in the\nnear-term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal in order to arrest the growth of\nthe excess, and that is our current plan, although I'll give you the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which is we don't want to get in the business of\nguiding on buybacks and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but that is our current thinking.\nJohn McDonald\nOkay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year. How does it differ from, say, last year or last\ncouple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about? And then what kind of efficiencies are baked into the\noutlook as well? Thanks.", "char_count": 1776, "word_count": 321, "token_count": 380, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}
{"doc_id": "JPM_2024_Q4", "ticker": "JPM", "year": 2024, "quarter": 4, "filing_date": "2024-12-01", "phase": "qa", "speaker_name": "Jeremy Barnum", "speaker_role": "Unknown", "speaker_firm": null, "utterance_id": "u_0006", "utterance_type": "statement", "text": "Sure. I mean, the truth is, and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So we are seeing the results of our kind of high-certainty\ninvestment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses and those continue to be the main\nareas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities, in the Commercial & Investment Bank, we continue drilling down\nand analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a level or two below the very significant -- significantly strong share positions that\nyou see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the ambers that are behind the greens and that's embedded in the culture of the\ncompany. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and iterating and we throw resources against that stuff, as we do that. But broadly, the themes were\nvery consistent. I think in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we've generated at\nthis company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen, it happens every day in all the teams everywhere. And so that is sort of part of the bottoms-up culture and that\nremains the case. We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, technology for starters, we're putting a lot of effort into improving the sort\nof ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development and there's been a lot of focus on the development environment for them in order to\nenable them to be more productive, and so all else equal, that generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of efficient -- a lot of focus on the efficiency of\nour hardware utilization and so that's embedded in there as well. And another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that at Investor Day, I talked about how we\nhad probably reached peak modernization spend. Now as Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So the fact that we've gotten to a peak and that it might\ncome down a little bit from here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of\ncapacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency. Finally, though, what I\nwould say is that, if you look at the headcount trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot and it's been for very good reasons and it\nhas contributed quite a bit to our growth and our ability to run the company efficiently, but anytime you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate\nof headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so this year, as we went through the budget\ncycle, we asked people at the margin to try to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So, we're going to try to\nrun things, with some important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat headcount and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as\nthey get creative with their teams and reconsider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high-certainty investment\nand growth. So obviously branches and bankers and so on, and also critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like cyber or whatever independent risk\nmanagement needs to ensure that we're running the company safely. So that's how we're thinking about efficiency in the current moment.\nJohn McDonald\nVery helpful. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you.

So backing\noff a second, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a company for a long time, which is that all we want is a\ncoherent, rational, holistically assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do their job supporting the economy that isn't reflexively anti-bank. It doesn't\ndefault to the answer to every question being more of everything, more capital, more liquidity. It uses data and it balances the obvious goal that we all share of a\nsafe and sound banking system with actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth. And the hope is that we got some of that and that\nalso while we're at it, some aspects of the supervisory framework get a little bit less bureaucratic and a little bit less adversarial and a little bit more substantive so\nthat at the margin, management can focus its time on the things that matter the most. So, whether capital goes up, down, stays flat is really so complicated\nbecause it's not just Basel III endgame, it's also G-SIB, it's also a number of other factors and that's why we keep hammering away on the importance of doing all\nof this holistically, properly with the right analysis.

So\nif we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So\nobviously, from what we understand, if you print that somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your G-SIB surcharge goes up by -- to 5% or by 50\nbasis points two years and one day from now. At the same time, around the holidays, we did get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit\nfrom the banks. In terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test.\nSo as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So as we think about your returns going forward,\nthe definition of excess also continues to shift. So how should we think about those cross currents in terms of two big components, clearly one is your G-SIB\nsurcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer?", "char_count": 1173, "word_count": 220, "token_count": 270, "exchange_id": "ex_005", "exchange_role": "question"}

Okay you are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. So let's try to address this not at too much great length. First of all, G-SIB; so \nyes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter or fourth quarter. So while our current view of the G-SIB number is an\n\nestimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in\nterms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures in various types. So that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms\nof our typical seasonal pattern. So not much to see there. And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a\nlittle bit hung up, with the smaller buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other,\nbut anyway, for now, we're managing to the current rules and normal seasonality took us back under five. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only thing\nto say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking about for a long time in\nterms of transparency and volatility and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR process needs improvement. So that's great.\nI think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me if you just read what they said publicly in their press releases, this is\nas much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute limitations deadlines that were coming up. So let's just hope that we see some significant\nprogress on that front. And then taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is what is our core view about -- and I think probably the best way\nto think about this is just through the lens of the numerator actually. What is our core view about -- if you just for the sake of argument assume modest growth in\nthe normalized amount of economic denominator like actual need for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a\nfunction of the environment. And the way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analyses of like a flat numerator, up 5 numerator,\nup 10 numerator, up 20 numerator, I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator is a little less. And then guessing about our several\ncase and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And as you point out, at 15.7 and I think the actual quantum of the\nnumerator is something like $275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow\nanymore.", "char_count": 2941, "word_count": 531, "token_count": 634, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

And, you could draw the conclusion that means that the\nover-earning narrative is no longer applicable. I think if you take a big step back by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the\nweighted-average rate paid on consumer deposits remains quite elevated. For a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is\nalways going to be a response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that for the time\nbeing, anyway, when we do the math, that's what we see.

Yes, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of, frankly, that would be in\nthat category certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance would be acquisition finance, because that's been relatively muted as a\nfunction of the M&A environment. And if that picks up, you could see more there. Now those aren't loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that\nlong. So, whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever is a separate issue, but as we -- as you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you\nknow that card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current\nguess about the future, it will be -- it's decelerating a little bit rather than the opposite, still growing above-trend obviously, which is great and it's a sign of the\nstrength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're getting from our card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well\nthe state of the mortgage market given rates, rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So yes, I think\na higher growth environment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in business banking, could you see a bit more growth in C&I at the\nmargin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more on the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So we'll see. We'll see what happens\nthere. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the greens, I think you know them, right, and they're aligned with our big longstanding investment\nstrategies. The biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the wealth management space, we are significantly\nunderpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we bring to the table. So\nthat's why we're pushing so hard on that front because I think we can get more share there and it completes the franchise very nicely.
