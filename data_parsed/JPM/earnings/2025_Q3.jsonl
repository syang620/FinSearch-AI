Let me begin by noting that this quarter we are experimenting with shorter prepared remarks. We are streamlining this\npart of the call to move more quickly to your questions to minimize the amount of time spent on repeating what you have already seen in the earnings materials.\nSo with that, turning to this quarter's results, the firm reported net income of $14.4 billion and EPS of $5.07 and an ROTCE of 20%. Revenue of $47.1 billion was\nup 9% year on year, predominantly driven by higher markets revenue as well as higher fees across asset management, investment banking, and payment. The\nincrease in NII driven by the impact of balance sheet growth and mix was offset by the impact of lower rates. Expenses of $24.3 billion were up 8% year on year\ndriven by similar themes as in prior quarters, including higher volume and revenue-related expense. The detailed drivers are in the presentation. And credit costs\nwere $3.4 billion with net charge-offs of $2.6 billion and a net reserve build of $810 million. In wholesale, charge-offs were slightly elevated as a result of a couple\nof instances of apparent fraud in certain secured lending facilities. Otherwise, in both wholesale and consumer, credit performance remains in line with our\nexpectations. And in terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 14.8%, down 30 basis points versus the prior quarter. You can see the\nputs and takes in the presentation. This quarter's higher RWA is primarily driven by increased wholesale lending across both banking and markets as well as\nother markets activities. Moving to our businesses, CCB reported net income of $5 billion. Revenue of $19.5 billion was up 9% year on year predominantly driven\nby higher NII largely incurred on higher revolving balances. A few points to highlight. Consumers and small businesses remain resilient based on our data. While\nwe are closely watching the potentially softening labor market, our credit metrics including early-stage delinquencies remain stable and slightly better than\nexpected. We retained our number one position in retail deposit share in a relatively flat deposit market based on FDIC data, marking our fifth consecutive year of\nleading the industry. And in light of the attention our Sapphire refresh has received, we want to note that this has already been the best year ever for new account\nacquisitions for our Sapphire portfolio.", "char_count": 2443, "word_count": 404, "token_count": 508, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

Revenue of $19.9 billion was up 17% year on year driven by higher revenues across markets, payments,\ninvestment banking, and security. To give a bit more color, IB fees were up 16% year on year reflecting a pickup in activity across products with particular\nstrength in equity underwriting as the IPO market was active. Our pipeline remains robust and the outlook along with the market backdrop and client sentiment\ncontinues to be upbeat. In markets, fixed income was up 21% year on year with higher revenues in rates and credit as well as strong performance in securitized\nproducts. Equities were up 33%, from robust client activity across the franchise with notable outperformance in Prime. Turning to Asset and Wealth Management,\nAWM reported net income of $1.7 billion with a pretax margin of 36%. Record revenue of $6.1 billion was up 12% year on year predominantly driven by growth in\nmanagement fees due to long net inflows and higher average market levels as well as higher brokerage activity. Long-term net inflows were $72 billion for the\nquarter led by fixed income and equities. AUM of $4.6 trillion was up 18% year on year and client assets of $6.8 trillion up 20% year on year, driven by continued\nnet inflows and higher market levels. And before turning to the outlook, corporate reported net income of $820 million and revenue of $1.7 billion. In terms of the\noutlook, since we have already reported three quarters of results I am going to update the full year guidance in terms of the fourth quarter. And in addition to that,\nwe have done the implied full year math on the page, you can easily compare it to previous guidance. We expect fourth quarter NII ex markets to be\napproximately $23.5 billion and fourth quarter total NII to be about $25 billion.

Thanks for that. So yes, you are referring specifically to a page that was presented at Investor Day by Marianne for the CCB. With\nsome illustrative scenarios for what we might expect CCB deposit growth to do as a function of some different potential macroeconomic scenarios. And in the kind\nof then prevailing central case scenario, if you say we had 3% growth in the fourth quarter of this year, and 6% projected for 2026. So as we sit here right now\nand we sort of update the macro environment, a few things are true. One is the personal savings rate is a little bit lower than expected, Consumer spending\nremained robust while income was a bit lower. So that is all else equal decreasing balances per account in CCB. And as you obviously know, equity market\nperformance has been particularly strong, which is driving flows into investments, and we are capturing that in our Wealth Management business again, that is a\nlittle bit of a headwind to balances per account. And relative to the scenario that we had at the time, rates are a little bit higher than what was in the forwards and\nthat is producing again slightly higher than otherwise expected yield-seeking flows. They are still below the peak, but they are still a factor. So as we look forward\nfrom here, the drivers are all still in place if you break it down, a key driver is obviously ongoing net new accounts. And if you look at this quarter, been strong with\nover 400,000 net new checking accounts this quarter. And so what you are left with is just the question of how that average balance per customer evolves and\nwhen you hit the inflection point of that number, based on the factors that we have just gone through. And so the margin, that kind of upward inflection point has\nbeen pushed out a little bit. But at a high level, we remain quite confident about the overall long-term trajectory here and optimistic. But the macro environment\nshift is just slightly pushed out some of the growth inflection dynamics.\nJohn McDonald\nGot it. That is helpful. And maybe just sticking with that 2026 initial outlook, what are some of the other key assumptions in there particularly around commercial\ndeposits and maybe loan growth and rates?", "char_count": 2229, "word_count": 393, "token_count": 473, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

Yes. So as we always do, we are using the current forward curves as of September 30. So that has the relevant cuts are, I think. The impact of the 75 basis\npoints of cuts this year and I think as of the September, it was two twenty-five basis point cuts in the 2026. So that all else equal is obviously a headwind as we\nremain asset sensitive and the annualization of this year in the first half next year. And then offsetting that, you have all the growth dynamics, which include card\nrevolve growth, which has been obviously a significant tailwind it is going to slow down a little bit given that the normalization of REVOLVE is close to complete\nnow, but we still see very healthy acquisition dynamics there. So that will be a growth driver, albeit a little bit lower. And similarly, I mean pivoting a little bit to\ndeposit for a second, just talked about the contribution of deposit balance growth to that, which will be a factor. In wholesale deposits, it was a very strong growth\nyear this year. So we would expect it to be a little bit more muted next year, but core franchise is doing great. And then wholesale loan growth will kind of be what\nit is. But trends there are solid. So it is the usual mix of rate headwinds offsetting balanced growth and mix.

So my question is both of demand and credit fundamentals, What are you seeing in terms of drivers of client demand\nthere on the lending side? Wholesale front?

I will do my best to try to help. So let me just get one thing out of the way because you were sort of polite enough not to touch on it, but I already kind of \ndisclosed it on the press call. We generally, as you know, Glenn, are not in the habit of talking about individual borrower situations. But given the amount of public \nattention, the Tri Color thing has gotten in particular, I think it is worth just saying that that is contributing $170 million of charge-offs in the quarter, which we call \nout on the wholesale side. Also worth noting, there has been a lot of attention on the first brand situation. Do not have any exposure to them. So anyway, that is \njust worth getting out of the way. So you asked about demand and you asked about public private differentiation. On the demand side, I really think I mean not to \noveruse the phrase, but from the perspective of our franchise, this kind of moment of revived animal spirits, let us say, is driving demand. We are seeing very \nhealthy deal flow. We are seeing acquisition finance come back. Obviously, we were very involved in a particularly large deal this quarter. And I would say \nbroadly, and maybe this goes a little bit also to public private point, are kind of product agnostic credit strategy across the whole continuum is playing out very \nnicely. And I think some of the events of the quarter prove that like now when you have got something big to do, the right people to call and we will give you the \nbest solution across a very complete full product suite. You asked whether we are seeing differentiation in fundamentals between private and public spaces. I do \nnot know. I have not heard that particularly. Think it probably depends a little bit on how you define the spaces and what you are differentiating. Like obviously, to \nmake the obvious point like subprime auto has been a challenging space for people in that industry. But that is probably not quite what you meant by private \ncredit. And I have not heard anything to suggest that the private deals are performing differently from the public deals. It probably is true at the margin, that some \nof the new direct lending initiatives involve underwriting at slightly higher expected losses and that is significant because as we have been discussing here, the \nwholesale charge-off rate has been very, very low for a long time. And I think simply having that normalized would produce some increases in wholesale \ncharge-offs. And obviously, as we have been discussing a lot in consumer over the last couple of years, when you are in that normalization moment, you are \nconstantly wondering, is this a normalization or have we switched to deterioration? I do not know if we are seeing that yet in wholesale, but it is also worth noting\n\nthat the current portfolio is going to have a slightly different mix from what we have had over the last ten or fifteen years. And so the expected charge-off rate is\ngoing to be a little bit higher, all else equal, but obviously that comes with appropriate revenues and returns.", "char_count": 3055, "word_count": 542, "token_count": 632, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

And I think for us, running a company of this type we need to\nmake sure we stay anchored in like facts and reality and tangible outcomes. So we are putting a lot of energy into this. A lot of people are spending a lot of time\non it. We are spending a lot of money on it. We have very deep experts. As Jamie always says, we have been doing it for a long time, well before the current\ngenerative AI boom. But in the end, the proof is going to be in the pudding in terms of actually slowing the growth of expenses. And so what we are doing is kind\nof rather than saying you must prove that you are generating this much savings from AI, which turns out to be a very hard thing to do. Hard to prove and might at\nthe margin result in people scrambling around to use AI in ways that actually not efficient and that distract you from doing underlying process reengineering that\nyou need to do. What we are saying instead is, let us just do old-fashioned expense discipline. And constrain people's growth, constrain people's heads growth.\nWe have talked about that last year. We are going to do the same this year. I have a very strong bias against having the reflective response to any given need to\nbe to hire more people. And feeling a little bit more confident on our ability to put pressure on the organization because we know even if we cannot always\nmeasure it that precisely, are definitely productivity tailwinds from AI. So that is how we are going to do it. And hopefully, that will show up. In lower growth than\nwe would have had otherwise. But a lot of the drivers of growth, which are per capita labor inflation and revenue-related expense and investments, are always\ngoing to be there. We are never going to stop doing those things. So that is how we think about it.", "char_count": 2199, "word_count": 412, "token_count": 473, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

All right. So let me do what you asked Mike and put a little bit of context around this. So a couple of just some housekeeping first. So talked about Tri Color,\nyou talked about First Brands. I just want to reiterate, we do not have any exposure to First Brands. On Tricolor, it represents $170 million of the wholesale\ncharge-off this quarter. Obviously, by definition, that reflects on balance sheet loans that we are charging off. And with respect to other exposures, I do not really\nhave anything additional to say about that at this point. It will play out as it plays out. But in the normal course, we are always quite conservative about taking all\npossible hits that we can based on what is knowable upfront. So pick up or whatever it is worth. More generally, I think one thing that is important to say in terms\nof context about NBFI lending is that the vast majority of that type of lending that we do is highly secured or in some way structured or securitized. In other words,\nit is not like we are doing extremely high risk, low rated lending the NVFI community. And so that does not mean that there is no risk. That does not mean that\nthings cannot go wrong. And obviously, if you are doing secured lending and there are problems with the collateral, that is an issue, which is clearly relevant in the\ncase of Tricolor. So and we have talked a lot about the question about risk inside the regulated perimeter versus risk outside the regulated perimeter. But we have\nalso acknowledged that a lot of the private credit actors are large, very sophisticated, very good at credit underwriting. So I think you are supposed to jump in\nconfuse them that they are necessarily lower standards. There are a huge systemic problem. And to the extent that we lend to some of these folks who are clients\nof ours as well as competitors of ours, that lending follows our normal practices. It is often highly secured. And everything we do is in one way or another risky.\nBut I am not sure that our lending to the NBFI community is an area of risk that we see as more elevated than other areas of risk, I guess, is what I would say.\nYes. Mike, I would just add that it is a very large category non-bank financial institutions and probably a number like half of it we will consider very traditional not\nlike different. There is a component which is different today than it was years ago and there is a component which is not that different, but if you look at like CLOs\nand lending to leveraged entities that are underwritten with leveraged loans. So there is kind of a little bit of double leverage in I would say that yes, there will be\nadditional risk in the that category. That we will see when we have a downturn. I expect to be a little bit worse than other people expected to be because we know\nall the underwriting standards that all these people did. Jeremy said these are very smart players. They know what they are doing. They have been around a long\ntime. But they are not all very smart. And we do not even know the standards that other banks underwriting to some of these entities. And I would suspect that\nsome of those deals may not be as good as you think. Hopefully, we are very good, though we make our mistakes too. Obviously. So yes, I think you would be a\nlittle bit worse. We have had a benign credit environment for so long that I think you may see credit in other places deteriorate a little bit more than people think.\nWhen in fact there is a downturn. And hopefully, it will be a fulfilling normal credit cycle with What always happens is something is worse than a normal credit\ncycle and the normal downturn. So we will see. But we think we are quite careful and obviously we scoured the world looking for things that we should be worried\nabout. But I do remind you, we have had a bull market for a long time.

Thanks for that, Gerard. So I agree with you. This administration is the same things and from what we are seeing transitioning to action quite quickly. So \nwhat we are seeing from our engagement in Washington and there has been some reporting in the press recently that is quite comprehensive on the evolution of \npotential new control proposals, which is aligned with what we are hearing as well. But in general, there is a bias for action, getting things done quickly, and they \nare looking at things quite comprehensively. What we see. And as you know, we have argued for a long time, Jamie has argued a lot that this is not about some \noverall calibration of the system, some like back solving exercise for some number of whatever type. This is about looking at all the individual components, of the \ncapital rules understood holistically, doing the math right and letting that roll up to whatever answer it going to be. And by the way that answer is going to be \ndifferent for different firms depending on their business mix. And that is okay. And that is part of the reason it does not really make sense to kind of try to calibrate \nto some overall level for the system. It is just like do the math right in a way that makes sense for the individual product or business area or source of risk. And \nyou will get a reasonable outcome for the system. And from what we are hearing, that is very much the direction of travel. The relevant agencies are working well \ntogether. There is a sense of urgency. And so we are encouraged. And I would note actually back to your first question that one area where getting things right at \nthe individual product level as relevant is allowing banks to play their appropriate role in the residential mortgage lending market when it in the instances where it \nmakes sense. Keep those instruments on the balance sheet, you want the capitalization of those to be reasonable aligned with the risk. And again, from what we \nunderstand, that is the direction of travel. So in terms of timing, I mean your guess is as good as mine. I think there have been some public comments, and I \nwould just anchor myself on those and the press reporting. But we definitely hear a desire to get things done quickly. And these things are complicated in some \nareas. Might have some disagreements at the margin. We would still dislike G SIB as a matter of principle. But we do not want to let the perfect be the enemy of \nthe good here. And what we are doing is trending in the right direction. And I can just add data number, they are doing that. They are looking at it holistically. That \nis great. But gaining the number is right. I have said for years, GSIB, CCAR, operational risk capital, double counting of trading book, I mean it is just wrong. And \nsome of these numbers are so inaccurate that they publish that they should publish them with the disclosure saying, we know these are highly inaccurate like the \nCCAR test. We know that this is not remotely related to reality and stuff like that. It is almost a dishonest disclosure of these terms. Like do the actual number. \nThe second thing they really should do which I think they are doing is what is the intended effect and what is the unintended effect? So we talk about we have got \neight thousand public commits 4,000 public companies we have gone from pushing mortgage out of the banking system to a huge buildup in parts non-bank free \ninstitutions and a huge amount of arbitrage taking place. If I was a regulator, I would be looking at all that and saying, my God, is that what I wanted? And the \nbiggest frustration is they could have fixed all these things, reduced liquidity, reduced capital. All these things and made the system safer. So we had a Silicon\n\nValley bank blow up because they are so focused on governance they forgot to focus on interest rate exposure. And they are making changes now like what is\nactually real risk banks in bearing as opposed to walk signaling what a bank should be doing all the time. So hopefully, they will do it. I think they are devoted to\ndoing it. Like look at their words, their speeches. I am talking about the OCC, the Fed, the FDIC. I think it is very good.

So yes, a couple of things about that. One is not to get too much into the weeds here, but our expenses are a little bit seasonal. So annualizing the fourth\nquarter like sometimes you get a bunch of offsets and it is like okay to do that, sometimes it is not. So we always try to do this based on a sort of launch point of\nthe annualized fourth quarter rate. And while that is a reasonable thing to do for NII, it is a lot harder to do for expenses. But taking a step back for a second, I am\nnot telling you anything that you do not already know. Like you can look at whatever ECI or whatever other government measure of labor cost inflation. We know\nthat even while inflation is like a lot lower, we are very far from the moment the mid-2010s where inflation was for all intents and purposes zero. So yes, I think the\nnew normal for labor is some number like that, whatever, 3%, 4%. And it is not just labor, I mean, again, I do not want to fail to recognize the extent to inflation\nhas more or less come back to normal. But by normal, we mean the Fed target. And for a while, it was below target. So whether it is labor or goods and services,\nnot to get into tariffs or whatever, that is a factor that applies to our entire cost base. In addition to that, as we noted, we are going to invest where it makes sense.\nWe are going to pay for performance to the extent that there is higher performance and also generally revenues will be associated with other variable expenses.\nAnd then overlying all of that, the question of productivity. And it includes, but is not limited to AI-driven productivity. So you can assume that we are going to be\npushing hard on all fronts to extract as much productivity out of the organization as possible. But as is always true, we are going to try to keep that focus separate\nfrom our commitment to invest for growth in the places where we want to. And could you just add to that? Medical, we spent $3 billion of so in medical. Going be\nup 10% next year. And so when you look at some of these things and we know that already and maybe think it actually might be up another 10% in 2027 for a\nwhole bunch of different reasons, And that is one thing. Another thing about comp I just want to point out, there is normal inflation and paper performance, all that.\nThere is a lot of pressure on from other people who are paying people quite well. Hedge funds, law firms, private equity, non-bank institutions, and we are going\nto pay our people competitively. That is a sine qua non if you want to have a great company for the next twenty years.

It is like a part of the rent cap rules. Yes. Want me to do that one first and you can do the first one? Yes. So even though I\ndo not remember what the I think it is like standardized securitization something, something. I forget what it stands for. But from what I recall about looking at that\none, I think it is a mechanism by which you can take what should be otherwise punitive risk weighting for certain types of structures. And reduce it from 100 to 20\nwhere arguably 20 is actually probably still too high because you have essentially mitigated the entire risk. So my first answer to your question is, of all the things\nto worry about I would not worry about that whatever you want to call it, protection enhancement or risk weighting decrease in that narrow context. And on your\nquestion of like what questions to ask about about the NVFI space in general, mean, Jamie will have his views. But yes, I think it starts by acknowledging that like\nit is a very, very broad space. And so we probably need to narrow the focus a little bit. Like subprime auto is one thing, lending to like trillion dollar asset\nmanagers on a secured basis is a very different thing. So Maybe we should take a crack at telling you a little bit more about it. We feel fairly comfortable with our\nexposures in that. But think what you should do is I think when we have a downturn, this is the important thing, there will be a credit cycle. And we should not be\nsurprised. The credit card laws will go up, middle market laws go up. Everything gets worse in a downturn in credit. I do suspect, I cannot prove this and I do not\nknow because we do not know everyone's underwriting standards. Every now and then we see what someone else is doing, we are surprised that there is\nstandards. And I am particularly good, but that is always been true. I suspect with the downturn, you will see higher than normal downturn type of credit losses in\ncertain I just suspect that.

If that plays into like flattening of the\nyield curve, other reasons etcetera beyond what is priced in the forward that could be a little bit of a different story. But I think what is clearly true, a little bit to the\npoint of your question is that the environment is is the results are very robust and the tone is very upbeat. I think an interesting thing from my perspective is to\nthink about the narrative starting from the beginning of the year, right? We had the moment of everyone was talking about animal spirits and big booming\nmoment. And then we had Liberation Day and all the tariff uncertainty and equity market volatility. And so things kind of went quiet for a while. But what is\ninteresting is that from the IPO perspective, for example, processes were kicked off early in the year. And those processes continued even during the moments\nwhere conditions were not ideal for the deals. And what that meant is that there is a lot of stuff like in the queue that is kind of ready to go. And now conditions are\nmuch more favorable both in terms of equity market valuations, at least until recently, relatively low equity market volatility, a bit more breadth in the rally in terms\nof multiples, including smaller cap tech sector or whatever. So, yes, that is one area. And in the meantime, as you know, we are starting to see more M and A\nactivity as well. I noted earlier, I think it was busiest summer we have had in like a long time in terms of announced M and A activity. We are seeing that play\nthrough into acquisition finance. I think the rate environment is good enough from the perspective of being able to get deals done.

And while there is a lot of puts and takes inside that number in terms of rewards liability, annual fees and so on,\nparticular dynamic that is happening now is that as part of the refresh, customers are getting increased value ahead of the moment where the annual fee goes up.\nSo there is a kind of transitional period of a few months as the refresh rolls through. Those numbers are slightly elevated. The fee comes in over a year and some\nof these rewards come in as negative NII over a year. Exactly. It is one example of like really bad accounting. Yes.

And\nthe other leading banks or other large banks, which have adopted similar pricing strategies are also seeing a little bit of loss of share. So that is from our\nperspective expected a conscious result of being disciplined about the pricing of deposits.

And interestingly, interestingly, when you look inside the\ngranular market by market results in that FDIC data, what we see is us actually taking share and a lot of the kind of highest priority, highest profile expansion\nmarket. So in that sense, it is actually a validation of strategy. And by the way, I got my answer on the wound guilt question. It is mix, including cards. So my\nguess was correct.
