Q4 was another record quarter. Revenue of $22.1 billion was up 22% sequentially and up to 265% year-on-year and well above our outlook of \n$20 billion. For fiscal 2024, revenue was $60.9 billion and up 126% from the prior year. Starting with data center. Data center revenue for the fiscal 2024 year was \n$47.5 billion, more than tripling from the prior year. The world has reached the tipping point of new computing era. The $1 trillion installed base of data center \ninfrastructure is rapidly transitioning from general purpose to accelerated computing. As Moore's Law slows while computing demand continues to skyrocket, \ncompanies may accelerate every workload possible to drive future improvement in performance, TCO and energy efficiency. At the same time, companies have \nstarted to build the next generation of modern data centers, what we refer to as AI factories, purpose built to refine raw data and produce valuable intelligence in \nthe era of generative AI. In the fourth quarter, data center revenue of $18.4 billion was a record, up 27% sequentially and up 409% year-over-year, driven by the \nNVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking. Compute revenue grew more than 5x and networking revenue tripled from \nlast year. We are delighted that supply of Hopper architecture products is improving. Demand for Hopper remains very strong. We expect our next-generation \nproducts to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply. Fourth quarter data center growth was driven by both training and inference of generative AI \nand large language models across a broad set of industries, use cases and regions. The versatility and leading performance of our data center platform enables a \nhigh return on investment for many use cases, including AI training and inference, data processing and a broad range of CUDA accelerated workloads. We \nestimate in the past year approximately 40% of data center revenue was for AI inference. Building and deploying AI solutions has reached virtually every industry. \nMany companies across industries are training and operating their AI models and services at scale, enterprises across NVIDIA AI infrastructure through cloud \nproviders, including hyperscales, GPU specialized and private clouds or on-premise. NVIDIA's computing stack extends seamlessly across cloud and on-premise \nenvironments, allowing customers to deploy with a multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud strategy. In the fourth quarter, large cloud providers represented more than half of \nour data center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external public cloud customers. Microsoft recently noted that more than 50,000 organizations \nuse GitHub Copilot business to supercharge the productivity of their developers, contributing to GitHub revenue growth accelerating to 40% year-over-year. And \nCopilot for Microsoft 365 adoption grew faster in its first two months than the two previous major Microsoft 365 enterprise suite releases did. Consumer internet \ncompanies have been early adopters of AI and represent one of our largest customer categories. Companies from search to e-commerce, social media, news \nand video services and entertainment are using AI for deep learning-based recommendation systems. These AI investments are generating a strong return by \nimproving customer engagement, ad conversation and click-throughs rates. Meta in its latest quarter cited more accurate predictions and improved advertiser \nperformance as contributing to the significant acceleration in its revenue. In addition, consumer internet companies are investing in generative AI to support \ncontent creators, advertisers and customers through automation tools for content and ad creation, online product descriptions and AI shopping assistance. \nEnterprise software companies are applying generative AI to help customers realize productivity gains. Early customers we've partnered with for both training and \ninference of generative AI are already seeing notable commercial success. ServiceNow's generative AI products in their latest quarter drove their largest ever net \nnew annual contract value contribution of any new product family release. We are working with many other leading AI and enterprise software platforms as well, \nincluding Adobe, Databricks, Getty Images, SAP and Snowflake. The field of foundation of large-language models is thriving. Anthropic, Google, Inflection, \nMicrosoft, OpenAI and xAI are leading with continued amazing breakthrough in generative AI. Exciting companies like Adept, AI21, Character.ai, Cohere, Mistral, \nPerplexity and Runway are building platforms to serve enterprises and creators. New startups are creating LLMs to serve the specific languages, cultures and \ncustoms of the world many regions. And others are creating foundation models to address entirely different industries like Recursion Pharmaceuticals and \nGenerate:Biomedicines for biology. These companies are driving demand for NVIDIA AI infrastructure through hyperscale or GPU specialized cloud providers. \nJust this morning, we announced that we've collaborated with Google to optimize its state-of-the art new Gemma language models to accelerate their inference \nperformance on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud data center and PC. One of the most notable trends over the past year is the significant adoption of AI by enterprises \nacross the industry verticals such as automotive, healthcare and financial services. NVIDIA offers multiple application frameworks to help companies adopt AI in \nvertical domains such as autonomous driving, drug discovery, low latency machine learning for fraud detection or robotics, leveraging our full stack accelerated \ncomputing platform. We estimate the data center revenue contribution of the automotive vertical through the cloud or on-prem exceeded $1 billion last year. \nNVIDIA DRIVE infrastructure solutions includes systems and software for the development of autonomous driving, including data ingestion, creation, labeling and \nAI training, plus validation through simulation. Almost 80 vehicle manufacturers across global OEMs, new energy vehicles, trucking, robotaxi and Tier 1 suppliers \nare using NVIDIA's AI infrastructure to train LLMs and other AI models for automated driving and AI cockpit applications. And in fact, nearly every automotive \ncompany working on AI is working with NVIDIA. As AV algorithms move to video transformers and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA's \nautomotive data center processing demand to grow significantly. In healthcare, digital biology and generative AI are helping to reinvent drug discovery, surgery, \nmedical imaging and wearable devices. We have built deep domain expertise in healthcare over the past decade, creating the NVIDIA Clara healthcare platform \nand NVIDIA BioNeMo, a generative AI service to develop, customize and deploy AI foundation models for computer-aided drug discovery. BioNeMo features a\n\ngrowing collection of pre-trained Biomolecular AI models that can be applied to the end-to-end drug discovery processes. We announced Recursion is making\navailable for their proprietary AI model through BioNeMo for the drug discovery ecosystem. In financial services, customers are using AI for a growing set of use\ncases from trading and risk management to customer service and fraud detection. For example, American Express improved fraud detection accuracy by 6%\nusing NVIDIA AI. Shifting to our data center revenue by geography. Growth was strong across all regions, except for China where our data center revenue\ndeclined significantly following the U.S. government export control regulations imposed in October. Although we have not received licenses from the U.S.\ngovernment to ship restricted products to China, we have started shipping alternatives that don't require a license for the China market. China represented a\nmid-single digit percentage of our data center revenue in Q4. And we expect it to stay in a similar range in the first-quarter. In regions outside of the U.S. and\nChina, sovereign AI has become an additional demand driver. Countries around the world are investing in AI infrastructure to support the building of\nlarge-language models in their own language, on domestic data and in support of their local research and enterprise ecosystems. From a product perspective, the\nvast majority of revenue was driven by our Hopper architecture along with InfiniBand networking. Together, they have emerged as the de-facto standard for\naccelerated computing and AI infrastructure. We are on track to ramp H200 with initial shipments in the second quarter. Demand is strong as H200 nearly\ndoubles the inference performance of H100. Networking exceeded a $13 billion annualized revenue run rate. Our end-to-end networking solutions define modern\nAI data centers. Our Quantum InfiniBand solutions grew more than 5x year on year. NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand is the standard for the highest performance\nAI-dedicated infrastructures. We are now entering the ethernet networking space with the launch of our new Spectrum-X end-to-end offering designed for an\nAI-optimized networking for the data center. Spectrum-X introduces new technologies over ethernet, that are purpose built for AI. Technologies incorporated in\nour Spectrum switch, BlueField DPU and software stack deliver 1.6x higher networking performance for AI processing compared with traditional ethernet. Leading\nOEMs, including Dell, HPE, Lenovo and Super Micro, with their global sales channels, are partnering with us to expand our AI solution to enterprises worldwide.\nWe are on track to ship Spectrum-X this quarter. We also made great progress with our software and services offerings, which reached an annualized revenue\nrun rate of $1 billion in Q4. We announced that NVIDIA DGX Cloud will expand its list of partners to include Amazon's AWS, joining Microsoft Azure, Google\nCloud and Oracle Cloud. DGX Cloud is used for NVIDIA's own AI R&D and custom model development as well as NVIDIA developers. It brings the CUDA\necosystem to NVIDIA CSP partners. Okay, moving to gaming. Gaming revenue was $2.87 billion, was flat sequentially and up 56% year on year, better than our\noutlook on solid consumer demand for NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs during the holidays. Fiscal year revenue of $10.45 billion was up 15%. At CES, we\nannounced our GeForce RTX 40 Super Series family of GPUs. Starting at $599, they deliver incredible gaming performance and generative AI capabilities. Sales\nare off to a great start. NVIDIA AI Tensor cores and the GPUs deliver up to 836 AI tops, perfect for powering AI for gaming, creating an everyday productivity. The\nrich software stack we offer with our RTX GPUs further accelerates AI. With our DLSS technologies, seven out of eight pixels can be AI generated, resulting up to\n4x faster ray tracing and better image quality. And with the Tensor RT LLM for Windows, our open-source library that accelerates inference performance for the\nlatest large-language models generative AI can run up to 5X faster on RTX AI PCs. At CES, we also announced a wave of new RTX 40 Series AI laptops from\nevery major OEMs. These bring high-performance gaming and AI capabilities to a wide range of form factors, including 14 inch and thin and light laptops. With up\nto 686 tops of AI performance, these next-generation AI PCs increase generative AI performance by up to 60x, making them the best-performing AI PC platforms.\nAt CES, we announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine microservices, which allowed developers to integrate state-of-the-art generative AI models into digital\navatars. ACE won several Best of CES 2024 awards. NVIDIA has an end-to-end platform for building and deploying generative AI applications for RTX PCs and\nworkstations. This includes libraries, SDKs, tools and services developers can incorporate into their generative AI workloads. NVIDIA is fueling the next wave of\ngenerative AI applications coming to the PC. With over 100 million RTX PCs in the installed-base and over 500 AI-enabled PC applications and games, we are on\nour way. Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue of $463 million was up 11% sequentially and up 105% year on year. Fiscal year revenue of $1.55 billion was up\n1%. Sequential growth in the quarter was driven by a rich mix of RTX Ada architecture GPUs continuing to ramp. Enterprises are refreshing their workstations to\nsupport generative AI-related workloads, such as data preparation, LLM fine-tuning and retrieval augmented generation. These key industrial verticals driving\ndemand include manufacturing, automotive and robotics. The automotive industry has also been an early adopter of NVIDIA Omniverse as it seeks to digitize\nwork flows from design to build, simulate, operate and experience their factories and cars. At CES, we announced that creative partners and developers including\nBrickland, WPP and ZeroLight are building Omniverse-powered car configurators. Leading automakers like LOTUS are adopting the technology to bring new\nlevels of personalization, realism and interactivity to the car buying experience. Moving to Automotive. Revenue was $281 million, up 8% sequentially and down\n4% year on year. Fiscal year revenue of $1.09 billion was up 21%, crossing the $1 billion mark for the first time on continued adoption of the NVIDIA DRIVE\nplatform by automakers. NVIDIA DRIVE Orin is the AI car computer of choice for software-defined AV fleets. Its successor, NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, designed for\nvision transformers often -- offers more AI performance and integrates a wide range of intelligent capabilities into a single AI compute platform, including\nautonomous driving and parking, driver and passenger monitoring and AI cockpit functionality and will be available next year. There were several automotive\ncustomer announcements this quarter, Li Auto, Great Wall Motor, ZEEKR, the premium EV subsidiary of Geely and Jeremy Xiaomi EV all announced new\nvehicles built on NVIDIA. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins expanded sequentially to 76% and non-GAAP gross margins to 76.7% on strong\ndata center growth and mix. Our gross margins in Q4 benefited from favorable component costs. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 6% and\nnon-GAAP operating expenses were up 9%, primarily reflecting higher compute and infrastructure investments and employee growth. In Q4, we returned $2.8\nbillion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. During fiscal year '24, we utilized cash of $9.9 billion towards shareholder returns,\nincluding $9.5 billion in share repurchases. Let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $24 billion, plus or minus 2%. We\nexpect sequential growth in data center and proviz, partially offset by seasonal decline in gaming. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 76.3%\nand 77% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis-points. Similar to Q4, Q1 gross margins are benefiting from favorable component costs. Beyond Q1, for the\nremainder of the year, we expect gross margins to return to the mid-70s percent range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be\napproximately $3.5 billion and $2.5 billion respectively. Fiscal year 2025 GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid-30% range as\nwe continue to invest in the large opportunities ahead of us. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately\n$250 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1% excluding\nany discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight\nsome upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the Morgan Stanley Technology and Media and Telecom Conference in San Francisco on\nMarch 4 and the TD Cowen's 44th Annual Healthcare Conference in Boston on March 5. And of course, please join us for our Annual DTC conference starting\nMonday March 18 in San Jose, California, to be held in-person for the first time in five years. DTC will kick off with Jen-Hsun's keynote and we will host a Q&A\nsession for financial analysts the next day, March 19. At this time, we will now open the call for questions.

Yeah. Well, we guide one quarter at a time. But fundamentally, the conditions are excellent for continued growth calendar '24, to calendar '25 and beyond.\nAnd let me tell you why? We're at the beginning of two industry-wide transitions and both of them are industry wide. The first one is a transition from general to\naccelerated computing. General-purpose computing, as you know, is starting to run out of steam. And you can tell by the CSPs extending and many data centers,\nincluding our own for general-purpose computing, extending the depreciation from four to six years. There's just no reason to update with more CPUs when you\ncan't fundamentally and dramatically enhance its throughput like you used to. And so you have to accelerate everything. This is what NVIDIA has been pioneering\nfor some time. And with accelerated computing, you can dramatically improve your energy efficiency. You can dramatically improve your cost in data processing\nby 20 to 1. Huge numbers. And of course, the speed. That speed is so incredible that we enabled a second industry-wide transition called generative AI.\nGenerative AI, I'm sure we're going to talk plenty -- plenty about it during the call. But remember, generative AI is a new application. It is enabling a new way of\ndoing software, new types of software are being created. It is a new way of computing. You can't do generative AI on traditional general-purpose computing. You\nhave to accelerate it. And the third is it is enabling a whole new industry, and this is something worthwhile to take a step back and look at and it connects to your\nlast question about sovereign AI. A whole new industry in the sense that for the very first time a data center is not just about computing data and storing data and\nserving the employees of a company. We now have a new type of data center that is about AI generation, an AI generation factory. And you've heard me\ndescribe it as AI factories. But basically, it takes raw material, which is data, it transforms it with these AI supercomputers that NVIDIA builds, and it turns them\ninto incredibly valuable tokens. These tokens are what people experience on the amazing ChatGPT or Midjourney or, search these days are augmented by that.\nAll of your recommender systems are now augmented by that, the hyper-personalization that goes along with it. All of these incredible startups in digital biology,\ngenerating proteins and generating chemicals and the list goes on. And so all of these tokens are generated in a very specialized type of data center. And this\ndata center we call AI supercomputers and AI generation factories. But we're seeing diversity -- one of the other reasons -- so at the foundation is that. The way it\nmanifests into new markets is in all of the diversity that you're seeing us in. One, the amount of inference that we do is just off the charts now. Almost every single\ntime you interact with ChatGPT, that we're inferencing. Every time you use Midjourney, we're inferencing. Every time you see amazing -- these Sora videos that\nare being generated or Runway, the videos that they're editing, Firefly, NVIDIA is doing inferencing. The inference part of our business has grown tremendously.\nWe estimate about 40%. The amount of training is continuing, because these models are getting larger and larger, the amount of inference is increasing. But\nwe're also diversifying into new industries. The large CSPs are still continuing to build out. You can see from their CapEx and their discussions, but there's a\nwhole new category called GPU specialized CSPs. They specialize in NVIDIA AI infrastructure, GPU specialized CSPs. You're seeing enterprise software\nplatforms deploying AI. ServiceNow is just a really, really great example. You see Adobe. There's the others, SAP and others. You see consumer Internet\nservices that are now augmenting all of their services of the past with generative AI. So they can have even more hyper-personalized content to be created. You\nsee us talking about industrial generative AI. Now our industries represent multi-billion dollar businesses, auto, health, financial services. In total, our vertical\nindustries are multi-billion dollar businesses now. And of course sovereign AI. The reason for sovereign AI has to do with the fact that the language, the\nknowledge, the history, the culture of each region are different and they own their own data. They would like to use their data, train it with to create their own\ndigital intelligence and provision it to harness that raw material themselves. It belongs to them, each one of the regions around the world. The data belongs to\nthem. The data is most useful to their society. And so they want to protect the data. They want to transform it themselves, value-added transformation, into AI and\nprovision those services themselves. So we're seeing sovereign AI infrastructure is being built in Japan, in Canada, in France, so many other regions. And so my\nexpectation is that what is being experienced here in the United States, in the West, will surely be replicated around the world, and these AI generation factories\nare going to be in every industry, every company, every region. And so I think the last -- this last year, we've seen a generative AI really becoming a whole new\napplication space, a whole new way of doing computing, a whole new industry is being formed and that's driving our growth.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.

The estimate is probably understated. And -- but we estimated it. And let me tell you why. Whenever -- a year ago, the recommender systems \nthat people are -- when you run the internet, the news, the videos, the music, the products that are being recommended to you because as you know, the internet \nhas trillions -- I don't know how many trillions, but trillions of things out there and your phone is 3-inches square. And so the ability for them to fit all of that \ninformation down to something, such a small real estate, is through a system, an amazing system called recommender systems. These recommender systems \nused to be all based on CPU approaches. But the recent migration to deep learning and now generative AI has really put these recommender systems now \ndirectly into the path of GPU acceleration.

The list of components that we ship -- as you\nknow, people think that NVIDIA GPUs is like a chip. But the NVIDIA Hopper GPU has 35,000 parts. It weighs 70 pounds. These things are really complicated\nthings we've built. People call it an AI supercomputer for good reason. If you ever look in the back of the data center, the systems, the cabling system is mind\nboggling. It is the most dense complex cabling system for networking the world's ever seen. Our InfiniBand business grew 5x year over year. The supply chain is\nreally doing fantastic supporting us. And so overall, the supply is improving. We expect the demand will continue to be stronger than our supply provides and --\nthrough the year and we'll do our best. The cycle times are improving and we're going to continue to do our best. However, whenever we have new products, as\nyou know, it ramps from zero to a very large number. And you can't do that overnight. Everything is ramped up. It doesn't step up. And so whenever we have a\nnew generation of products -- and right now, we are ramping H200's. There is no way we can reasonably keep up on demand in the short term as we ramp. We're\nramping Spectrum-X. We're doing incredibly well with Spectrum-X. It's our brand-new product into the world of ethernet. InfiniBand is the standard for\nAI-dedicated systems. Ethernet with Spectrum-X --ethernet is just not a very good scale-out system. But with Spectrum-X, we've augmented, layered on top of\nethernet, fundamental new capabilities like adaptive routing, congestion control, noise isolation or traffic isolation, so that we could optimize ethernet for AI. And\nso InfiniBand will be our AI-dedicated infrastructure. Spectrum-X will be our AI-optimized networking and that is ramping, and so we'll -- with all of the new\nproducts, demand is greater than supply.

Every single version and every species that have come\nalong, vision transformers, multi-modality transformers, every single -- and now time sequence stuff, and every single variation, every single species of AI that has\ncome along, we've been able to support it, optimize our stack for it and deploy it into our installed base. This is really the great amazing part. On the one hand, we\ncan invent new architectures and new technologies like our Tensor cores, like our transformer engine for Tensor cores, improved new numerical formats and\nstructures of processing like we've done with the different generations of Tensor cores, meanwhile, supporting the installed base at the same time. And so, as a\nresult, we take all of our new software algorithm invest -- inventions, all of the inventions, new inventions of models of the industry, and it runs on our installed\nbase on the one hand. On the other hand, whenever we see something revolutionary we can -- like transformers, we can create something brand new like the\nHopper transformer engine and implement it into future. And so we simultaneously have this ability to bring software to the installed base and keep making it\nbetter and better and better, so our customers installed base is enriched over time with our new software. On the other hand, for new technologies, create\nrevolutionary capabilities. Don't be surprised if in our future generation, all of a sudden amazing breakthroughs in large-language models were made possible And\nthose breakthroughs, some of which will be in software because they run CUDA, will be made available to the installed base.

As you know,\naccelerated computing is very different than general-purpose computing. You're not starting from a program like C++. You compile it and things run on all your\nCPUs. The stacks of software necessary for every domain from data processing SQL versus -- SQL structure data versus all the images and text and PDF, which\nis unstructured, to classical machine-learning to computer vision to speech to large-language models, all --recommender systems. All of these things require\ndifferent software stacks. That's the reason why NVIDIA has hundreds of libraries. If you don't have software, you can't open new markets. If you don't have\nsoftware, you can't open and enable new applications. Software is fundamentally necessary for accelerated computing. This is the fundamental difference\nbetween accelerated computing and general-purpose computing that most people took a long time to understand. And now, people understand that the software\nis really key. And the way that we work with CSPs, that's really easy. We have large teams that are working with their large teams. However, now that generative\nAI is enabling every enterprise and every enterprise software company to embrace accelerated computing -- and when -- it is now essential to embrace\naccelerated computing because it is no longer possible, no longer likely anyhow to sustain improved throughput through just general-purpose computing. All of\nthese enterprise software companies and enterprise companies don't have large engineering teams to be able to maintain and optimize their software stack to run\nacross all of the world's clouds and private clouds and on-prem. So we are going to do the management, the optimization, the patching, the tuning, the\ninstalled-base optimization for all of their software stacks. And we containerize them into our stack. We call it NVIDIA AI Enterprise. And the way we go to market\nwith it is that think of that NVIDIA AI Enterprise now as a run time like an operating system, it's an operating system for artificial intelligence. And we charge\n$4,500 per GPU per year. And my guess is that every enterprise in the world, every software enterprise company that are deploying software in all the clouds and\nprivate clouds and on-prem, will run on NVIDIA AI Enterprise, especially obviously for our GPUs. And so this is going to likely be a very significant business over\ntime. We're off to a great start. And Colette mentioned that it's already at $1 billion run rate and we're really just getting started.\nOperator\nThank you.

The trillion-dollar installed base of data centers is transitioning from general\npurpose to accelerated computing. Every data center will be accelerated so the world can keep up with the computing demand, with increasing throughput, while\nmanaging costs and energy. The incredible speed up of NVIDIA enabled -- that NVIDIA enabled, a whole new computing paradigm, generative AI, where\nsoftware can learn, understand and generate any information from human language to the structure of biology and the 3D world. We are now at the beginning of\na new industry where AI-dedicated data centers process massive raw data to refine it into digital intelligence. Like AC power generation plants of the last\nindustrial revolution, NVIDIA AI supercomputers are essentially AI generation factories of this Industrial Revolution. Every company in every industry is\nfundamentally built on their proprietary business intelligence, and in the future, their proprietary generative AI. Generative AI has kicked off a whole new\ninvestment cycle to build the next trillion dollars of infrastructure of AI generation factories. We believe these two trends will drive a doubling of the world's data\ncenter infrastructure installed base in the next five years and will represent an annual market opportunity in the hundreds of billions. This new AI infrastructure will\nopen up a whole new world of applications not possible today. We started the AI journey with the hyperscale cloud providers and consumer internet companies.\nAnd now, every industry is on board, from automotive to healthcare to financial services, to industrial to telecom, media and entertainment. NVIDIA's full stack\ncomputing platform with industry-specific applications frameworks and a huge developer and partner ecosystem, gives us the speed, scale and reach to help\nevery company -- to help companies in every industry become an AI company. We have so much to share with you at next month's GTC in San Jose. So be sure\nto join us. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.\n\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference call.
