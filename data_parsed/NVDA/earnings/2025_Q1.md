## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Stacy Rasgon (Bernstein)**: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, I wanted to drill a little bit into the Blackwell comment that it's in full production now. What does that
suggest with regard to shipments and delivery timing if that product is -- doesn't sound like it's sampling anymore. What does that mean when that's actually in
customers' hands if it's in production now?

### Exchange 002

**Stacy Rasgon (Bernstein)**: Got it. So this year, we will see Blackwell revenue, it sounds like?

### Exchange 003

**Timothy Arcuri (UBS)**: Thanks a lot. I wanted to ask, Jensen, about the deployment of Blackwell versus Hopper just between the systems nature and all the demand for GB that you
have. How does the deployment of this stuff differ from Hopper? I guess I ask because liquid cooling at scale hasn't been done before, and there's some
engineering challenges both at the node level and within the data center. So do these complexities sort of elongate the transition? And how do you sort of think
about how that's all going? Thanks.

### Exchange 004

**Vivek Arya (Bank of America)**: Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, how are you ensuring that there is enough utilization of your products and that there isn't a pull-ahead or holding behavior
because of tight supply, competition or other factors? Basically, what checks have you built in the system to give us confidence that monetization is keeping pace
with your really very strong shipment growth?

### Exchange 005

**Toshiya Hari (Goldman Sachs)**: Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, I wanted to ask about competition. I think many of your cloud customers have announced new or updates
to their existing internal programs, right, in parallel to what they're working on with you guys. To what extent did you consider them as competitors, medium to
long term? And in your view, do you think they're limited to addressing most internal workloads or could they be broader in what they address going forward?
Thank you.

### Exchange 006

**Mark Lipacis (Evercore)**: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, in the past, you've made the observation that general-purpose computing ecosystems typically dominated each
computing era. And I believe the argument was that they could adapt to different workloads, get higher utilization, drive cost of compute cycle down. And this is a
motivation for why you were driving to a general-purpose GPU CUDA ecosystem for accelerated computing. And if I mischaracterized that observation, please do
let me know. So the question is, given that the workloads that are driving demand for your solutions are being driven by neural network training and inferencing,
which on the surface seem like a limited number of workloads, then it might also seem to lend themselves to custom solutions. And so then the question is about
does the general purpose computing framework become more at risk or is there enough variability or a rapid enough evolution on these workloads that support
that historical general purpose framework? Thank you.

### Exchange 007

**Blayne Curtis (Jefferies)**: Thanks for taking my question. Actually kind of curious, I mean, being supply constrained, how do you think about , I mean, you came out with a product for
China, H20. I'm assuming there'd be a ton of demand for it, but obviously, you're trying to serve your customers with the other Hopper products. Just kind of
curious how you're thinking about that in the second half. You could elaborate any impact, what you're thinking for sales as well as gross margin.

### Exchange 008

**Srini Pajjuri (Raymond James)**: Thank you. Jensen, actually more of a clarification on what you said. GB 200 systems, it looks like there is a significant demand for systems. Historically, I think
you've sold a lot of HGX boards and some GPUs and the systems business was relatively small. So I'm just curious, why is it that now you are seeing such a
strong demand for systems going forward? Is it just the TCO or is it something else or is it just the architecture? Thank you.
