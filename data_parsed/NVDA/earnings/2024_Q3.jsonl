{"doc_id": "NVDA_2024_Q3", "ticker": "NVDA", "year": 2024, "quarter": 3, "filing_date": "2024-09-01", "phase": "qa", "speaker_name": "Colette Kress", "speaker_role": "CFO", "speaker_firm": null, "utterance_id": "u_0001", "utterance_type": "answer", "text": "Thanks, Simona. Q3 was another record quarter. Revenue of $18.1 billion was up 34% sequentially and up more than 200% year-on-year and well above our \noutlook for $16 billion. Starting with Data Center. The continued ramp of the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper Tensor Core GPU architecture, along \nwith InfiniBand end-to-end networking, drove record revenue of $14.5 billion, up 41% sequentially and up 279% year-on-year. NVIDIA HGX with InfiniBand \ntogether are essentially the reference architecture for AI supercomputers and data center infrastructures. Some of the most exciting generative AI applications are \nbuilt and run on NVIDIA, including Adobe Firefly, ChatGPT, Microsoft 365 Copilot, CoAssist, now assist with ServiceNow and Zoom AI Companion. Our Data \nCenter compute revenue quadrupled from last year and networking revenue nearly tripled. Investments in infrastructure for training and inferencing large \nlanguage models, deep learning, recommender systems and generative AI applications is fueling strong broad-based demand for NVIDIA accelerated computing. \nInferencing is now a major workload for NVIDIA AI computing. Consumer Internet companies and enterprises drove exceptional sequential growth in Q3, \ncomprising approximately half of our Data Center revenue and outpacing total growth. Companies like Meta are in full production with deep learning, \nrecommender systems and also investing in generative AI to help advertisers optimize images and text. Most major consumer Internet companies are racing to \nramp up generative AI deployment. The enterprise wave of AI adoption is now beginning. Enterprise software companies such as Adobe, Databricks, Snowflake \nand ServiceNow are adding AI copilots and the systems to their platforms. And broader enterprises are developing custom AI for vertical industry applications \nsuch as Tesla in autonomous driving. Cloud service providers drove roughly the other half of our Data Center revenue in the quarter. Demand was strong from all \nhyperscale CSPs, as well as from a broadening set of GPU-specialized CSPs globally that are rapidly growing to address the new market opportunities in AI. \nNVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU instances are now generally available in virtually every cloud with instances in high demand. We have significantly increased \nsupply every quarter this year to meet strong demand and expect to continue to do so next year. We will also have a broader and faster product launch cadence \nto meet the growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. Towards the end of the quarter, the U.S. government announced a new set of export control regulations \nfor China and other markets, including Vietnam and certain countries in the Middle East. These regulations require licenses for the export of a number of our \nproducts, including our Hopper and Ampere 100 and 800 series and several others. Our sales to China and other affected destinations derived from products that \nare now subject to licensing requirements have consistently contributed approximately 20% to 25% of Data Center revenue over the past few quarters. We expect \nthat our sales to these destinations will decline significantly in the fourth quarter. So we believe will be more than offset by strong growth in other regions. The \nU.S. government designed the regulation to allow the U.S. industry to provide data center compute products to markets worldwide, including China. Continuing to \ncompete worldwide as the regulations encourage, promotes U.S. technology leadership, spurs economic growth and supports U.S. jobs. For the highest \nperformance levels, the government requires licenses. For lower performance levels, the government requires a streamlined prior notification process. And for \nproducts even lower performance levels, the government does not require any notice at all. Following the government's clear guidelines, we are working to \nexpand our Data Center product portfolio to offer compliance solutions for each regulatory category, including products for which the U.S. government does not \nwish to have advance notice before each shipment. We are working with some customers in China and the Middle East to pursue licenses from the U.S. \ngovernment. It is too early to know whether these will be granted for any significant amount of revenue. Many countries are awakening to the need to invest in \nsovereign AI infrastructure to support economic growth and industrial innovation. With investments in domestic compute capacity, nations can use their own data \nto train LLMs and support their local generative AI ecosystems. For example, we are working with India's government and largest tech companies including \nInfosys, Reliance and Tata to boost their sovereign AI infrastructure. And French private cloud provider, Scaleway, is building a regional AI cloud based on \nNVIDIA H100 InfiniBand and NVIDIA's AI Enterprise software to fuel advancement across France and Europe. National investment in compute capacity is a new \neconomic imperative and serving the sovereign AI infrastructure market represents a multi-billion dollar opportunity over the next few years. From a product \nperspective, the vast majority of revenue in Q3 was driven by the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper GPU architecture with lower contribution from the \nprior generation Ampere GPU architecture. The new L40S GPU built for industry standard servers began to ship, supporting training and inference workloads \nacross a variety of consumers. This was also the first revenue quarter of our GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, which combines our ARM-based Grace CPU with \na Hopper GPU. Grace and Grace Hopper are ramping into a new multi-billion dollar product line. Grace Hopper instances are now available at GPU specialized \ncloud providers, and coming soon to Oracle Cloud. Grace Hopper is also getting significant traction with supercomputing customers. Initial shipments to Los \nAlamos National Lab and the Swiss National Supercomputing Center took place in the third quarter. The UK government announced it will build one of the world's \nfastest AI supercomputers called Isambard-AI with almost 5,500 Grace Hopper Superchips. German supercomputing center, Julich, also announced that it will \nbuild its next-generation AI supercomputer with close to 24,000 Grace Hopper Superchips and Quantum-2 InfiniBand, making it the world's most powerful AI \nsupercomputer with over 90 exaflops of AI performance. All-in, we estimate that the combined AI compute capacity of all the supercomputers built on Grace \nHopper across the U.S., Europe and Japan next year will exceed 200 exaflops with more wins to come. Inference is contributing significantly to our data center \ndemand, as AI is now in full production for deep learning, recommenders, chatbots, copilots and text to image generation and this is just the beginning. NVIDIA AI\n\noffers the best inference performance and versatility, and thus the lower power and cost of ownership. We are also driving a fast cost reduction curve. With the\nrelease of TensorRT-LLM, we now achieved more than 2x the inference performance for half the cost of inferencing LLMs on NVIDIA GPUs. We also announced\nthe latest member of the Hopper family, the H200, which will be the first GPU to offer HBM3e, faster, larger memory to further accelerate generative AI and LLMs.\nIt moves inference speed up to another 2x compared to H100 GPUs for running LLMs like Norma2 (ph). Combined, TensorRT-LLM and H200, increased\nperformance or reduced cost by 4x in just one year. With our customers changing their stack, this is a benefit of CUDA and our architecture compatibility.\nCompared to the A100, H200 delivers an 18x performance increase for inferencing models like GPT-3, allowing customers to move to larger models and with no\nincrease in latency. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud will be among the first CSPs to offer H200-based instances starting\nnext year. At last week's Microsoft Ignite, we deepened and expanded our collaboration with Microsoft across the entire stock. We introduced an AI foundry\nservice for the development and tuning of custom generative AI enterprise applications running on Azure. Customers can bring their domain knowledge and\nproprietary data and we help them build their AI models using our AI expertise and software stock in our DGX cloud, all with enterprise grade security and\nsupport. SAP and Amdocs are the first customers of the NVIDIA AI foundry service on Microsoft Azure. In addition, Microsoft will launch new confidential\ncomputing instances based on the H100. The H100 remains the top performing and most versatile platform for AI training and by a wide margin, as shown in the\nlatest MLPerf industry benchmark results. Our training cluster included more than 10,000 H100 GPUs or 3x more than in June, reflecting very efficient scaling.\nEfficient scaling is a key requirement in generative AI, because LLMs are growing by an order of magnitude every year. Microsoft Azure achieved similar results\non a nearly identical cluster, demonstrating the efficiency of NVIDIA AI in public cloud deployments. Networking now exceeds a $10 billion annualized revenue\nrun rate. Strong growth was driven by exceptional demand for InfiniBand, which grew fivefold year-on-year. InfiniBand is critical to gaining the scale and\nperformance needed for training LLMs. Microsoft made this very point last week, highlighting that Azure uses over 29,000 miles of InfiniBand cabling, enough to\ncircle the globe. We are expanding NVIDIA networking into the Ethernet space. Our new Spectrum-X end-to-end Ethernet offering with technologies, purpose\nbuilt for AI, will be available in Q1 next year. With support from leading OEMs, including Dell, HPE and Lenovo. Spectrum-X can achieve 1.6x higher networking\nperformance for AI communication compared to traditional Ethernet offerings. Let me also provide an update on our software and services offerings, where we\nare starting to see excellent adoption. We are on track to exit the year at an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion for our recurring software, support and\nservices offerings. We see two primary opportunities for growth over the intermediate term with our DGX cloud service and with our NVIDIA AI Enterprise\nsoftware, each reflects the growth of enterprise AI training and enterprise AI inference, respectively. Our latest DGX cloud customer announcement was this\nmorning as part of an AI research collaboration with Gentech, the biotechnology pioneer also plans to use our BioNeMo LLM framework to help accelerate and\noptimize their AI drug discovery platform. We now have enterprise AI partnership with Adobe, Dropbox, Getty, SAP, ServiceNow, Snowflake and others to come.\nOkay. Moving to Gaming. Gaming revenue of $2.86 billion was up 15% sequentially and up more than 80% year-on-year with strong demand in the important\nback-to-school shopping season with NVIDIA RTX ray tracing and AI technology now available at price points as low as $299. We entered the holidays with the\nbest-ever line-up for gamers and creators. Gaming has doubled relative to pre-COVID levels even against the backdrop of lackluster PC market performance.\nThis reflects the significant value we've brought to the gaming ecosystem with innovations like RTX and DLSS. The number of games and applications supporting\nthese technologies has exploded in that period, driving upgrades and attracting new buyers. The RTX ecosystem continues to grow. There are now over 475\nRTX-enabled games and applications. Generative AI is quickly emerging as the new pillar app for high performance PCs. NVIDIA RTX GPUs to find the most\nperformance AI PCs and workstations. We just released TensorRT-LLM for Windows, which speeds on-device LLM inference up by 4x. With an installed base of\nover 100 million, NVIDIA RTX is the natural platform for AI application developers. Finally, our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service continues to build\nmomentum. Its library of PC games surpassed 1,700 titles, including the launches of Alan Wake 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty and\nStarfield. Moving to the Pro Vis. Revenue of $416 million was up 10% sequentially and up 108% year-on year. NVIDIA RTX is the workstation platform of choice\nfor professional design, engineering and simulation use cases and AI is emerging as a powerful demand driver. Early applications include inference for AI imaging\nin healthcare and edge AI in smart spaces and the public sector. We launched a new line of desktop workstations based on NVIDIA RTX Ada Lovelace\ngeneration GPUs and ConnectX, SmartNICs offering up to 2x the AI processing ray tracing and graphics performance of the previous generations. These\npowerful new workstations are optimized for AI workloads such as fine tune AI models, training smaller models and running inference locally. We continue to\nmake progress on Omniverse, our software platform for designing, building and operating 3D virtual worlds. Mercedes-Benz is using Omniverse powered digital\ntwins to plan, design, build and operate its manufacturing and assembly facilities, helping it increase efficiency and reduce defects. Oxxon (ph) is also\nincorporating Omniverse into its manufacturing process, including end-to-end simulation for the entire robotics and automation pipeline, saving time and cost. We\nannounced two new Omniverse Cloud services for automotive digitalization available on Microsoft Azure, a virtual factory simulation engine and autonomous\nvehicle simulation engine. Moving to Automotive. Revenue was $261 million, up 3% sequentially and up 4% year-on year, primarily driven by continued growth in\nself-driving platforms based on NVIDIA DRIVE Orin SOC and the ramp of AI cockpit solutions with global OEM customers. We extended our automotive\npartnership of Foxconn to include NVIDIA DRIVE for our next-generation automotive SOC. Foxconn has become the ODM for EVs. Our partnership provides\nFoxconn with a standard AV sensor and computing platform for their customers to easily build a state-of-an-art safe and secure software defined car. Now we're\ngoing to move to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin expanded to 74% and non-GAAP gross margin to 75%, driven by higher Data Center sales and lower\nnet inventory reserve, including a 1 percentage point benefit from the release of previously reserved inventory related to the Ampere GPU architecture products.\nSequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 12% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 10%, primarily reflecting increased compensation and\nbenefits. Let me turn to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Total revenue is expected to be $20 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect strong sequential growth to be\ndriven by Data Center, with continued strong demand for both compute and networking. Gaming will likely decline sequentially as it is now more aligned with\nnotebook seasonality. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.5% and 75.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and\nnon-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.17 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses\nare expected to be an income of approximately $200 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are\nexpected to be 15%, plus or minus 1% excluding any discrete items. Further financial information are included in the CFO commentary and other information\navailable on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the UBS Global Technology\nConference in Scottsdale, Arizona, on November 28; the Wells Fargo TMT Summit in Rancho Palos Verdes, California on November 29; the Arete Virtual Tech\nConference on December 7; and the J.P. Morgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco on January 8. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our fourth\nquarter and fiscal 2024 is scheduled for Wednesday, February 21. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America.

We\nare expecting in our guidance for that to decrease substantially as we move into Q4. The export controls will have a negative effect on our China business. And\nwe do not have good visibility into the magnitude of that impact even over the long-term. We are though working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to\npossibly offer new regulation compliance solutions that do not require a license, these products, they may become available in the next coming months.

At the core of it, what's really exciting is that, what was\nlargely a retrieval based computing approach, almost everything that you do is retrieved off of storage somewhere, has been augmented now, added with a\ngenerative method. And it's changed almost everything. You could see that text-to-text, text-to-image, text-to-video, text-to-3D, text-to-protein, text-to-chemicals,\nthese were things that were processed and typed in by humans in the past. And these are now generative approaches. The way that we access data is changed.\nIt used to be based on explicit queries. It is now based on natural language queries, intention queries, semantic queries. And so, we're excited about the work that\nwe're doing with SAP and Dropbox and many others that you're going to hear about. And one of the areas that is really impactful is the software industry, which is\nabout $1 trillion or so, has been building tools that are manually used over the last couple of decades. And now there's a whole new segment of software called\ncopilots and assistants. Instead of manually used, these tools will have copilots to help you use it. And so, instead of licensing software, we will continue to do\nthat, of course, but we will also hire copilots and assistants to help us use these -- use the software. We'll connect all of these copilots and assistants into teams\nof AIs, which is going to be the modern version of software, modern version of enterprise business software. And so the transformation of software and the way\nthat software has done is driving the hardware underneath. And you can see that it's transforming hardware in two ways. One is something that's largely\nindependent of generative AI. There's two trends: one is related to accelerated computing, general purpose computing is too wasteful of energy and cost. And\nnow that we have much, much better approaches, call it, accelerated computing, you could save an order of magnitude of energy, you can save an order of\nmagnitude of time or you can save an order of magnitudes of cost by using acceleration. And so, accelerated computing is transitioning, if you will, general\npurpose computing into this new approach. And that's been augmented by a new class of data centers. This is the traditional data centers that you were just\ntalking about where we represent about a third of that. But there is a new class of data centers and this new class of data centers, unlike the data centers of the\npast, where you have a lot of applications running used by a great many people that are different tenants that are using the same infrastructure and that data\ncenter stores a lot of files. These new data centers are very few applications, if not one application, used by basically one tenant and it processes data, it trains\nmodels and then generates tokens and generates AI. And we call these new data centers AI factories. We're seeing AI factories being built out everywhere, and\njust by every country. And so if you look at the way where we are in the expansion, the transition into this new computing approach, the first wave you saw with\nlarge language model start-ups, generative AI start-ups and consumer Internet companies, and weren't in the process of ramping that. Meanwhile, while that's\nbeing ramped, you see that we're starting to partner with enterprise software companies who would like to build chatbots and copilots and assistants to augment\nthe tools that they have on their platforms. You're seeing GPU specialized CSPs cropping up all over the world and they are dedicated to do really one thing,\nwhich is processing AI. You're seeing sovereign AI infrastructures, people -- countries that now recognize that they have to utilize their own data, keep their own\ndata, keep their own culture, process that data and develop their own AI. You see that in India. Several -- about a year ago in Sweden, you are seeing in Japan.\nLast week, a big announcement in France. But the number of sovereign AI clouds that are being built is really quite significant. And my guess is that almost every\nmajor region will have and surely every major country will have their own AI clouds. And so I think you're seeing just new developments as the generative AI wave\npropagates through every industry, every company, every region. And so we're at the beginning of this inflection, this computing transition.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo.

I'm curious of\nhow you see Ethernet involved evolving and maybe how you would characterize your differentiation of Spectrum-X relative to the traditional Ethernet stack as we\nstart to think about that becoming part of the networking narrative above and maybe beyond just InfiniBand as we look into next year?

Thanks for the question. Our networking business is already on a $10 billion plus run rate and it's going to get much larger. And as you mentioned, we \nadded a new networking platform to our networking business recently. The vast majority of the dedicated large scale AI factories standardize on InfiniBand. And \nthe reason for that is not only because of its data rate and not only just the latency, but the way that it moves traffic around the network is really important. The \nway that you process AI and a multi-tenant hyperscale Ethernet environment, the traffic pattern is just radically different. And with InfiniBand and with software \ndefined networks, we could do congestion control, adaptive routing, performance isolation and noise isolation, not to mention, of course, the day rate and the low \nlatency that -- and a very low overhead of InfiniBand that's natural part of InfiniBand. And so, InfiniBand is not so much just the network, it's also a computing \nfabric. We've put a lot of software-defined capabilities into the fabric including computation. We will do 40-point calculations and computation right on the switch, \nand right in the fabric itself. And so that's the reason why that difference in Ethernet versus InfiniBand or InfiniBand versus Ethernet for AI factories is so dramatic. \nAnd the difference is profound. And the reason for that is because you've just invested in a $2 billion infrastructure for AI factories. A 20%, 25%, 30% difference in \noverall effectiveness, especially as you scale up is measured in hundreds of millions of dollars of value. And if you will, renting that infrastructure over the course \nof four to five years, it really, really adds up. And so InfiniBand's value proposition is undeniable for AI factories. However, as we move AI into enterprise. This is \nenterprise computing what we'd like to enable every company to be able to build their own custom AIs. We're building customer AIs in our company based on our \nproprietary data, our proprietary type of skills. For example, recently we spoke about one of the models that we're creating, it's called ChipNeMo; we're building \nmany others. There'll be tens, hundreds of custom AI models that we create inside our company. And our company is -- for all of our employee use, doesn't have \nto be as high performance as the AI factories we used to train the models. And so we would like the AI to be able to run in Ethernet environment. And so what \nwe've done is we invented this new platform that extends Ethernet; doesn't replace Ethernet, it's 100% compliant with Ethernet. And it's optimized for East-West\n\ntraffic, which is where the computing fabric is. It adds to Ethernet with an end-to-end solution with Bluefield, as well as our Spectrum switch that allows us to\nperform some of the capabilities that we have in InfiniBand, not all but some. And we achieved excellent results. And the way we go to market is we go to market\nwith our large enterprise partners who already offer our computing solution. And so, HP, Dell and Lenovo has the NVIDIA AI stack, the NVIDIA AI Enterprise\nsoftware stack and now they integrate with Bluefield, as well as bundle -- take a market there, Spectrum switch, and they'll be able to offer enterprise customers\nall over the world with their vast sales force and vast network of resellers a fully integrated, if you will, fully optimized, at least end-to-end AI solution. And so that's\nbasically it, bringing AI to Ethernet for the world's enterprise.\nOperator\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley.

And you can also have applications or generative models where the context length is very high. You basically store it in entire book into end-to-end system\nmemory before you ask your questions. And so the context length can be quite large this way. The generative models has the ability to still be able to naturally\ninteract with you on one hand. On the other hand, be able to refer to factual data, proprietary data or domain-specific data, you data and be contextually relevant\nand reduce hallucination. And so that particular use case for example is really quite fantastic for Grace Hopper. It also serves the customers that really care to\nhave a different CPU than x86. Maybe it's a European supercomputing centers or European companies who would like to build up their own ARM ecosystem and\nlike to build up a full stack or CSPs that have decided that they would like to pivot to ARM, because their own custom CPUs are based on ARM. There are variety\nof different reasons that drives the success of Grace Hopper, but we're off to a just an extraordinary start.

And there are, of course, several reasons for that. We are expanding our supply quite significantly.\nWe have already one of the broadest and largest and most capable supply chain in the world. Now, remember, people think that the GPU is a chip. But the HGX\nH100, the Hopper HGX has 35,000 parts, it weighs 70 pounds. Eight of the chips are Hopper. The other 35,000 are not. It is -- even its passive components are\nincredible. High voltage parts. High frequency parts. High current parts. It is a supercomputer, and therefore, the only way to test a supercomputer is with another\nsupercomputer. Even the manufacturing of it is complicated, the testing of it is complicated, the shipping of it complicated and installation is complicated. And so,\nevery aspect of our HGX supply chain is complicated. And the remarkable team that we have here has really scaled out the supply chain incredibly. Not to\nmention, all of our HGXs are connected with NVIDIA networking. And the networking, the transceivers, the mix, the cables, the switches, the amount of\ncomplexity there is just incredible. And so, I'm just -- first of all, I'm just super proud of the team for scaling up this incredible supply chain. We are absolutely world\nclass. But meanwhile, we're adding new customers and new products. So we have new supply. We have new customers, as I was mentioning earlier. Different\nregions are standing up GPU specialist clouds, sovereign AI clouds coming out from all over the world, as people realize that they can't afford to export their\ncountry's knowledge, their country's culture for somebody else to then resell AI back to them, they have to -- they should, they have the skills and surely with us in\ncombination, we can help them to do that build up their national AI. And so, the first thing that they have to do is, create their AI cloud, national AI cloud. You're\nalso seeing us now growing into enterprise. The enterprise market has two paths. One path -- or if I could say three paths. The first path, of course, just\noff-the-shelf AI. And there are of course Chat GPT, a fabulous off-the-shelf AI, there'll be others. There's also a proprietary AI, because software companies like\nServiceNow and SAP, there are many, many others that can't afford to have their company's intelligence be outsourced to somebody else. And they are about\nbuilding tools and on top of their tools they should build custom and proprietary and domain-specific copilots and assistants that they can then rent to their\ncustomer base. This is -- they're sitting on a goldmine, almost every major tools company in the world is sitting on a goldmine, and they recognize that they have\nto go build their own custom AIs. We have a new service called an AI foundry, where we leverage NVS (ph) capabilities to be able to serve them in that. And then\nthe next one is enterprises building their own custom AIs, their own custom chatbots, their own custom RAGs. And this capability is spreading all over the world.\nAnd the way that we're going to serve that marketplace is with the entire stacks of systems, which includes our compute, our networking and our switches,\nrunning our software stack called NVIDIA AI Enterprise, taking it through our market partners, HP, Dell, Lenovo, so on and so forth. And so we're just -- we're\nseeing the waves of generative AI starting from the start-ups and CSPs, moving to consumer Internet companies, moving to enterprise software platforms,\nmoving to enterprise companies. And then ultimately, one of the areas that you guys have seen us spend a lot of energy on has to do with industrial generative\nAI. This is where NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse comes together and that is a really, really exciting work. And so I think the -- we're at the beginning of a\nbasically across-the-board industrial transition to generative AI to accelerated computing. This is going to affect every company, every industry, every country.\n\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.

There is a glaring opportunity in the world for AI foundry, and it makes so much sense. First, every company has its core\nintelligence. It makes up our company. Our data, our domain expertise, in the case of many companies, we create tools, and most of the software companies in\nthe world are tool platforms, and those tools are used by people today. And in the future, it's going to be used by people augmented with a whole bunch of AIs\nthat we hire. And these platforms just got to go across the world and you'll see and we've only announced a few; SAP, ServiceNow, Dropbox, Getty, many others\nare coming. And the reason for that is because they have their own proprietary AI. They want their own proprietary AI. They can't afford to outsource their\nintelligence and handout their data, and handout their flywheel for other companies to build the AI for them. And so, they come to us. We have several things that\nare really essential in a foundry. Just as TSMC as a foundry, you have to have AI technology. And as you know, we have just an incredible depth of AI capability\n-- AI technology capability. And then second, you have to have the best practice known practice, the skills of processing data through the invention of AI models\nto create AIs that are guardrails, fine-tuned, so on and so forth, that are safe, so on and so forth. And the third thing is you need factories. And that's what DGX\nCloud is. Our AI models are called AI Foundations. Our process, if you will, our CAD system for creating AIs are called NeMo and they run on NVIDIA's factories\nwe call DGX Cloud. Our monetization model is that with each one of our partners they rent a sandbox on DGX Cloud, where we work together, they bring their\ndata, they bring their domain expertise, we bring our researchers and engineers, we help them build their custom AI. We help them make that custom AI\nincredible. Then that custom AI becomes theirs. And they deploy it on the runtime that is enterprise grade, enterprise optimized or outperformance optimized,\nruns across everything NVIDIA. We have a giant installed base in the cloud, on-prem, anywhere. And it's secure, securely patched, constantly patched and\noptimized and supported. And we call that NVIDIA AI Enterprise. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is $4,500 per GP per year, that's our business model. Our business model\nis basically a license. Our customers then with that basic license can build their monetization model on top of. In a lot of ways we're wholesale, they become\nretail. They could have a per -- they could have subscription license base, they could per instance or they could do per usage, there is a lot of different ways that\nthey could take a -- create their own business model, but ours is basically like a software license, like an operating system. And so our business model is help you\ncreate your custom models, you run those custom models on NVIDIA AI Enterprise. And it's off to a great start. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is going to be a very large\nbusiness for us.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research.

Inference is complicated. It's actually incredibly complicated. If you -- we this quarter announced one of the most exciting new engines, optimizing compilers\ncalled TensorRT-LLM. The reception has been incredible. You got to GitHub, it's been downloaded a ton, a whole lot of stars, integrated into stacks and\nframeworks all over the world, almost instantaneously. And there are several reasons for that, obviously. We could create TensorRT-LLM, because CUDA is\nprogrammable. If CUDA and our GPUs were not so programmable, it would really be hard for us to improve software stacks at the pace that we do.\nTensorRT-LLM, on the same GPU, without anybody touching anything, improves the performance by a factor of two. And then on top of that, of course, the pace\nof our innovation is so high. H200 increases it by another factor of two. And so, our inference performance, another way of saying inference cost, just reduced by\na factor of four within about a year's time. And so, that's really, really hard to keep up with. The reason why everybody likes our inference engine is because our\ninstalled base. We've been dedicated to our installed base for 20 years, 20-plus years. We have an installed base that is not only largest in every single cloud, it's\nin every available from every enterprise system maker, it's used by companies of just about every industry. And every -- anytime you see a NVIDIA GPU, it runs\nour stack. It's architecturally compatible, something we've been dedicated to for a very long time. We're very disciplined about it. We make it our, if you will,\narchitecture compatibility is job one. And that has conveyed to the world, the certainty of our platform stability. NVIDIA's platform stability certainty is the reason\nwhy everybody builds on us first and the reason why everybody optimizes on us first. All the engineering and all the work that you do, all the invention of\ntechnologies that you build on top of NVIDIA accrues to the -- and benefits everybody that uses our GPUs. And we have such a large installed base, large --\nmillions and millions of GPUs in cloud, 100 million GPUs from people\u2019s PCs just about every workstation in the world, and they all architecturally compatible. And\nso, if you are an inference platform and you're deploying an inference application, you are basically an application provider. And as a software application\nprovider, you're looking for large installed base. Data processing, before you could train a model, you have to curate the data, you have to dedupe the data,\nmaybe you have to augment the data with synthetic data. So, process the data, clean the data, align the data, normalize the data, all of that data is measured not\nin bytes or megabytes, it's measured in terabytes and petabytes. And the amount of data processing that you do before data engineering, before that you do\ntraining is quite significant. It could represent 30%, 40%, 50% of the amount of work that you ultimately do. And what you -- and ultimately creating a data driven\nmachine learning service. And so data processing is just a massive part. We accelerate Spark, we accelerate Python. One of the coolest things that we just did is\ncalled cuDF Pandas. Without one line of code, Pandas, which is the single most successful data science framework in the world. Pandas now is accelerated by\nNVIDIA CUDA. And just out-of-the box, without the line of code and so the acceleration is really quite terrific and people are just incredibly excited about it. And\nPandas was designed for one purpose and one purpose only, really data processing, it's for data science.

Boy, that's just really excellent. You just wrote NVIDIA's business plan, and so you described our strategy. First of all, there is a fundamental reason why\nwe accelerate our execution. And the reason for that is because it fundamentally drives down cost. When the combination of TensorRT-LLM and H200 reduce the\ncost for our customers for large model inference by a factor of four, and so that includes, of course, our speeds and feeds, but mostly it's because of our software,\nmostly the software benefits because of the architecture. And so we want to accelerate our roadmap for that reason. The second reason is to expand the reach of\ngenerative AI, the world's number of data center configurations -- this is kind of the amazing thing. NVIDIA is in every cloud, but not one cloud is the same.\nNVIDIA is working with every single cloud service provider and not one of the networking control plane, security posture is the same. Everybody's platform is\ndifferent and yet we're integrated into all of their stacks, all of their data centers and we work incredibly well with all of them. And not to mention, we then take the\nwhole thing and we create AI factories that are standalone. We take our platform, we can put them into supercomputers, we can put them into enterprise. Bringing\nAI to enterprise is something generative AI Enterprise something nobody's ever done before. And we're right now in the process of going to market with all of that.\nAnd so the complexity includes, of course, all the technologies and segments and the pace. It includes the fact that we are architecturally compatible across every\nsingle one of those. It includes all of the domain specific libraries that we create. The reason why every computer company, without thinking, can integrate\nNVIDIA into their roadmap and take it to market. And the reason for that is, because there is market demand for it. There is market demand in healthcare, there is\nmarket demand in manufacturing, there is market demand, of course, in AI, including financial services, in supercomputing and quantum computing. The list of\nmarkets and segments that we have domain specific libraries is incredibly broaden. And then finally, we have an end-to-end solution for data centers; InfiniBand\nnetworking, Ethernet networking, x86, ARM, just about every permutation combination of solutions -- technology solutions and software stacks provided. And that\ntranslates to having the largest number of ecosystem software developers; the largest ecosystem of system makers; the largest and broadest distribution\npartnership network; and ultimately, the greatest reach. And that takes -- surely that takes a lot of energy. But the thing that really holds it together, and this is a\ngreat decision that we made decades ago, which is everything is architecturally compatible. When we develop a domain specific language that runs on one GPU,\nit runs on every GPU. When we optimize TensorRT for the cloud, we optimized it for enterprise. When we do something that brings in a new feature, a new\nlibrary, a new feature or a new developer, they instantly get the benefit of all of our reach. And so that discipline, that architecture compatible discipline that has\nlasted more than a couple of decades now, is one of the reasons why NVIDIA is still really, really efficient. I mean, we're 28,000 people large and serving just\nabout every single company, every single industry, every single market around the world.\nOperator\nThank you.
