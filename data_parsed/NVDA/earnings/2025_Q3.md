## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Toshiya Hari (Goldman Sachs)**: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, you executed the mass change earlier this year. There were some reports over the
weekend about some heating issues. On the back of this, we've had investors ask about your ability to execute to the roadmap you presented at GTC this year
with Ultra coming out next year and the transition to [Ruben] (ph) in 2026. Can you sort of speak to that? And some investors are questioning that. So if you can
sort of speak to your ability to execute on time, that would be super helpful. And then a quick part B, on supply constraints, is it a multitude of componentry that's
causing this? Or is it specifically [HBM] (ph)? Is it supply constraints? Are the supply constraints getting better? Are they worsening? Any sort of color on that
would be super helpful as well. Thank you.

### Exchange 002

**Timothy Arcuri (UBS)**: Thanks a lot. I'm wondering if you can talk about the trajectory of how Blackwell is going to ramp this year. I know, Jensen, you did just talk about Blackwell being
better than I think you had said several billions of dollars in January. It sounds like you're going to do more than that. But I think in recent months also, you said
that Blackwell crosses over Hopper in the April quarter. So I guess I had two questions. First of all, is that still the right way to think about it that Blackwell will
crossover Hopper in April? And then Colette, you kind of talked about Blackwell bringing down gross margin to the low-70s as it ramps. So I guess if April is the
crossover, is that the worst of the pressure on gross margin? So you're going to be kind of in the low-70s as soon as April. I'm just wondering if you can sort of
shape that for us. Thanks.

**Colette Kress (CFO)**: Sure. Let me first start with your question, Tim. Thank you regarding our gross margins, and we discussed our gross margins as we are ramping Blackwell in the
very beginning and the many different configurations, the many different chips that we are bringing to market, we are going to focus on making sure we have the
best experience for our customers as they stand that up. We will start growing into our gross margins, but we do believe those will be in the low 70s in that first
part of the ramp. So you're correct, as you look at the quarters following after that, we will start increasing our gross margins and we hope to get to the mid-70s
quite quickly as part of that ramp.

### Exchange 003

**Vivek Arya (Bank of America)**: Thanks for taking my question. Colette, just to clarify, do you think it's a fair assumption to think NVIDIA could recover to kind of mid-70s gross margin in the back
half of calendar 2025? Just wanted to clarify that. And then, Jensen my main question historically, when we have seen hardware deployment cycles, they have
inevitably included some digestion along the way. When do you think we get to that phase, or is it just too premature to discuss that because you're just the start
of Blackwell? So how many quarters of shipments do you think is required to kind of satisfy this first wave? Can you continue to grow this into calendar 2026?
Just how should we be prepared to see what we have seen historically, right, the periods of digestion along the way of a long-term kind of secular hardware
deployment?

**Colette Kress (CFO)**: Okay. Vivek, thank you for the question. Let me clarify your question regarding gross margins. Could we reach the mid-70s in the second half of next year? And
yes, I think it is reasonable assumption or a goal for us to do, but we'll just have to see how that mix of ramp goes. But yes, it is definitely possible.

### Exchange 004

**Stacy Rasgon (Bernstein)**: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Colette, I had a clarification and a question for you. The clarification, just when you say low-70s gross margins, is 73.5
count as low-70s, or do you have something else in mind? And for my question, you're guiding total revenues and so I mean, total Data Center revenues in the
next quarter must be up quote-unquote several billion dollars, but it sounds like Blackwell now should be up more than that. But you also said Hopper was still
strong. So like is Hopper down sequentially next quarter? And if it is like why? Is it because of the supply constraints? Is China has been pretty strong is China is
kind of rolling off a bit into Q4. So any color you can give us on sort of the Blackwell ramp and the Blackwell versus Hopper behavior into Q4 would be really
helpful. Thank you.

**Colette Kress (CFO)**: So first starting on your first question there, Stacy, regarding our gross margin and defined low. Low, of course, is below the mid, and let's say we might be at
71%, maybe about 72%, 72.5%, we're going to be in that range. We could be higher than that as well. We're just going to have to see how it comes through. We
do want to make sure that we are ramping and continuing that improvement, the improvement in terms of our yields, the improvement in terms of the product as
we go through the rest of the year. So we'll get up to the mid-70s by that point. The second statement was a question regarding our Hopper and what is our
Hopper doing. We have seen substantial growth for our H200, not only in terms of orders but the quickness in terms of those that are standing that up. It is an
amazing product and it's the fastest-growing and ramping that we've seen. We will continue to be selling Hopper in this quarter, in Q4 for sure, that is
across-the-board in terms of all of our different configurations and our configurations include what we may do in terms of China. But keep that in mind that folks
are also at the same time looking to build out their Blackwell. So we've got a little bit of both happening in Q4. But yes, is it possible for Hopper to grow between
Q3 and Q4, it's possible, but we'll just have to see.

Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

### Exchange 005

**Joseph Moore (Morgan Stanley)**: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the inference market. You've talked about Strawberry and some of the
ramifications of longer scaling inference projects. But you've also talked about the possibility that as some of these Hopper clusters age that you could use some
of the Hopper latent chips for inference. So I guess, do you expect inference to outgrow training in the next kind of 12-month time frame, and just generally your
thoughts there?

### Exchange 006

**Aaron Rakers (Wells Fargo)**: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you as we kind of focus on the Blackwell cycle and think about the data center business. When I look at the
results this last quarter, Colette, you mentioned that obviously, the networking business was down about 15% sequentially, but then your comments were that you
were seeing very strong demand. You mentioned also that you had multiple cloud CSP design wins for these large-scale clusters. So I'm curious if you could
unpack what's going on in the networking business and where maybe you've seen some constraints and just your confidence in the pace of Spectrum-X
progressing to that multiple billions of dollars that you previously had talked about. Thank you.

**Colette Kress (CFO)**: Let's first start with the networking. The growth year-over-year is tremendous and our focus since the beginning of our acquisition of Mellanox has really been
about building together the work that we do in terms of -- in the Data Center. The networking is such a critical part of that. Our ability to sell our networking with
many of our systems that we are doing in data center is continuing to grow and do quite well. So this quarter is just a slight dip down and we're going to be right
back up in terms of growing. They're getting ready for Blackwell and more and more systems that will be using not only our existing networking but also the
networking that is going to be incorporated in a lot of these large systems that we are providing them to.
