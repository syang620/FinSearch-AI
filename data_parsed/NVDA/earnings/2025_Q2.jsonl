{"doc_id": "NVDA_2025_Q2", "ticker": "NVDA", "year": 2025, "quarter": 2, "filing_date": "2025-06-01", "phase": "qa", "speaker_name": "Colette Kress", "speaker_role": "CFO", "speaker_firm": null, "utterance_id": "u_0001", "utterance_type": "answer", "text": "Thanks, Stewart. Q2 was another record quarter. Revenue of $30 billion was up 15% sequentially and up 122% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $28 \nbillion. Starting with data center, data center revenue of $26.3 billion was a record, up 16% sequentially and up 154% year-on-year, driven by strong demand for \nNVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and our networking platforms. Compute revenue grew more than 2.5 times, networking revenue grew more than 2 times from \nthe last year. Cloud service providers represented roughly 45% for our data center revenue and more than 50% stemmed from the consumer, Internet, and \nenterprise companies. Customers continue to accelerate their Hopper architecture purchases, while gearing up to adopt Blackwell. Key workloads driving our \ndata center growth include generative AI, model training, and inferencing. Video, image, and text data pre and post-processing with CUDA and AI workloads, \nsynthetic data generation, AI-powered recommender systems, SQL, and vector database processing as well. Next-generation models will require 10 to 20 times \nmore compute to train with significantly more data. The trend is expected to continue. Over the trailing four quarters, we estimate that inference drove more than \n40% of our data center revenue. CSPs, consumer Internet companies, and enterprises benefit from the incredible throughput and efficiency of NVIDIA's inference \nplatform. Demand for NVIDIA is coming from frontier model makers, consumer Internet services, and tens of thousands of companies and startups building \ngenerative AI applications for consumers, advertising, education, enterprise and healthcare, and robotics. Developers desire NVIDIA's rich ecosystem and \navailability in every cloud. CSPs appreciate the broad adoption of NVIDIA and are growing their NVIDIA capacity given the high demand. NVIDIA H200 platform \nbegan ramping in Q2, shipping to large CSPs, consumer Internet, and enterprise company. The NVIDIA H200 builds upon the strength of our Hopper architecture \nand offering, over 40% more memory bandwidth compared to the H100. Our data center revenue in China grew sequentially in Q2 and is a significant contributor \nto our data center revenue. As a percentage of total data center revenue, it remains below levels seen prior to the imposition of export controls. We continue to \nexpect the China market to be very competitive going-forward. The latest round of MLPerf inference benchmarks highlighted NVIDIA's inference leadership with \nboth NVIDIA, Hopper, and Blackwell platforms combining to win gold medals on all tasks. At Computex, NVIDIA with the top computer manufacturers unveiled an \narray of Blackwell architecture-powered systems and NVIDIA networking for building AI factories and data centers. With the NVIDIA MGX modular reference \narchitecture, our OEMs and ODM partners are building more than 100 Blackwell-based systems designed quickly and cost-effectively. The NVIDIA Blackwell \nplatform brings together multiple GPU, CPU, DPU, NVLink, NVLink switch, and the networking chips systems, and NVIDIA CUDA software to power the \nnext-generation of AI across the cases, industries, and countries. The NVIDIA GB 200 NVL72 system with the fifth-generation NVLink enables all 72 GPUs to act \nas a single GPU and deliver up to 30 times faster inference for LLMs, workloads, and unlocking the ability to run trillion parameter models in real-time. Hopper \ndemand is strong and Blackwell is widely sampling. We executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mass to improve production yields. Blackwell production ramp is \nscheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal year '26. In Q4, we expect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue. Hopper shipments \nare expected to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025. Hopper supply and availability have improved. Demand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply, \nand we expect this to continue into next year. Networking revenue increased 16% sequentially. Our Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes our Spectrum-X \nend-to-end Ethernet platform, doubled sequentially with hundreds of customers adopting our Ethernet offerings. Spectrum-X has broad market support from OEM \nand ODM partners and is being adopted by CSPs, GPU cloud providers, and enterprise, including X-AI to connect the largest GPU compute cluster in the world. \nSpectrum-X supercharges Ethernet for AI processing and delivers 1.6 times the performance of traditional Ethernet. We plan to launch new Spectrum-X products \nevery year to support demand for scaling compute clusters from tens of thousands of DPUs today to millions of GPUs in the near future. Spectrum-X is well \non-track to begin a multi-billion dollar product line within a year. Our sovereign AI opportunities continue to expand as countries recognize AI expertise and \ninfrastructure at national imperatives for their society and industries. Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology is building its AI \nbridging cloud infrastructure 3.0 supercomputer with NVIDIA. We believe sovereign AI revenue will reach low-double-digit billions this year. The enterprise AI \nwave has started. Enterprises also drove sequential revenue growth in the quarter. We are working with most of the Fortune 100 companies on AI initiatives \nacross industries and geographies. A range of applications are fueling our growth, including AI-powered chatbots, generative AI copilots, and agents to build new \nmonetizable business applications and enhance employee productivity. Amdocs is using NVIDIA generative AI for their smart agent, transforming the customer \nexperience and reducing customer service costs by 30%. ServiceNow is using NVIDIA for its Now Assist offering, the fastest-growing new product in the \ncompany's history. SAP is using NVIDIA to build dual Co-pilots. Cohesity is using NVIDIA to build their generative AI agent and lower generative AI development \ncosts. Snowflake serves over 3 billion queries a day for over 10,000 enterprise customers is working with NVIDIA to build Copilots. And lastly, Wistron is using \nNVIDIA AI Omniverse to reduce end-to-end cycle times for their factories by 50%. Automotive was a key growth driver for the quarter as every automaker \ndeveloping autonomous vehicle technology is using NVIDIA in their data centers. Automotive will drive multi-billion dollars in revenue across on-prem and cloud\n\nconsumption and will grow as next-generation AV models require significantly more compute. Healthcare is also on its way to being a multi-billion dollar business\nas AI revolutionizes medical imaging, surgical robots, patient care, electronic health record processing, and drug discovery. During the quarter, we announced a\nnew NVIDIA AI foundry service to supercharge generative AI for the world's enterprises with Meta's Llama 3.1, collection of models. This marks a watershed\nmoment for enterprise AI. Companies for the first time can leverage the capabilities of an open-source frontier-level model to develop customized AI applications\nto encode their institutional knowledge into an AI flywheel to automate and accelerate their business. Accenture is the first to adopt the new service to build\ncustom Llama 3.1 models for both its own use and to assist clients seeking to deploy generative AI applications. Nvidia NIM accelerate and simplify model\ndeployment. Companies across healthcare, energy, financial services, retail, transportation, and telecommunications are adopting NIMs, including Aramco,\nLowe's, and Uber. AT&T realized 70% cost savings and 8 times latency reduction after moving into NIMs for generative AI, call transcription, and classification.\nOver 150 partners are embedding NIMs across every layer of the AI ecosystem. We announced NIM agent Blueprints, a catalog of customizable reference\napplications that include a full suite of software for building and deploying enterprise generative AI applications. With NIM agent blueprints, enterprises can refine\ntheir AI applications overtime, creating a data-driven AI flywheel. The first NIM agent blueprints include workloads for customer service, computer-aided drug\ndiscovery, and enterprise retrieval augmented generation. Our system integrators, technology solution providers, and system builders are bringing NVIDIA NIM\nagent blueprints to enterprises. NVIDIA NIM and NIM agent blueprints are available through the NVIDIA AI enterprise software platform, which has great\nmomentum. We expect our software, SaaS and support revenue to approach a $2 billion annual run rate exiting this year, with NVIDIA AI Enterprise notably\ncontributing to growth. Moving to gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $2.88 billion increased 9% sequentially and 16% year-on-year. We saw sequential\ngrowth in console, notebook, and desktop revenue and demand is strong and growing and channel inventory remains healthy. Every PC with RTX is an AIPC.\nRTX PCs can deliver up to 1,300 AI tops and there are now over 200 RTX AI laptops designs from leading PC manufacturers. With 600 AI-powered applications\nand games and an installed base of 100 million devices, RTX is set to revolutionize consumer experiences with generative AI. NVIDIA ACE, a suite of generative\nAI technologies is available for RTX, AI PCs. Mecha BREAK is the first game to use NVIDIA ACE, including our small large -- small language model, Minitron-4B\noptimized on device inference. The NVIDIA gaming ecosystem continues to grow, recently added RTX and DLSS titles including Indiana Jones and the Great\nCircle, Dune Awakening, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The GeForce NOW library continues to expand with total catalog size of over 2,000 titles, the most\ncontent of any cloud gaming service. Moving to Pro visualization. Revenue of $454 million was up 6% sequentially and 20% year-on-year. Demand is being\ndriven by AI and graphic use cases, including model fine-tuning and Omniverse-related workloads. Automotive and manufacturing were among the key industry\nverticals driving growth this quarter. Companies are racing to digitalize workflows to drive efficiency across their operations. The world's largest electronics\nmanufacturer, Foxconn is using NVIDIA Omniverse to power digital twins of the physical plants that produce NVIDIA Blackwell systems. And several large global\nenterprises, including Mercedes-Benz signed multi-year contracts for NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud to build industrial digital twins for factories. We announced new\nNVIDIA USD NIMs and connectors to open Omniverse to new industries and enable developers to incorporate generative AI Copilots and agents into USD\nworkflows, accelerating their ability to build highly accurate virtual worlds. WPP is implementing USD NIM microservices in its generative AI-enabled content\ncreation pipeline for customers such as the Coca-Cola company. Moving to automotive and robotics, revenue was $346 million, up 5% sequentially and up 37%\nyear-on-year. Year-on-year growth was driven by the new customer ramps in self-driving platforms and increased demand for AI cockpit solutions. At the\nconsumer -- at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference, NVIDIA won the Autonomous Brand Challenge in the end-to-end driving at-scale\ncategory, outperforming more than 400 entries worldwide. Austin Dynamics, BYD Electronics, Figure, Intrinsic, Siemens, Skilled ADI, and Teradyne Robotics are\nusing the NVIDIA Isaac Robotics platform for autonomous robot arms, humanoids, and mobile robots. Now moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins\nwere 75.1% and non-GAAP gross margins were 75.7%, down sequentially due to a higher mix of new products within data center and inventory provisions for\nlow-yielding Blackwell material. Sequentially, GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 12%, primarily reflecting higher compensation-related costs.\nCash flow from operations was $14.5 billion. In Q2, we utilized cash of $7.4 billion towards shareholder returns in the form of share repurchases and cash\ndividends, reflecting the increase in dividend per share. Our Board of Directors recently approved a $50 billion share repurchase authorization to add to our\nremaining $7.5 billion of authorization at the end of Q2. Let me turn the outlook for the third quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $32.5 billion, plus or minus\n2%. Our third-quarter revenue outlook incorporates continued growth of our Hopper architecture and sampling of our Blackwell products. We expect Blackwell\nproduction ramp in Q4. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.4% and 75%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. As our data center\nmix continues to shift to new products, we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. For the full-year, we expect gross margins to be in\nthe mid-70% range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.3 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. Full-year operating\nexpenses are expected to grow in the mid-to-upper 40% range as we work on developing our next generation of products. GAAP and non-GAAP other income\nand expenses are expected to be about $350 million, including gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities. GAAP and\nnon-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial detail are included in the CFO commentary and\nother information available on our IR website. We are now going to open the call for questions.

First of all, when I said ship production in Q4, I mean shipping out. I don't mean starting to ship, but I mean -- I don't mean starting production,\nbut shipping out. On the longer-term question, let's take a step-back and you've heard me say that we're going through two simultaneous platform transitions at\nthe same time. The first one is transitioning from accelerated computing to -- from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the reason for that\nis because CPU scaling has been known to be slowing for some time. And it is slow to a crawl. And yet the amount of computing demand continues to grow quite\nsignificantly. You could maybe even estimate it to be doubling every single year. And so if we don't have a new approach, computing inflation would be driving up\nthe cost for every company, and it would be driving up the energy consumption of data centers around the world. In fact, you're seeing that. And so the answer is\naccelerated computing. We know that accelerated computing, of course, speeds up applications. It also enables you to do computing at a much larger scale, for\nexample, scientific simulations or database processing. But what that translates directly to is lower cost and lower energy consumed. And in fact, this week,\nthere's a blog that came out that talked about a whole bunch of new libraries that we offer. And that's really the core of the first platform transition going from\ngeneral purpose computing to accelerated computing. And it's not unusual to see someone save 90% of their computing cost. And the reason for that is, of\ncourse, you just sped up an application 50x, you would expect the computing cost to decline quite significantly. The second was enabled by accelerated\ncomputing because we drove down the cost of training large language models or training deep learning so incredibly, that it is now possible to have gigantic scale\nmodels, multi-trillion parameter models, and train it on -- pre-train it on just about the world's knowledge corpus and let the model go figure out how to understand\na human represent -- human language representation and how to codify knowledge into its neural networks and how to learn reasoning, and so -- which caused\nthe generative AI revolution. Now generative AI, taking a step back about why it is that we went so deeply into it is because it's not just a feature, it's not just a\ncapability, it's a fundamental new way of doing software. Instead of human-engineered algorithms, we now have data. We tell the AI, we tell the model, we tell the\ncomputer what's the -- what are the expected answers, What are our previous observations. And then for it to figure out what the algorithm is, what's the function.\nIt learns a universal -- AI is a bit of a universal function approximator and it learns the function. And so you could learn the function of almost anything, you know.\nAnd anything that you have that's predictable, anything that has structure, anything that you have previous examples of. And so now here we are with generative\nAI. It's a fundamental new form of computer science. It's affecting how every layer of computing is done from CPU to GPU, from human-engineered algorithms to\nmachine-learned algorithms. And the type of applications you could now develop and produce is fundamentally remarkable. And there are several things that are\nhappening in generative AI. So the first thing that's happening is the frontier models are growing in quite substantial scale. And they're still seeing -- we're still all\nseeing the benefits of scaling. And whenever you double the size of a model, you also have to more than double the size of the dataset to go train it. And so the\namount of flops necessary in order to create that model goes up quadratically. And so it's not unusual -- it's not unexpected to see that the next-generation\nmodels could take 20 -- 10, 20, 40 times more compute than last generation. So we have to continue to drive the generational performance up quite significantly,\nso we can drive down the energy consumed and drive down the cost necessary to do it. So the first one is, there are larger frontier models trained on more\nmodalities and surprisingly, there are more frontier model makers than last year. And so you have more on more on more. That's one of the dynamics going on in\ngenerative AI. The second is although it's below the tip of the iceberg. What we see are ChatGPT, image generators, we see coding. We use a generative AI for\ncoding quite extensively here at NVIDIA now. We, of course, have a lot of digital designers and things like that. But those are kind of the tip of the iceberg. What's\nbelow the iceberg are the largest systems -- largest computing systems in the world today, which are -- and you've heard me talk about this in the past, which are\nrecommender systems moving from CPUs, it's now moving from CPUs to generative AI. So recommended systems, ad generation, custom ad generation\ntargeting ads at very large scale and quite hyper targeting search and user-generated content. These are all very large-scale applications have now evolved to\ngenerative AI. Of course, the number of generative AI startups is generating tens of billions of dollars of cloud renting opportunities for our cloud partners and\nsovereign AI. Countries that are now realizing that their data is their natural and national resource and they have to use -- they have to use AI, build their own AI\ninfrastructure so that they could have their own digital intelligence. Enterprise AI, as Colette mentioned earlier, is starting and you might have seen our\nannouncement that the world's leading IT companies are joining us to take the NVIDIA AI enterprise platform to the world's enterprises. The companies that we're\ntalking to. So many of them are just so incredibly excited to drive more productivity out of their company. And then I -- and then General Robotics. The big\ntransformation last year as we are able to now learn physical AI from watching video and human demonstration and synthetic data generation from reinforcement\nlearning from systems like Omniverse. We are now able to work with just about every robotics companies now to start thinking about start building on general\nrobotics. And so you can see that there are just so many different directions that generative AI is going. And so we're actually seeing the momentum of generative\nAI accelerating.", "char_count": 6425, "word_count": 1098, "token_count": 1342, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

Thanks, Joe. The demand for Hopper is really strong and it's true. The demand for Blackwell is incredible. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first\nreason is, if you just look at the world's cloud service providers and the amount of GPU capacity they have available, it's basically none. And the reason for that is\nbecause they're either being deployed internally for accelerating their own workloads, data processing, for example. Data processing, we hardly ever talk about it\nbecause it's mundane. It's not very cool because it doesn't generate a picture or generate words, but almost every single company in the world processes data in\nthe background. And NVIDIA's GPUs are the only accelerators on the planet that process and accelerate data. SQL data, Pandas data science, toolkits like\nPandas and the new one, Polars, these are the most popular data processing platforms in the world. And aside from CPUs, which as I've mentioned before, really\nrunning out of steam, Nvidia's accelerated computing is really the only way to get boosting performance out of that. And so that's number one is the primary -- the\nnumber one use-case long before generative AI came along is the migration of applications one after another to accelerated computing. The second is, of course,\nthe rentals. Their renting capacity to model makers or renting it to startup companies and a generative AI company spends the vast majority of their invested\ncapital into infrastructure so that they could use an AI to help them create products. And so these companies need it now. They just simply can't afford -- you just\nraise money, you -- they want you to put it to use now. You have processing that you have to do. You can't do it next year, you got to do it today. And so there's a\nfair -- that's one reason. The second reason for Hopper demand right now is because of the race to the next plateau. So the first person to the next plateau, it\ngets to be -- gets to introduce a revolutionary level of AI. So the second person who gets there is incrementally better or about the same. And so the ability to\nsystematically and consistently race to the next plateau and be the first one there, is how you establish leadership. NVIDIA is constantly doing that and we show\nthat to the world and the GPUs we make and AI factories that we make, the networking systems that we make, the SOCs we create. I mean, we want to set the\npace. We want to be consistently the world's best. And that's the reason why, we drive ourselves so hard. And of course, we also want to see our dreams come\ntrue, and all of the capabilities that we imagine in the future, and the benefits that we can bring to society. We want to see all that come true. And so these model\nmakers are the same. They're -- of course, they want to be the world's best, they want to be the world's first. And although Blackwell will start shipping out in\nbillions of dollars at the end of this year, the standing up of the capacity is still probably weeks and a month or so away. And so between now and then is a lot of\ngenerative AI market dynamic. And so everybody is just really in a hurry. It's either operational reasons that they need it, they need accelerated computing. They\ndon't want to build any more general-purpose computing infrastructure and even Hopper, you know, of course, H200 state-of-the-art. Hopper, if you have a choice\nbetween building CPU infrastructure right now for business or Hopper infrastructure for business right now, that decision is relatively clear.

The people who are investing in NVIDIA infrastructure are getting returns on it right away. It's the best ROI infrastructure -- computing infrastructure\ninvestment you can make today. And so one way to think through it, probably the most -- the easiest way to think through is just go back to first principles. You\nhave trillion dollars\u2019 worth of general-purpose computing infrastructure and the question is, do you want to build more of that or not? And for every $1 billion worth\nof general CPU-based infrastructure that you stand up, you probably rent it for less than $1 billion. And so because it's commoditized. There's already a trillion\ndollars on the ground. What's the point of getting more? And so the people who are clamoring to get this infrastructure, one, when they build-out Hopper-based\ninfrastructure and soon Blackwell-based infrastructure, they start saving money. That's tremendous return on investment. And the reason why they start saving\nmoney is because data processing saves money, data processing is pricing, just a giant part of it already. And so recommended system save money, so on and\nso forth, okay? And so you start saving money. The second thing is everything you stand-up are going to get rented because so many companies are being\nfounded to create generative AI. And so your capacity gets rented right away and the return on investment of that is really good. And then the third reason is your\nown business. Do you want to either create the next frontier yourself or your own Internet services benefit from a next-generation ad system or a next-generation\nrecommended system or next-generation search system? So for your own services, for your own stores, for your own user-generated content, social media\nplatforms for your own services, generative AI is also a fast ROI. And so there's a lot of ways you could think through it. But at the core, it's because it is the best\ncomputing infrastructure you could put in the ground today. The world of general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing. The world of\nhuman-engineered software is moving to generative AI software. If you were to build infrastructure to modernize your cloud and your data centers, build it with\naccelerated computing NVIDIA.

I really appreciate the question, Tim. So remember, the world is moving from general purpose computing to accelerated computing.\nAnd the world builds about $1 trillion dollars\u2019 worth of data centers -- $1 trillion dollars\u2019 worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing. In\nthe past, no GPUs are in data centers, just CPUs. In the future, every single data center will have GPUs. And the reason for that is very clear is because we need\nto accelerate workloads so that we can continue to be sustainable, continue to drive down the cost of computing so that when we do more computing our -- we\ndon't experience computing inflation. Second, we need GPUs for a new computing model called generative AI that we can all acknowledge is going to be quite\ntransformative to the future of computing. And so I think working backwards, the way to think about that is the next trillion dollars of the world's infrastructure will\nclearly be different than the last trillion, and it will be vastly accelerated. With respect to the shape of our ramp, we offer multiple configurations of Blackwell.\nBlackwell comes in either a Blackwell classic, if you will, that uses the HGX form factor that we pioneered with Volta, and I think it was Volta. And so we've been\nshipping the HGX form factor for some time. It is air-cooled. The Grace Blackwell is liquid-cooled. However, the number of data centers that want to go\nliquid-cooled is quite significant. And the reason for that is because we can in a liquid-cooled data center, in any data center -- power limited data center,\nwhatever size data center you choose, you could install and deploy anywhere from 3 times to 5 times, the AI throughput compared to the past. And so liquid\ncooling is cheaper, liquid cooling TCO is better, and liquid cooling allows you to have the benefit of this capability we call NVLink , which allows us to expand it to\n72 Grace Blackwell packages, which has essentially 144 GPUs. And so imagine 144 GPUs connected in NVLink and that is -- we're increasingly showing you the\nbenefits of that. And the next click is obviously a very low-latency, very-high throughput, large language model inference. And the large domain is going to be a\ngame-changer for that. And so I think people are very comfortable deploying both. And so almost every CSP we're working with are deploying some of both. And\nso I -- I'm pretty confident that we'll ramp it up just fine. Your second question out of the third is that looking-forward, yes, next year is going to be a great year. We\nexpect to grow our data center business quite significantly next year. Blackwell is going to be going to be a complete game-changer for the industry. And\nBlackwell is going to carry into the following year. And as I mentioned earlier, working backwards from first principles. Remember that computing is going through\ntwo platform transitions at the same time and that's just really, really important to keep your head on -- your mind focused on, which is general-purpose computing\nis shifting to accelerated computing and human engineered software is going to transition to generative AI or artificial intelligence learned software.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.

So let's say Hopper there for versus H1 is a growth opportunity for that. Additionally, we have the Blackwell on top of that, and\nthe Blackwell starting of -- ramping in Q4. So hope that helps you on those two pieces. Your second piece is in terms of on our gross margin. We provided gross\nmargin for our Q3. We provided our gross margin on a non-GAAP at about 75%. We'll work with all the different transitions that we're going through, but we do\nbelieve we can do that 75% in Q3. We provided that we're still on track for the full-year also in the mid-70s or approximately the 75%. So we're going to see some\nslight difference possibly in Q4.

Let's see. I think the first answer to your -- the answer to your first question is that the reason why our velocity is so high is simultaneously because,\nthe complexity of the model is growing and we want to continue to drive its cost down. It's growing, so we want to continue to increase its scale. And we believe\nthat by continuing to scale the AI models that will reach a level of extraordinary usefulness and that it would open up, I realize the next industrial revolution. We\nbelieve it. And so we're going to drive ourselves really hard to continue to go up that scale. We have the ability fairly uniquely to integrate -- to design an AI factory\nbecause we have all the parts. It's not possible to come up with a new AI factory every year, unless you have all the parts. And so we have -- next year, we're\ngoing to ship a lot more CPUs than we've ever had in the history of our company, more GPUs, of course, but also NVLink switches, CX DPUs, ConnectX EPU for\nEast and West, Bluefield DPUs for North and South and data and storage processing to InfiniBand for supercomputing centers to Ethernet, which is a brand-new\nproduct for us, which is well on its way to becoming a multi-billion dollar business to bring AI to Ethernet. And so the fact that we could build -- we have access to\nall of this. We have one architectural stack, as you know. It allows us to introduce new capabilities to the market as we complete it. Otherwise, what happens is,\nyou ship these parts, you go find customers to sell it to and then you've got to build -- somebody has got to build up an AI factory. And the AI factory has got a\nmountain of software. And so it's not about who integrates it. We love the fact that our supply chain is disintegrated in the sense that we could service Quanta,\nFoxconn, HP, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro. We used to be able to serve as ZT. They were recently purchased and so on and so forth. And so the number of\necosystem partners that we have, Gigabyte, ASUS, the number of ecosystem partners that we have that allows us allows us to -- allows them to take our\narchitecture, which all works, but integrated in a bespoke way into all of the world's cloud service providers, enterprise data centers. The scale and reach\nnecessary from our ODMs and our integrator supply-chain is vast and gigantic because the world is huge. And so that part we don't want to do and we're not\ngood at doing. And I -- but we know how to design the AI infrastructure, provided the way that customers would like it and lets the ecosystem integrate it. Well,\nyes.

The Blackwell Rack system, it's designed and architected as a rack, but it's sold, in a disaggregated system components. We don't sell the\nwhole rack. And the reason for that is because everybody's rack is a little different, surprisingly. You know, some of them are OCP standards, some of them are\nnot, some of them are enterprise, and the power limits for everybody could be a little different. Choice of CDUs, the choice of power bus bars, the configuration\nand integration into people's data centers, all different. And so the way we designed it, we architected the whole rack. The software is going to work perfectly\nacross the whole rack. And then we provide the system components, like for example, the CPU and GPU compute board is then integrated into an MGX, it's a\nmodular system architecture. MGX is completely ingenious. And we have MGX ODMs and integrators and OEMs all over the plant. And so just about any\nconfiguration you would like, where you would like that 3,000 pound rack to be delivered. It's got to be close to -- it has to be integrated and assembled close to\nthe data center because it's fairly heavy. And so everything from the supply chain from the moment that we ship the GPU, CPUs, the switches, the NICs. From\nthat point forward, the integration is done quite close to the location of the CSPs and the locations of the data centers. And so you can imagine how many data\ncenters in the world there are and how many logistics hubs, we've scaled out to with our ODM partners. And so I think that because we show it as one rack and\nbecause it's always rendered that way and shown that way, we might have left the impression that we're doing the integration. Our customers hate that we do\nintegration. The supply-chain hates us doing integration. They want to do the integration. That's their value-added. There's a final design in, if you will. It's not\nquite as simple as shimmy into a data center, but the design fit in is really complicated. And so the install -- the design fit-in, the installation, the bring-up, the\nrepair and replace, that entire cycle is done all over the world. And we have a sprawling network of ODM and OEM partners that does this incredibly well. So\nintegration is not the reason why we're doing racks. It's the anti-reason of doing it.

Let me make a couple more -- make a couple of comments that I made earlier again. That data center worldwide are in full steam to modernize the \nentire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI. Hopper demand remains strong and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible. Let me \nhighlight the top-five things, the top-five things of our company. Accelerated computing has reached a tipping point, CPU scaling slows, developers must \naccelerate everything possible. Accelerated computing starts with CUDA-X libraries. New libraries open new markets for NVIDIA. We released many new \nlibraries, including accelerated Polars, Pandas, and Spark, the leading data science and data processing libraries, QVS for vector product vector databases. This \nis incredibly hot right now. Aerial and Sionna for 5G wireless base station, a whole suite of -- a whole world of data centers that we can go into now. Parabricks for \ngene sequencing and Alpha-fold two for protein structure prediction is now CUDA accelerated. We are at the beginning of our journey to modernize a $1 trillion\n\ndollars\u2019 worth of data centers from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. That's number-one. Number two, Blackwell is a step-function leap over\nHopper. Blackwell is an AI infrastructure platform, not just a GPU. It also happens to be in the name of our GPU, but it's an AI infrastructure platform. As we\nreveal more of Blackwell and sample systems to our partners and customers, the extent of Blackwell's lead becomes clear. The Blackwell Vision took nearly five\nyears and seven one-of-a-kind chips to realize. The Grace CPU, the Blackwell dual GPU, and a coVS package, ConnectX DPU for East-West traffic, BlueField\nDPU for North-South and storage traffic, NVLink switch for all-to-all GPU communications, and Quantum and Spectrum-X for both InfiniBand and Ethernet can\nsupport the massive burst traffic of AI. Blackwell AI factories are building-sized computers. NVIDIA designed and optimized the Blackwell platform full stack\nend-to-end from chips, systems, networking, even structured cables, power and cooling, and mounts of software to make it fast for customers to build AI factories.\nThese are very capital-intensive infrastructures. Customers want to deploy it as soon as they get their hands on the equipment and deliver the best performance\nand TCO. Blackwell provides 3 times to 5 times more AI throughput in a power-limited data center than Hopper. The third is NVLink. This is a very big deal with its\nall-to-all GPU switch is game-changing. The Blackwell system lets us connect 144 GPUs in 72-GB 200 packages into one NVLink domain, with an aggregate\nNVLink bandwidth of 259 terabytes per second in one rack. Just to put that in perspective, that's about 10 times higher than Hopper, 259 terabytes per second, it\nkind of makes sense because you need to boost the training of multi-trillion parameter models on trillions of tokens. And so that natural amount of data needs to\nbe moved around from GPU to GPU. For inference, NVLink is vital for low-latency, high-throughput, large language model, token generation. We now have three\nnetworking platforms, NVLink for GPU scale-up, Quantum InfiniBand for supercomputing and dedicated AI factories, and Spectrum-X for AI on Ethernet. NVIDIA's\nnetworking footprint is much bigger than before. Generative AI momentum is accelerating. Generative AI frontier model makers are racing to scale to the next AI\nplateau to increase model safety and IQ. We're also scaling to understand more modalities from text, images, and video to 3D, physics, chemistry, and biology.\nChatbots, coding AIs, and image generators are growing fast, but it's just the tip of the iceberg. Internet services are deploying generative AI for large-scale\nrecommenders, ad targeting, and search systems. AI start-ups are consuming tens of billions of dollars yearly of CSP's cloud capacity and countries are\nrecognizing the importance of AI and investing in sovereign AI infrastructure. And NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse is opening up the next era of AI general\nrobotics. And now the enterprise AI wave has started and we're poised to help companies transform their businesses. The NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform consists\nof NeMo, NIMS, NIM agent blueprints, and AI Foundry, that our ecosystem partners the world-leading IT companies used to help customer -- companies\ncustomize AI models and build bespoke AI applications. Enterprises can then deploy on NVIDIA AI Enterprise runtime and at $4,500 per GPU per year, NVIDIA\nAI Enterprise is an exceptional value for deploying AI anywhere. And for NVIDIA's software TAM can be significant as the CUDA-compatible GPU installed-base\ngrows from millions to tens of millions. And as Colette mentioned, NVIDIA software will exit the year at a $2 billion run rate.
