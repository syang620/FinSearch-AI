## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Toshiya Hari (Goldman Sachs)**: Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question and congratulations on the really strong results. My question is for Jen-Hsun on the data center business. Clearly, 
you're doing extremely well in the business. I'm curious how your expectations for calendar '24 and '25 have evolved over the past 90 days. And as you answer

the question, I was hoping you can touch on some of the newer buckets within data center, things like software. Sovereign AI, I think you've been pretty vocal
about how to think about that medium-to-long term. And recently, there was an article about NVIDIA potentially participating in the ASIC market. Is there any
credence to that, and if so, how should we think about you guys playing in that market over the next several years? Thank you.

### Exchange 002

**Toshiya Hari (Goldman Sachs)**: I guess your expectations for data center, how they've evolved. Thank you.

### Exchange 003

**Joe Moore (Morgan Stanley)**: Great. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the 40% of revenues coming from inference. That's a bigger number than I expected. Can you give us some sense of
where that number was maybe a year before, how much you're seeing growth around LLMs from inference? And how are you measuring that? Is that -- I assume
it's in some cases the same GPUs you use for training and inference. How solid is that measurement? Thank you.

### Exchange 004

**Stacy Rasgon (Bernstein)**: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted Colette -- I wanted to touch on your comment that you expected the next generation of products -- I assume
that meant Blackwell, to be supply constrained. Could you dig into that a little bit, what is the driver of that? Why does that get constrained as Hopper is easing
up? And how long do you expect that to be constrained, like do you expect the next generation to be constrained like all the way through calendar '25, like when
do those start to ease?

### Exchange 005

**Matt Ramsay (Cowen)**: Good afternoon, Jensen, Colette. Congrats on the results. I wanted to ask I guess a two-part question, and it comes at what Stacy was just getting out on your
demand being significantly more than your supply, even though supply is improving. And I guess the two sides of the question are, I guess, first for Colette, like
how are you guys thinking about allocation of product in terms of customer readiness to deploy and sort of monitoring if there's any kind of build-up of product that
might not yet be turned on? And then I guess Jen-Hsun, for you, I'd be really interested to hear you speak a bit about the thought that you and your company are
putting into the allocation of your product across customers, many of which compete with each other, across industries to smaller startup companies, to things in
the healthcare arena to government. It's a very, very unique technology that you're enabling and I'd be really interested to hear you speak a bit about how you
think about quote/unquote fairly allocating sort of for the good of your company, but also for the good of the industry. Thanks.

**Colette Kress (CFO)**: Let me first start with your question, thanks, about how we are working with our customers as they look into how they are building out their GPU instances and
our allocation process. The folks that we work with, our customers that we work with, have been partners with us for many years as we have been assisting them
both in what they set up in the cloud, as well as what they are setting up internally. Many of these providers have multiple products going at one time to serve so
many different needs across their end customers but also what they need internally. So they are working in advance, of course, thinking about those new clusters
that they will need. And our discussions with them continue not only on our Hopper architecture, but helping them understand the next wave and getting their
interest and getting their outlook for the demand that they want. So it's always a moving process in terms of what they will purchase, what is still being built and
what is in use for our end customers. But the relationships that we've built and their understanding of the sophistication of the build has really helped us with that
allocation and both helped us with our communications with them.

### Exchange 006

**Timothy Arcuri (UBS)**: Thanks a lot. I wanted to ask about how you're converting backlog into revenue. Obviously, lead times for your products have come down quite a bit. Colette, you
didn't talk about the inventory purchase commitments. But if I sort of add up your inventory plus the purchase commits and your prepaid supply, sort of the
aggregate of your supply, it was actually down a touch. How should we read that? Is that just you saying that you don't need to make as much of a financial
commitment to your suppliers because the lead times are lower or is that maybe you're reaching some sort of steady state where you're closer to filling your order
book and your backlog? Thanks.

**Colette Kress (CFO)**: Yeah. So let me, highlight on those three different areas of how we look at our suppliers. You're correct. Our inventory on hand given our allocation that we're on,
we're trying to, as things come into inventory, immediately work to ship them to our customers. I think our customer appreciates our ability to meet the schedules
that we've looked for. The second piece of it is our purchase commitments. Our purchase commitments have many different components into it, components that
we need for manufacturing. But also, often we are procuring capacity that we may need. The length of that need for capacity or the length for the components are
all different. Some of them may be for the next two quarters, but some of them may be for multiple years. I can say the same regarding our prepaids. Our
prepaids are pre-designed to make sure that we have the reserve capacity that we need at several of our manufacturing suppliers as we look forward. So
wouldn't read into anything regarding approximately about the same numbers as we are increasing our supply. All of them just have different lengths as we have
sometimes had to buy things in long-lead times or things that needed capacity to be built for us.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research. Your line is open.

### Exchange 007

**Aaron Rakers (Wells Fargo)**: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the China business. I know that in your prepared comments you said that you started shipping some
alternative solutions into China. You also put it out that you expect that contribution to continue to be about a mid-single digit percent of your total data center
business. So I guess the question is what is the extent of products that you're shipping today into the China market and why should we not expect that maybe
other alternative solutions come to the market and expand your breadth to participate in that in that opportunity again? Thank you.

### Exchange 008

**Harsh Kumar (Piper Sandler)**: Yeah. Hey, Jen-Hsun, Colette and NVIDIA team. First of all, congratulations on a stunning quarter and guide. I wanted to talk about, a little bit about your software
business and it's pleasing to hear that it's over a $1 billion but I was hoping Jen-Hsun or Colette if you could just help us understand what the different parts and
pieces are for the software business? In other words, just help us unpack it a little bit, so we can get a better understanding of where that growth is coming from.
