Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Before I talk about our results I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the \ndevastating wildfires that impacted the Los Angeles area this month. From our retail teams to Apple TV+, Apple Music, Fitness Plus, Beats and more LA is home \nto many of our team members. Our thoughts are with everyone who is beginning the road to recovery. For our part, we are contributing to the relief efforts and we \nwill continue to support our teams and the local community. Now turning to the quarter. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $124.3 billion for the December \nquarter, up 4% from a year ago, and an all-time record. EPS also set an all-time record of $2.40, 10% higher year-over-year. We achieved all-time revenue \nrecords across the majority of the countries and regions we track, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia Pacific. We also continue to see \nmomentum in emerging markets, setting all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia, among \nothers. In services, we achieved an all-time revenue record, and in the past year, we've seen nearly $100 billion in revenue from our services business. I'm also \npleased to announce that we reached a new record for our installed base with over 2.35 billion active devices. In October, we released the first set of Apple \nIntelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and we rolled out more features and expanded to more countries in December. Now users can \ndiscover the benefits of these new features in the things they do every day. They can use writing tools to help find just the right words, create fun and unique \nimages with Image Playground and Genmoji, handle daily tasks and seek out information with a more natural and conversational Siri, create movies of their \nmemories with a simple prompt, and touch up their photos with clean up. We introduced visual intelligence with camera control to help users instantly learn about \ntheir surroundings. Users can also seamlessly access chat GPT across iOS, iPadOS and MacOS. And we were excited to recently begin our international \nexpansion with Apple Intelligence now available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. We're working hard to take Apple Intelligence \neven further. In April, we're bringing Apple Intelligence to more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and \nsimplified Chinese, as well as localized English to Singapore and India. And we'll continue to roll out more features in the future, including an even more capable \nSiri. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovations we've made across hardware and software to transform how users experience our products. Apple \nIntelligence also empowers users by delivering personal context that's relevant to them. And importantly, Apple Intelligence is a breakthrough for privacy and AI \nwith innovations like Private Cloud Compute, which extends the industry-leading security and privacy of Apple devices into the cloud. Apple Intelligence opens up \nan exciting new frontier and is already elevating experiences across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. We're going to keep investing in innovation and in transformative \ntools that help users in their everyday lives. Let me now turn to our results for the quarter, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $69.1 billion, reaching \nall-time iPhone revenue records in dozens of markets and regions. Our iPhone 16 lineup takes the smartphone experience to the next level in so many ways, and \nApple Intelligence is one of many reasons why customers are excited. With the A18 powered iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, users are getting a big boost in \nbattery life and incredible camera experiences with camera control. Our amazingly powerful iPhone 16 Pro models go even further with larger-than-ever displays \nand a pro camera system so advanced it can turn moments into masterpieces. In Mac, revenue was $9 billion for the December quarter, 16% higher \nyear-over-year, driven by significant excitement around the world for our latest Mac lineup. The Mac is more than just a powerful tool. It's a launchpad to enable \nusers to bring their best ideas and boldest creations to life. And there are so many reasons to choose Mac, from the breathtaking performance of the M4 family of \nchips to the groundbreaking and growing capabilities of Apple Intelligence. Every product in the Mac lineup offers something extraordinary, whether that's the \nsuper portable MacBook Air, the powerhouse MacBook Pro, the world's best all-in-one iMac, or the small wonder that is the Mac Mini, which is not only stunningly \ncapable, but is our first carbon neutral Mac. All of this is enabled by the unparalleled power of Apple Silicon. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% from a year \nago, driven by strong interest for our latest products. We love hearing from customers, who are discovering for the first time the versatility of iPad from the \nultra-portal iPad Mini, built from the ground up for Apple intelligence, to the powerful M4 iPad Pro in a stunningly thin and light design. iPad is there for our users \nwhenever they need it and wherever they go and we are pleased to see so much excitement and enthusiasm for our lineup. Wearables home and accessories \nrevenue came in at $11.7 billion. With its most advanced display yet and a thinner more comfortable design, the all-new Apple Watch Series 10 is the perfect \ncompanion to help users pursue their health and fitness goals this year. From the powerful Vitals app to more customizable activity rings, users have an \never-increasing set of innovative health tools at their fingertips and watchOS 11. Health innovation has long been a focus for us, and we're committed to \ncontinuing to advance this work, because we know how much it matters to our users. We've introduced new hearing health features on AirPods Pro 2, and new \nsleep apnea notifications on Apple Watch are also helping users learn of a potentially serious condition that's thought to affect up to a billion people worldwide. \nDuring the quarter, we also brought Apple Vision Pro to even more countries, enabling more customers to discover the magic of spatial computing. Users are \nenjoying incredible immersive entertainment experiences and powerful new features and enhancements to Mac virtual display. Vision Pro is also supercharging \nthe creative process and the incredibly talented director John M. Chu recently shared how its extraordinary capabilities helped him bring the movie Wicked to life. \nTurning to services, we set an all-time revenue record of $26.3 billion for the December quarter, growing 14% from a year ago. We set all-time records in the \nAmericas, Europe, and rest of Asia-Pacific, and a December quarter record in Japan. Five years since launch, Apple TV+ continues to be home to incredible \nstorytelling that viewers love. There's nothing quite like the anticipation that comes when a fan favorite returns, and we were thrilled to debut the second season \nof Severance earlier this month. We have so much in store for our subscribers this year with new shows like The Studio and Your Friends and Neighbors. And we \ncan't wait for the premiere of Formula 1 starring Brad Pitt on June 27, which will take viewers inside the sport in a truly unprecedented way. We're excited that \nApple TV+ continues to draw attention and accolades. To-date, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins. During the \nquarter, we were also excited to launch a new Find My Service that can help our users when they lose their luggage. For the first time, if you put an air tag in your \nsuitcase, you'll be able to share its location information with many major airlines, so they can quickly track down your bags if they get lost. Turning to retail, our\n\nteams went above and beyond to help customers find the perfect gift throughout the holiday season. We also celebrated openings of new stores in China, Spain,\nand the U.S. and we were excited to announce plans to connect with even more customers this year by adding a fifth store in the UAE and bringing our online\nstore to Saudi Arabia this summer. We can't wait to welcome customers to the first of several flagship store locations in Saudi Arabia that were opening beginning\nin 2026. I just had the chance to visit both countries last month, and I had a great time meeting with customers and team members. There's an incredible energy\nand passion for technology in these growing markets. Every day, I get deeply moving notes about the many ways our technology is enriching our users' lives. I\nrecently got a note from a customer who put his watch on his father's wrist when he feared something was wrong with him. The watch alerted them that the father\nwas an AFib and they were able to get him to the hospital for potentially life-saving treatment. Another user put his new watch on for the first time and within 15\nminutes was notified of a low heart rate that led to a necessary pacemaker. And there are so many touching notes around the profound impact of our new hearing\nhealth feature like a recent user who told me it had changed her life, allowing her to take part in conversations with her children and grandchildren. These are the\nkind of stories that remind us of how profoundly important our work is, and it drives us to innovate each and every day. At Apple, the future is full of promise and\npotential. We're always searching across a world of possibilities, finding those places where we can do the most good and putting all of our energy and ingenuity\ninto making something special. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin.", "char_count": 9796, "word_count": 1633, "token_count": 2031, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

We achieved all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and rest\nof Asia Pacific and grew in the vast majority of markets we track. Products revenue was $98 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by growth from iPad and Mac.\nThanks to our incredible customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic\nsegments and is now over 2.35 billion active devices. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year. We grew in every\ngeographic segment and achieved all-time records in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.9% at the high-end of our guidance\nrange and up 70 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 39.3%, up 300 basis points sequentially, primarily driven\nby favorable mix and leverage. Services gross margin was 75%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix. Operating expenses of $15.4 billion\nlanded at the midpoint of our guidance range and up 7% year-over-year. This strong business performance resulted in all-time records for both net income at\n$36.3 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.40, up 10% year-over-year. Operating cash flow was also strong at $29.9 billion, which included the impact of\nthe $11.9 billion we paid during the quarter in connection with the state aid decision. Now, I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue\ncategories. iPhone revenue was $69.1 billion, roughly flat to the prior year. We grew in the majority of markets we track and reached all-time revenue records in\nseveral developed markets, including Canada, Western Europe, and Japan and in emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia. The\niPhone Active installed base grew to an all-time high in total in an average geographic segment. We also set an all-time record for upgraders. According to a\nrecent survey from Kantar during the December quarter, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, India, the U.K., France, Australia, and Japan.\nWe continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 96% as measured by 451 research. Mac generated $9 billion in revenue, up 16%\nyear-over-year. We saw strength across our lineup from the new Mac Mini to the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. This incredible performance was\nbroad-based with double-digit growth in every geographic segment. With our latest advances in Apple Silicon and our fastest neural engine ever, customers are\nable to take advantage of the full capabilities of AI and Mac. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high and we saw a double-digit growth for both upgraders\nand customers new to the Mac. Additionally, customer satisfaction in the U.S. was recently measured at 94%. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15%\nyear-over-year, driven by the new iPad Mini and latest iPad Air. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who\npurchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Customer satisfaction was at 96% in the U.S. based on the latest reports from 451 Research.\nWearable's home and accessories revenue was $11.7 billion, down 2% year-over-year. Customers are excited about the new AirPods 4 and the latest hearing\nhealth features in AirPods Pro 2. On watch, although we face a difficult compare against the watch Ultra 2 launch last year, the Apple Watch installed base\nreached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. Customer satisfaction for watch\nin the U.S. was reported at 94%. Our services revenue reached an all-time high of $26.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Services continues to see strong\nmomentum, and the growth of our installed base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future. We also see increased customer engagement with\nour services offerings. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Paid\nsubscriptions also grew double-digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform. We remain focused on improving the\nbreadth and quality of our services offerings, from new games on Apple Arcade to exciting new programming on Fitness Plus, and the continued expansion of\nfeatures like Tap to Pay, now live in 20 markets. Turning to enterprise, we have seen businesses continue to expand their deployments of our products and\nservices. Deutsche Bank launched its Mac as Choice program for the developers and also issued the latest MacBook Air as a standard computer for their entire\nmortgage lending division. And we're excited to see leading enterprises such as SAP leverage Apple Intelligence in the U.S., with features like writing tools,\nsummarize, and priority notifications to enhance both their employee and customer experiences. We also see strong demand in our emerging markets. For\nexample, Zomato, a leading food ordering and delivery company in India, has deployed 1,000 of Macs across their workforce to foster innovation. In Vision Pro\ncontinues to see more use cases in enterprise, with Cisco's new spatial meetings delivering a fully immersive video conferencing experience for remote\ncollaboration and learning. Let me quickly summarize our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $141 billion in cash and\nmarketable securities. We repaid $1 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8 billion, resulting in $97 billion in total debt. Therefore, net\ncash at the end of the quarter was $45 billion. During the quarter, we returned over $30 billion to shareholders. This included $3.9 billion in dividends and\nequivalents and $23.3 billion through open market repurchases of 100 million Apple shares. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program\nwhen we report results for the March quarter. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking\ninformation that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from\nwhat we're projecting today for the current quarter. As the dollar is strengthened significantly, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind and to have a\nnegative impact on revenue of about 2.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Despite that headwind, we expect our March quarter total company\nrevenue to grow low to mid-single-digits year-over-year. We expect services revenue to grow low-double-digits year-over-year. When you remove the negative\nimpact of the foreign exchange headwinds I described earlier, the year-over-year growth rate would be comparable to that of the December quarter. We expect\ngross margin to be between 46.5% and 47.5%. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.1 billion and $15.3 billion. We expect OI&E to be around\nnegative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our\nBoard of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on February 13, 2025, to shareholders of record as of February 10,\n2025.

But when I think about your kind of framework for the March quarter, if I kind of adjust for channel inventory over the\nlast couple of years, kind of, feels like your iPhone revenue for the March quarter is going to be relatively similar to the quarter two years ago and even the quarter\nlast year? So how do we square kind of the momentum versus kind of the iPhone business effectively really kind of unchanged over the last couple of years? And\nthen second, when I think about kind of the gross margin profile of the business, obviously, you've done a great job in taking gross margins up. Where do you\nthink we sit in terms of, on the services side at least, where margins could go? It looks like the 75% margin has been incredibly successful quarter.

And so I think, one, it's because of the nature of those businesses and in part also because of the way we account for them. And so one\nof the big factors that drive the Services gross margins and relative performance of those different businesses within the portfolio. We also have the dynamic of\nsome scale businesses like payment services, iCloud, that are actually growing. And there, when we add incremental users, those end up being accretive to\nmargins as well. And so in general, what we saw in the December quarter was nice momentum across our entire services business that allows us to deliver that\n75% margin at the services level.

That was really driven by, we talked about, favorable mix and leverage. As you know, in Q1, again, it's a launch quarter for many products, and so we\ntend to benefit from the leverage that we get from that higher volume. I would say, in general, our gross margin on products is driven by a number of factors. One\nof them is the various product launches that we have. Different products do have different margin profiles. And so that mix does make a difference. And in\nparticular, what we're seeing is, for example, many of our mix is across like phone, for example, we're seeing customers gravitate towards our Pro products\nbecause of things like affordability that allows our customers to get into our best products, which have favorable gross margins. So we're continuing to see that\ntrend, that impacted us in the December quarter. As well, I think we're in a favorable commodity environment from a cost standpoint. And so we're benefiting from\nthat as well in the December quarter.
