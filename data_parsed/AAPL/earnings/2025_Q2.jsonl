Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, we are reporting 95.4 billion in revenue, up 5% from a year ago and at the \nhigh end of the range we provided last quarter. Diluted EPS was $1.65, up 8% year-over-year and a March quarter record. Services achieved an all-time revenue \nrecord, growing 12% compared to the prior year. We also set a number of quarterly records in countries and regions across the world, including the UK, Spain, \nFinland, Brazil, Chile, Turkey, Poland, India, and the Philippines. We are as dedicated as ever to the innovation and ingenuity that will enrich our customers' lives \nand help us leave the world better than we found it. And we are proud to increase our impact around the world, including here in the United States, where we \nrecently announced plans to spend $500 billion over the next four years. We're going to be expanding our teams in our facilities in several states, including \nMichigan, Texas, California, Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Oregon, North Carolina, and Washington. And we're going to be opening a new factory for advanced server \nmanufacturing in Texas. During calendar year 2025, we expect to source more than 19 billion chips from a dozen states, including tens of millions of advanced \nchips being made in Arizona this year. We also source glass used in iPhone from an American company. All told, we have more than 9,000 suppliers in the U.S. \nacross all 50 states. Now I'll turn to products, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $46.8 billion, up 2% from a year ago. During the quarter, we introduced \niPhone 16e, a great new entry-level addition to our iPhone 16 lineup. It's powered by our latest generation A18 chip and includes the all-new Apple-designed C1 \nmodem, the most energy-efficient modem ever in an iPhone, allowing iPhone 16e to have the longest battery life of any 6.1-inch iPhone. Meanwhile, iPhone 16 \nand iPhone 16 Plus users are exploring how they can use Camera Control, whether capturing stunning images or exploring the world with Visual Intelligence. And \nour iPhone 16 Pro models continue to be a hit with our users. They are turbocharged by the remarkable capabilities and efficiency of A18 Pro and feature larger \ndisplays, an advanced camera system and a beautiful design. Mac revenue was $7.9 billion, 7% higher year-over-year, another great quarter for Mac. During the \nquarter, we introduced significant new updates to our lineup. The world's most popular laptop just got even better. The M4-powered MacBook Air features a \n12-megapixel Center Stage camera and delivers a massive boost in performance. And now it comes in a beautiful new sky blue color. The new Mac Studio is the \nmost powerful Mac we've ever shipped, equipped with M4 Max and our new M3 Ultra chip. It's a true AI powerhouse capable of running large language models \nwith over 600 billion parameters entirely in memory. Apple Intelligence brings great capabilities to the Mac with features like Writing Tools and Notification \nSummaries that help users stay focused and get more done. Turning to iPad. Revenue for the quarter was $6.4 billion, up 15% from a year ago, another strong \nquarter of double digit growth. Our iPad lineup continues to help users learn, work, play, and go wherever their imaginations take them. The new iPad Air with M3 \ncombines powerful performance and exceptional portability, whether you're taking it across the street or around the world. And Apple Intelligence and Apple \nPencil Pro are a perfect match, with features like the Clean Up Tool in Photos to remove distractions, and Image Wand in the Notes app to elevate simple \nsketches into polished illustrations. Across Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $7.5 billion, down 5% from a year ago. From walking trails to bike \npaths, Apple Watch Series 10 is an essential partner wherever you are on the health and fitness journey. And AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation delivers an \nextraordinary experience in an open-ear design. Customers continue to tell me how important our Hearing Health features for AirPods Pro 2 are to them, and \nwe've been expanding their availability to reach even more users around the world. Millions have already taken hearing tests and the stories we received about \nthe new hearing aid feature are deeply moving, showing how these innovations are making a real difference in people's daily lives. It's a powerful reminder of the \nimpact technology can have when it's designed with care. Meanwhile, Apple Vision Pro takes the concert experience to a whole new level with Metallica, our \nlatest Apple immersive video, which you have to see to believe. And visionOS 2.4 unlocks the first set of Apple Intelligence features for Vision Pro users while \ninviting them to explore a curated and regularly updated collection of spatial experiences with the Spatial Gallery app. In retail, in addition to the two stores we \nopened during the quarter, we're also looking forward to a new retail store in the UAE, the arrival of the online store in Saudi Arabia and new retail stores in India \nstarting later this year. Let's now turn to Services, where we achieved an all-time revenue record of $26.6 billion, up 12% from a year ago with strong performance \nacross all of our categories. From starting their morning with their podcast of choice to buying a coffee with Apple Pay to spending an afternoon reading the latest \nbestseller on Apple Books to using their favorite app from the App Store or an evening workout with Fitness+, Apple Services are enriching our users' lives all \nthroughout their day. With incredible shows like The Studio, Your Friends & Neighbors and the culture-shaping Severance, Apple TV+ has become a must-see \ndestination with record viewership during the quarter. And we're excited for our upcoming movie F1 starring Brad Pitt, which will hit theaters this summer and \ngives an incredible inside look at one of the most intense sports on Earth. And there is so much more to come this year. It's no wonder Apple TV+ has earned \nmore than 2,500 award nominations and 560 wins. We're also reaching sports fans in more ways than ever, from watching our favorite teams go to bat on Friday \nNight Baseball to cheering on their local team with MLS Season Pass to following the results of every Grand Prix with Formula 1 now on the Apple Sports app. \nTurning to software. We just released iOS 18.4, which brought Apple Intelligence to more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, \nJapanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese as well as localized English to Singapore and India. AI and machine learning are core to so many profound features \nwe've rolled out over the years to help our users live a better day. It's why we designed Apple Silicon with a neural engine that powers so many AI features across \nour products and third-party apps. It's also what makes Apple products the best devices for generative AI. At WWDC 24, we announced Apple Intelligence and \nshared our vision for integrating generative AI across our ecosystem into the apps and features our users rely on every day. To achieve this goal, we built our \nown highly capable foundation models that are specialized for everyday tasks. We designed helpful features that are right where our users need them and are \neasy to use. And we went to great lengths to build a system that protects user privacy, whether requests are processed on-device or in the cloud with Private", "char_count": 7500, "word_count": 1246, "token_count": 1599, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

We've also expanded these capabilities to more languages and regions. With regard to the more personal Siri features we announced, we need more\ntime to complete our work on these features so they meet our high-quality bar. We are making progress and we look forward to getting these features into\ncustomers' hands. Turning to sustainability. We just celebrated Earth Day, and we were proud to announce that we've cut our emissions by 60% from our 2015\nlevels. Today, we're using more clean energy across our operations and more recycled materials in our products than ever. We have worked with suppliers to\nbring 17.8 gigawatts of renewable electricity online. We're also saving billions of gallons of freshwater and redirecting millions of metric tons of waste from\nlandfills. All of this will help us make important progress towards our goal of carbon neutrality across our supply chain and the life cycle of our products by 2030.\nNow let me walk you through the impacts of tariffs in the March quarter and give you some color on what we expect for the June quarter. For the March quarter,\nwe had a limited impact from tariffs as we were able to optimize our supply chain and inventory. For the June quarter, currently, we are not able to precisely\nestimate the impact of tariffs as we are uncertain of potential future actions prior to the end of the quarter. However, for some color, assuming the current global\ntariff rates, policies and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add $900 million to our\ncosts. This estimate should not be used to make projections for future quarters as there are certain unique factors that benefit the June quarter. For our part, we\nwill manage the company the way we always have, with thoughtful and deliberate decisions, with a focus on investing for the long term, and with dedication to\ninnovation and the possibilities it creates. As we look ahead, we remain confident, confident that we will continue to build the world's best products and services,\nconfident in our ability to innovate and enrich our users' lives, and confident that we can continue to run our business in a way that has always set Apple apart.\nNext month, we can't wait to welcome our developer community for the Worldwide Developers Conference, and we look forward to revealing some exciting\nannouncements. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevan.", "char_count": 2757, "word_count": 464, "token_count": 562, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

Our March quarter revenue of $95.4 billion was up 5% year-over-year despite a headwind of almost 2.5 percentage\npoints from foreign exchange. We also grew in the majority of the markets we track. Products revenue was $68.7 billion, up 3% year-over-year, driven by growth\nin iPhone, iPad, and Mac. And thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high\nacross all product categories and geographic segments. Services revenue was $26.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year despite over 2 percentage points of foreign\nexchange headwinds. And as Tim mentioned, this was an all-time revenue record. We also grew in every geographic segment and saw double-digit growth in\nboth developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 47.1%, in the middle of our guidance range and up 20 basis points sequentially primarily\ndriven by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 35.9%, down 340 basis points sequentially, driven by mix, foreign exchange and a seasonal loss of leverage.\nServices gross margin was 75.7%, up 70 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by a different mix, partly offset by foreign exchange. Operating expenses\nlanded at $15.3 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Net income was $24.8 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.65, up 8% year-over-year and a March quarter\nrecord. Operating cash flow was also strong at $24 billion. Now I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was\n$46.8 billion, up 2% year- over-year driven by the iPhone 16 family. The iPhone Active installed base grew to an all-time high in total and in every geographic\nsegment, and iPhone upgraders grew double-digits year-over-year. According to a recent survey from Kantar, during the March quarter, iPhone was a top-selling\nmodel in the U.S., urban China, the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan. And we continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 97% as\nmeasured by 451 Research. Mac revenue was $7.9 billion, up 7% year-over-year, driven by the latest MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac Mini models. This\nperformance was broad-based with every geographic segment growing year-over-year. Mac installed base reached an all-time high and we saw strong growth for\nboth upgraders and customers new to the Mac. Customer satisfaction was reported at 95% in the U.S. iPad revenue was $6.4 billion, up 15% year-over-year,\ndriven by the new M3-powered iPad Air. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half the customers who purchased an iPad during the\nquarter were new to the product. Based on the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 97% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories\nrevenue was $7.5 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Keep in mind, we did face a more difficult compare against the launch of the Apple Vision Pro in the year ago\nquarter as well as the Watch Ultra 2 launched last year. At the same time, the Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high with over half of customers\npurchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And customer satisfaction for Watch in the U.S. was recently measured at 95%. Our\nServices revenue reached an all-time high of $26.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year. This growth rate was comparable to the December quarter year-over-year\ngrowth rate when we removed the negative impact from foreign exchange. We saw strong momentum in the March quarter and the growth of our installed base of\nactive devices gives us great opportunities for the future. Customer engagement across our Services offerings also continue to grow. Both transacting and paid\naccounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digits. We have well over 1\nbillion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform. We continue to improve the quality and breadth of our service offerings from additional features in\nNews+ to new games available on Arcade. Apple Pay continues to help our customers with an easy, secure and private payment solution, and we were pleased\nto see that our active users in Apple Pay reached an all-time record, up double-digits year-over-year. Turning to enterprise. Organizations are investing more on\nApple products and services to drive productivity and employee engagement. For example, KPMG recently rolled out iPhone 16 for all U.S. employees, reflecting\ntheir confidence in Apple's security and privacy features. We also continue to see strong Mac performance in enterprise. New Bank, the largest digital bank in\nLatin America has selected MacBook Air as a standard computer for their thousands of employees. With Vision Pro, companies are continuing to find new and\ninnovative ways to leverage this technology. Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, a leading provider for engineering and 3D design software has natively integrated Apple Vision\nPro into their next-generation platform, bringing a powerful and immersive spatial experience to thousands of enterprise customers. Now let's turn to our cash\nposition and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $133 billion in cash and marketable securities. We had $3 billion in debt maturities and increased\ncommercial paper by $4 billion, resulting in $98 billion in total debt. Therefore, at the end of the quarter, net cash was $35 billion. During the quarter, we returned\n$29 billion to shareholders. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25 billion through open market repurchases of 108 million Apple shares.\nGiven the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, today, our Board authorized an additional $100 billion for share repurchases as\nwe maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral. We're also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.26 per share of common stock, and we continue to plan for annual\nincreases in the dividend going forward as we have done for the last 13 years. This cash dividend will be payable on May 15, 2025, to shareholders of record as\nof May 12, 2025. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini\nreferred to. Importantly, the color we're providing assumes that global tariff rates, policies and application remain in effect as of this call. And the global\nmacroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from today for the current quarter. Despite the overall uncertain environment, we will still be providing color at the total\ncompany level, subject to these assumptions and the risk factors that we referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect our June quarter total company\nrevenue to grow low to mid-single digits year-over-year. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%, which includes the estimated impact of the\n$900 million of tariff-related costs that Tim referred to earlier. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.3 billion and $15.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be\naround negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%.

It's Tim. The existing tariffs that apply to Apple today are based on the product's country of origin as you alluded to. For the June quarter, we do\nexpect the majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will have India as their country of origin and Vietnam to be the country of origin for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple\nWatch, and AirPods products sold in the -- also sold in the U.S. China would continue to be the country of origin for the vast majority of total product sales outside\nthe U.S. And so if you look at the categories of tariffs that are applicable to us today, for the June quarter, most of our tariff exposure relates to the February\nIEEPA-related tariff at the rate of 20%, which applies to imports to the U.S. for products that have China as their country of origin. In addition, for China, there was\nan additional 125% tariff for imports of certain categories of products announced in April. And for us, that's some of our U.S. AppleCare and Accessories\nbusinesses and brings the total rate in China for these products to at least 145%. Also for transparency and clarity, the vast majority of our products, including\niPhone, Mac, iPad, Apple Watch, and Vision Pro, are currently not subject to the global reciprocal tariffs that were announced in April as the Commerce\nDepartment has initiated a Section 232 investigation into imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment and downstream products that\ncontain semiconductors. And so if you -- for the June quarter, as I talked about in the -- in my opening comments, we estimate the impact, assuming that the\ncurrent global tariff, rates, policies and applications don't change for the balance of the quarter, to be 900 million to our costs. I wouldn't want to predict the mix of\nproduction in the future, but I wanted to give you clarity for the June quarter of where the country of origins are so you can use that for your modeling.", "char_count": 1930, "word_count": 338, "token_count": 420, "exchange_id": "ex_001", "exchange_role": "answer"}

And again, for going\nout of the way for transparency, the channel inventory at the end of March, the unit channel inventory was similar to where we started the quarter.
