Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% \nfrom a year ago and better than we had expected. EPS grew double digits to $1.40 and achieved a record for the June quarter. We also set quarterly revenue \nrecords in more than two dozen countries and regions, including Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, the UK, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. And \nwe set an all-time revenue record in services which grew 14%. At our Worldwide Developers Conference, we were thrilled to unveil game-changing updates \nacross our platforms, including Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovation and investment in AI and Machine Learning. It will transform \nhow users interact with technology, from writing tools to help you express yourself, to image playground, which gives you the ability to create fun images and \ncommunicate in new ways, to powerful tools for summarizing and prioritizing notifications. Siri also becomes more natural, more useful, and more personal than \never. Apple Intelligence is built on a foundation of privacy, both through on-device processing that does not collect users' data and through private cloud compute, \na groundbreaking new approach to using the cloud, while protecting users' information powered by Apple silicon. We are also integrating ChatGPT into \nexperiences within iPhone, Mac, and iPad, enabling users to draw on a broad base of world knowledge. We are very excited about Apple Intelligence and we \nremain incredibly optimistic about the extraordinary possibilities of AI and its ability to enrich customers' lives. We will continue to make significant investments in \nthis technology and dedicate ourselves to the innovation that will unlock its full potential. Recently, we've also been excited to bring Apple Vision Pro to more \ncountries, giving customers the chance to discover the remarkable capabilities of this magical device. Vision Pro users are customizing their own workspaces, \nwatching movies on 100-foot screens, and exploring entire worlds with just a pinch of their fingertips. With more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million \ncompatible apps for Vision OS, the developer community continues to pioneer stunning spatial experiences that are only possible with Vision Pro. Last month, we \nannounced that we're bringing some amazing new immersive content to Vision Pro, including new series, concerts, films, and more. And we've seen great \ninterest for Vision Pro in the enterprise, where it can empower companies large and small to pursue their best ideas like never before. With each innovation, we're \nunlocking new ways of working, new ways of learning, and new ways of tapping into the unlimited promise of human potential. We are doing that across every \nproduct and every service. Now let me share more detail in our June quarter results, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% \nyear-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we grew compared to last year. Customers continue to praise the iPhone 15 lineup for its incredible battery life, \nexceptional cameras, and unmatched power and performance. And we are excited to bring incredible new features to the iPhone with iOS 18, making it more \npersonal, capable, and intelligent than ever before. This update includes the biggest redesign of the Photos app, new customization options for the home screen, \nmessages over satellite, and the introduction of Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence utilizes the power of our most advanced iPhones, the iPhone 15 Pro and", "char_count": 3654, "word_count": 569, "token_count": 721, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

With back-to-school season upon us, MacBook Air is the perfect companion for students on campus and small business owners, developers, \nand creatives of all kinds depend on Mac to do more than they ever could before. Powered by Apple silicon with its neural engine and privacy built in at the chip \nlevel, Macs are simply the best personal computers for AI. And every Mac we've shipped with Apple silicon since 2020, is capable of taking advantage of Apple \nIntelligence with Mac OS Sequoia. We also know the importance of security for our users and enterprises so we continue to advance protections across our \nproducts. Turning to iPad, revenue was $7.2 billion, 24% higher year-over-year. During the quarter, we had an incredible launch where we unveiled the all-new 11 \nand 13 inch iPad Air, the perfect device for education, entertainment, and so much more. And With the new iPad Pro, we pushed the boundaries of \npower-efficient performance with the remarkable M4 chip, the engine behind this incredibly thin device. By leveraging the latest in Apple silicon, Video Editors and \nMusicians can take advantage of the cutting edge AI features in Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro. And we're very excited that iPad Pro and iPad Air models powered \nby the M series of Apple silicon will be able to utilize the powerful capabilities of Apple Intelligence. In wearables, home, and accessories, revenue was $8.1 \nbillion, down 2% from a year ago. Apple Watch is empowering users to live a healthier day with a range of tools to take charge of their wellness journeys. At the \ncore of Apple Watch, are powerful AI features that are helping users get help when they need it most, from irregular heart rhythm notifications to walking \nsteadiness to crash detection and fall detection. I've heard time and again how meaningful these features are for users and their loved ones, and their stories \nmotivate us to keep pushing forward on this vital work. As I mentioned earlier, in services, we set an all-time revenue record of $24.2 billion with paid \nsubscriptions climbing to an all-time high. We achieve revenue records in the majority of the services categories with all-time revenue records in advertising, \ncloud, and payment services. Apple TV+ productions are delighting audiences on screens large and small. We're sharing powerful works of imagination with \nseries and movies like Presumed Innocent, the Upcoming Disclaimer, and The Instigators starring Matt Damon. And we can't wait for returning fan favorites with \nnew seasons of The Morning Show, Slow Horses, and Severance. Apple TV+ productions also continue to earn accolades with nearly 2,300 nominations and 500 \nwins to-date. That includes 72 Emmy Award nominations across 16 programs our best ever showing for the upcoming awards event. During the quarter, we also \nexpanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets including Japan, Canada, Italy, and Germany, enabling more businesses to use the power of iPhone to accept \ncontactless payments. And we announced new updates to our services coming this fall, including US national park hikes and custom walk routes and Apple \nMaps, the ability to pay with rewards using Apple Pay, collaborative listening with Apple Music, and a redesigned Apple Fitness+ experience to help users make \nthe most of our library of workouts and meditations. Turning to retail, we continue to expand in emerging markets with our first ever location in Malaysia. \nCustomers from all over the country came together with our team members to celebrate this special moment. Elsewhere in the world, our teams have been \nsharing the magic of Apple Vision Pro and demos that delight, inspire, and deeply move customers exploring the wonders of spatial computing for the first time. At \nthe heart of all of our innovations are the values that guide everything we do. We believe fundamentally that the best technology is technology that works for \neveryone. And in honor of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we introduced all new capabilities to give users more ways to take advantage of all our products\n\ncan do. These include eye tracking for users to control iPhone or iPad visually, music haptics to give those who are deaf or hard of hearing a tangible way to\nexperience music, and vocal shortcuts that tie task to a user's voice. And we are committed as ever to shipping products that offer the highest standards of\nprivacy for our users. With everything we do, whether it's offering a browser like Safari that prevents third-parties from tracking you across the internet or\nproviding new features like the ability to lock and hide apps, we are determined to keep our users in control of their own data. And we are just as dedicated to\nensuring the security of our users' data. That's why we work to minimize the amount of data we collect and work to maximize how much is processed directly on\npeople's devices, a foundational principle that is at the core of all we build, including Apple Intelligence. And we continue to make significant progress on the\nenvironment. We are proud to say that all of our data centers, including those that will run private cloud compute, operate on 100% renewable energy. At Apple,\nwe're constantly accelerating our pace of innovation. We are a company in relentless pursuit of big ideas. Time and again, we've seen how a spark of creativity\ncan reach breakthrough velocity, reach across previously unexplored dimensions, and ultimately take flight in ways that can change the world. It's why we're\ngoing to keep investing in the meaningful innovation that enriches the lives of all of our customers.

We are very pleased to report a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year, despite\n230 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact. We achieved growth in the vast majority of our markets, with June quarter revenue records in the\nAmericas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $61.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Our\ninstalled base of active devices reach an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to our unmatched levels of customer satisfaction and\nloyalty and a large number of customers who are new to our products. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with\nan all-time record in developed markets and a June quarter record in emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.3% near the high end of our guidance\nrange and down 30 basis points sequentially driven by a different mix within products which was partially offset by a favorable mix shift towards services and cost\nsavings. Products gross margin was 35.3%, down 130 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin\nwas 74% down 60 basis points from last quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided and up 7%\nyear-over-year. Net income was $21.4 billion, diluted EPS of $1.40 was up 11% year-over-year and set a June quarter record. And operating cash flow was very\nstrong at $28.9 billion, also a June quarter record. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1%\nyear-over-year, but grew on a constant currency basis. We set June quarter records across several countries, including the UK, Spain, Poland, Mexico,\nIndonesia, and the Philippines. And the iPhone Active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the June\nquarter, many iPhone models were among the top selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top selling\nmodel in the US, urban China, the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan. Customer satisfaction on the iPhone 15 family continues to be extremely high, with 451\nResearch measuring it at 98% in the US in their latest reports. Mac generated $7 billion in revenue, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the MacBook Air powered by\nthe M3 chip. We saw particularly strong performance in our emerging markets, with June quarter records for Mac in Latin America, India, and South Asia. The\nMac installed base reached an all-time high with half of MacBook Air customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And customer satisfaction for Mac was recently\nreported at 96% in the US. iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, up 24% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Customers are loving\nthe latest iPad lineup for its new design and display, unparalleled performance, AI capabilities and much more. The iPad install base has continued to grow and is\nan all-time high, as half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at\n97% in the US. Wearables, home and accessories revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year, a sequential acceleration from the March quarter. Watch\nand AirPods continue to face a difficult compare against prior year launches of the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. Apple\nWatch continues to attract new customers, with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending\nthe Apple Watch install base to a new all-time high. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicate a customer satisfaction of 97% for watch in the US. In\nservices, total revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year. We continue to have great momentum in services, as the growth\nof our installed base of active devices, sets a strong foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. And we see increased customer engagement with our\nservices offerings. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reach a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Also, paid\nsubscriptions showed strong double digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number\nthat we had only four years ago. And we are constantly focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services. From critically acclaimed new content on\nApple TV+ to new games on Apple Arcade and the many latest features we previewed during WWDC for iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Cash, Apple Music, and more.\nTurning to enterprise, we continue to see businesses, leveraging our entire suite of products to drive productivity and creativity for their teams and customers.\nUSAA, a leading insurance and financial services company, recently expanded beyond their existing iPhone and iPad deployments to provide their employees\nwith the latest MacBook Air. And American Express has continued to add to their fleet of over 10,000 Macs to enhance their employees' productivity, security, and\ncollaboration. We're also excited to see leading organizations such as Boston Children's Hospital and Lufthansa using Apple Vision Pro to build innovative spatial\ncomputing experiences to transform the training of their workforces. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with\n$153 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $4.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving us with total debt of\n$101 billion. As a result, net cash was $52 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $32 billion to shareholders, including $3.9 billion\nin dividends and equivalents and $26 billion through open market repurchases of 139 million Apple shares. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like\nto review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing\ntoday assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect foreign exchange to\ncontinue to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 1.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. We expect our September\nquarter total company revenue to grow year-over-year at a rate similar to the June quarter. We expect services revenue to grow double digits at a rate similar to\nwhat we reported in the first three quarters of this fiscal year. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.2\nbillion and $14.4 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments, and\nour tax rate to be around 16.5%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on August 15,\n2024, to shareholders of record as of August 12, 2024.

And if you look at it on a constant currency basis, we declined\nby less than 3%. So over 50% of the decline year-over-year is currency related. That is an improvement from the first half of the fiscal year, and so we're happy to\nsee the acceleration. If you look at iPhone in particular for Greater China, the installed base set a record. We also in Mainland China set a June quarter record for\nupgraders and so that's a very strong signal and in fact from Kantar -- the survey from Kantar this quarter showed that iPhones were the top three models in\nurban China. Also, if you look at -- one of the things we look at is the 15 family compared to the 14 family for the same number of weeks from launch. So this goes\nall the way back to the September of 2023. If you look at that, the 15 is outperforming the 14. And so those are some of the color I would provide. In addition, one\nof the things that we're very focused on is the level of new customers buying our products. And so if you look at this on the Mac and iPad, in Mainland China, the\nmajority of customers buying or buying for the first time, buying that product for the first time and the watch, the vast, vast majority of people are buying a product\nfor the first time. And during the quarter, I should say also that iPad returned to growth in Greater China, as it did around the world. And so we continue to be\nconfident in the long-term opportunity in China.

I think I'll give you a bit of the walk for the June quarter and then get into the outlook that we provided for the September quarter. At the total company \nlevel, we've reported 46.3%. It is down 30 basis points sequentially, and it was really driven by a different mix. Within products, of course, we launched very \nimportant products like the iPad during the course of the quarter. But we had an offset from a shift in mix towards Services, and we got some good cost savings. \nAnd so when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, we are up significantly on the margin front. And keep in mind that foreign exchange continues to be a bit of\n\na headwind for us. As we go into the September quarter, we are guiding 45.5% to 46.5%, which is kind of within the guidance that we provided last quarter. Again\nsimilar dynamics, we expect a slightly different mix. We expect foreign exchange to have a minimal impact sequentially, although a more significant impact on a\nyear-over-year basis.

We have more transacting accounts every quarter, so more people using the ecosystem both\nthe free elements of the ecosystem and the paid elements. We see paid accounts growing double digits, and we've seen that for many, many quarters. Now we\nlook at our paid subscriptions on our platform, and they are growing strong double digits as well. So obviously, the growing level of engagement helps us both\nfrom an ARPU standpoint and just a volume standpoint. Obviously, as you've seen over the last several years, we launched new services over time, and we've\nlaunched many new services, fairly recently. Obviously, our payments business is relatively new, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Fitness+, so many other services\nwe've added. And so we are providing more and more opportunities for our customers to interact with the ecosystem. And we believe we are doing also a very\ngood job at improving the quality of these services and improving the amount of content that we make available. We continue to make significant investments on\nTV+, on Apple Arcade. We are launching new shows, new games all the time. And I think you will continue to see that as we go forward. We are very, very happy\nwith the 14% growth that we had this quarter because, particularly if you look at the performance that we had in Services a year ago, the compares for us tend to\nget a bit more challenging in the second half of our fiscal year.
