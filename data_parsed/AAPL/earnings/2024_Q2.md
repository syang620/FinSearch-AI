remarks.

### Tim Cook (CFO)

Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $90.8 billion and an EPS record of $1.53 for 
the March quarter. We set revenue records in more than a dozen countries and regions. These include, among others, March quarter records in Latin-America 
and the Middle East, as well as Canada, India, Spain and Turkey. We also achieved an all-time revenue record in Indonesia, one of the many markets where we 
continue to see so much potential. In services, we set an all-time revenue record, up 14% over the past year. Keep in mind, as we described on the last call, in 
the March quarter a year-ago, we were able to replenish iPhone channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the December quarter 
COVID-related supply disruptions on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max. We estimate this one-time impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter revenue 
last year. If we remove this from last year's results, our March quarter total company revenue this year would have grown. Despite this impact, we were still able 
to deliver the records I described. Of course, this past quarter, we were thrilled to launch Apple Vision Pro and it has been so wonderful to hear from people who 
now get to experience the magic of spatial computing. They describe the impossible becoming possible right before their eyes and they share their amazement 
and their emotions about what they can do now, whether it's reliving their most treasured memories or having a movie theater experience right in their living room. 
It's also great to see the enthusiasm from the enterprise market. For example, more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought Apple Vision 
Pro units and are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren't possible before, and this is just the beginning. Looking ahead, we're getting ready 
for an exciting product announcement next week that we think our customers will love. And next month, we have our Worldwide Developers Conference, which 
has generated enormous enthusiasm from our developers. We can't wait to reveal what we have in-store. We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in 
Generative AI. We are making significant investments, and we're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers soon. We believe in the 
transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple's unique combination of 
seamless hardware, software and services integration, groundbreaking Apple's silicon, with our industry-leading neural engines and our unwavering focus on 
privacy, which underpins everything we create. As we push innovation forward, we continue to manage thoughtfully and deliberately through an uneven 
macroeconomic environment and remain focused on putting our users at the center of everything we do. Now let's turn to our results for the March quarter across 
each product category, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue for the March quarter was $46 billion, down 10% year-over-year. We faced a difficult compare 
over the previous year due to the $5 billion impact that I mentioned earlier. However, we still saw growth on iPhone in some markets, including Mainland China, 
and according to Kantar during the quarter, the two best-selling smartphones in Urban China were the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max. I was in China recently 
where I had the chance to meet with developers and creators who are doing remarkable things with iPhone. And just a couple of weeks ago, I visited Vietnam, 
Indonesia and Singapore, where it was incredible to see all the ways customers and communities are using our products and services to do amazing things. 
Everywhere I travel, people have such a great affinity for Apple, and it's one of the many reasons I'm so optimistic about the future. Turning to Mac. March quarter 
revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% from a year ago. We had an amazing launch in early March with the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air. The world's most 
popular laptop is the best consumer laptop for AI with breakthrough performance of the M3 chip and it’s even more powerful neural engine. Whether it's an 
entrepreneur starting a new business or a college student finishing their degree, users depend on the power and portability of MacBook Air to take them places 
they couldn't have gone without it. In iPad, revenue for the March quarter was $5.6 billion, 17% lower year-over-year, due to a difficult compare with the 
momentum following the launch of M2 iPad Pro and the 10th Generation iPad last fiscal year. iPad continues to stand apart for its versatility, power and 
performance. For video editors, music makers and creatives of all kinds, iPad is empowering users to do more than they ever could with a tablet. Across 
Wearables, Home and Accessories, March quarter revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% from a year-ago due to a difficult launch compare on Watch and AirPods. 
Apple Watch is helping runners go the extra mile on their wellness journeys, keeping hikers on course with the latest navigation capabilities in watchOS 10, and 
enabling users of all fitness levels to live a healthier day. Across our watch lineup, we're harnessing AI and machine-learning to power lifesaving features like a 
regular rhythm notifications and fall detection. I often hear about how much these features mean to users and their loved ones and I'm thankful that so many 
people are able to get help in their time of greatest need. As I shared earlier, we set an all-time revenue record in services with $23.9 billion, up 14% 
year-over-year. We also achieved all-time revenue records across several categories and geographic segments. Audiences are tuning in on screens large, small 
and spatial and are enjoying Apple TV+ Originals like Palm Royale and Sugar. And we have some incredible theatrical releases coming this year, including 
Wolves, which reunites George Clooney and Brad Pitt. Apple TV+ productions continue to be celebrated as major awards contenders. Since launch, Apple TV+ 
productions have earned more than 2,100 award nominations and 480 wins. Meanwhile, we're enhancing the live sports experience with a new iPhone app, 
Apple Sports. This free app allows fans to follow their favorite teams and leagues with real-time scores, stats and more. Apple Sports is the perfect companion for 
MLS Season Pass subscribers. Turning to retail, our stores continued to be vital spaces for connection and innovation. I was delighted to be in Shanghai for the 
opening of our latest flagship store. The energy and enthusiasm from our customers was truly something to behold. And across the United States, our incredible 
retail teams have been sharing Vision Pro demos with customers, delighting them with a profound and emotional experience of using it for the very first time. 
Everywhere we operate and everything we do, we're guided by our mission to enrich users' lives and lead the world better than we found it, whether we're making 
Apple podcasts more accessible with a new transcripts feature or helping to safeguard iMessage users' privacy with new protections that can defend against 
advances in quantum computing. Our environmental work is another great example of how innovation and our values come together. As we work toward our goal 
of being carbon-neutral across all of our products by 2030, we are proud of how we've been able to innovate and do more for our customers while taking less 
from the planet. Since 2015, Apple has cut our overall emissions by more than half, while revenue grew nearly 65% during that same time period. And we're now 
using more recycled materials in our products than ever before. Earlier this spring, we launched our first-ever product to use 50% recycled materials with a new

M3-powered MacBook Air. We're also investing in new solar and wind power in the U.S. and Europe, both to power our growing operations and our users'
devices. And we're working with partners in India and the U.S. to replenish 100% of the water we use in places that need it most with the goal of delivering billions
of gallons of water benefits over the next two decades. Through our Restore Fund, Apple has committed $200 million to nature-based carbon removal projects.
And last month, we welcomed two supplier partners as new investors, who will together invest up to an additional $80 million in the fund. Whether we're enriching
lives of users across the globe or doing our part to be a force for good in the world, we do everything with a deep sense of purpose at Apple. And I'm proud of the
impact we've already made at the halfway point in a year of unprecedented innovation. I couldn't be more excited for the future we have ahead of us, driven by
the imagination and innovation of our teams and the enduring importance of our products and services in people's lives. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.

### Luca Maestri (Unknown)

Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $90.8 billion, down 4% from last year. Foreign exchange had a negative
year-over-year impact of 140 basis points on our results. Products revenue was $66.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to the challenging compare on
iPhone that Tim described earlier, which was partially offset by strength from Mac. And thanks to our unparalleled customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high
number of customers who are new to our products, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments.
Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year with record performance in both developed and emerging markets. Company
gross margin was 46.6%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings and favorable mix to services, partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin
was 36.6%, down 280 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin
was 74.6%, up 180 basis points from last quarter due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.4 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we
provided and up 5% year-over-year. Net income was $23.6 billion, diluted EPS was $1.53 and a March quarter record, and operating cash flow was strong at
$22.7 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46 billion, down 10% year-over-year, due to the almost $5
billion impact from a year ago that Tim described earlier. Adjusting for this one-time impact, iPhone revenue would be roughly flat to last year. Our iPhone active
installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. And during the March quarter, we saw many iPhone models as the top-selling
smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, an iPhone was the top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, Australia, the U.K.,
France, Germany and Japan. And the iPhone 15 family continues to be very popular with customers. 451 Research recently measured customer satisfaction at
99% in the U.S. Mac revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our new MacBook Air, powered by the M3 chip. Customers are
loving the incredible AI performance of the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. And our Mac installed base reached an all-time high with half of our
MacBook Air buyers during the quarter being new to Mac. Also customer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the U.S. iPad generated $5.6 billion
in revenue, down 17% year-over-year. iPad continued to face a challenging compare against the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and iPad 10th Generation from last
year. At the same time, the iPad installed base has continued to grow and is at an all-time high as over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the
quarter were new to the product. In addition, the latest reports from 451 Research indicated customer satisfaction of 96% for iPad in the US. Wearables, Home
and Accessories revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to a difficult launch compare. Last year, we had the continued benefit from the launches
of the AirPods Pro second-generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. Apple Watch continues to attract new customers, with almost two-thirds of
customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch installed base to a new all-time high and customer
satisfaction was recently measured at 95% in the U.S. In services, as I mentioned, total revenue reached an all-time record of $23.9 billion, growing 14%
year-over-year with our installed-base of active devices continuing to grow at a nice pace. This provides a strong foundation for the future growth of the services
business as we continued to see increased customer engagement with our ecosystem. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high
with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. And paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over $1 billion paid
subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. We continued to improve the breadth and
quality of our current services from creating new games on Arcade and great new shows on TV+ to launching additional countries and partners for Apple Pay.
Turning to enterprise, our customers continued to invest in Apple products to drive productivity and innovation. We see more and more enterprise customers
embracing the Mac. In Healthcare, Epic Systems, the world's largest electronic medical record provider, recently launched its native app for the Mac, making it
easier for healthcare organizations like Emory Health to transition thousands of PCs to the Mac for clinical use. And since the launch of Vision Pro last quarter,
many leading enterprise customers have been investing in this amazing new product to bring spatial computing apps and experiences to life. We are seeing so
many compelling use cases from aircraft engine maintenance training at KLM Airlines to real-time team collaboration for racing at Porsche to immersive kitchen
design at Lowe's. We couldn't be more excited about the spatial computing opportunity in enterprise. Taking a quick step back, when we look at our performance
during the first-half of our fiscal year, total company revenue was roughly flat to the prior year in spite of having one less week of sales during the period and
some foreign exchange headwinds. We were particularly pleased with our strong momentum in emerging markets, as we set first-half revenue records in several
countries and regions, including Latin-America, the Middle East, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Turkey. These results, coupled with double-digit growth in
services and strong levels of gross margin, drove a first half diluted EPS record of $3.71, up 9% from last year. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital
return program. We ended the quarter with $162 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $3.2 billion in maturing debt and commercial paper was
unchanged sequentially, leaving us with total debt of $105 billion. As a result, net cash was $58 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned
over $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $23.5 billion through open-market repurchases of $130 million Apple's
shares. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, our Board has authorized today an additional $110 billion for share
repurchases, as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash-neutral over time. We are also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.25 per share of common stock, and
we continued to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward as we've done for the last 12 years. This cash dividend will be payable on May 16, 2024
to shareholders of record as of May 13, 2024. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking
information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from
what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect our June quarter total company revenue to grow low-single-digits year-over-year in spite of a
foreign exchange headwind of about 2.5 percentage points. We expect our services business to grow double-digits at a rate similar to the growth we reported for
the first-half of the fiscal year. And we expect iPad revenue to grow double-digits. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% to -- and 46.5%. We expect
OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority
investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. With that, let's open the call to questions.

### Suhasini Chandramouli (Unknown)

Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?
Operator
Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Mike Ng (Goldman Sachs)**: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I have two, first, I'll ask about the June quarter guidance. The revenue outlook for low-single digits
growth, I was wondering if you could run through some of the product assumptions, iPhone, like what kind of gives you confidence around that? And then on the
service momentum, what was better than expected in the quarter? And then I just have a quick follow-up.

### Exchange 002

**Mike Ng (Goldman Sachs)**: Great. Thank you. And I wanted to ask about, as Apple leans more into AI and Generative AI, should we expect any changes to the historical CapEx cadence that
we've seen in the last few years of about $10 billion to $11 billion per year or any changes to, you know, how we may have historically thought about the split
between tooling, data center and facilities? Thank you very much.

### Exchange 003

**Mike Ng (Goldman Sachs)**: Excellent. Thank you very much.

### Exchange 004

**Wamsi Mohan (Bank of America)**: Yes, thank you so much. Tim, can you talk about the implications to Apple from the changes driven by EU DMA? You've had to open up third-party app stores,
clearly disposes some security risks on the one-hand, which can dilute the experience, but also lower payments from developers to Apple. What are you seeing
developers choose in these early days and consumers choose in terms of these third-party app stores? And I have a follow-up.

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: It's really too early to answer the question. We just implemented in March, as you probably know, in the European Union, the alternate app stores and alternate
billing, et cetera. So we're focused on complying while mitigating the impacts to user privacy and security that you mentioned. And so that's our focus.

### Exchange 005

**Wamsi Mohan (Bank of America)**: Okay. Thank you, Tim. And Luca, I was wondering if you could comment a bit on the product gross margins, the sequential step down. You noted both mix and
leverage. Any more color on the mix, if you could share if customers are at all starting to mix down across product lines or is this more a mix across product lines?
Just trying to get some color on customer behavior given some of the broader inflationary pressures. Thank you so much.

### Exchange 006

**Wamsi Mohan (Bank of America)**: Thank you so much.

### Exchange 007

**Erik Woodring (Morgan Stanley)**: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe my first one, Tim, you've obviously mentioned your excitement around Generative AI multiple times. I'm
just curious how Apple is thinking about the different ways in which you can monetize this technology because historically software upgrades haven't been a big
factor in driving product cycles. And so could AI be potentially different? And how could that impact replacement cycles? Is there any services angle you'd be
thinking? Any early color that you can share on that? And then I have a follow up, please. Thanks.

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: I don't want to get in front of our announcements, obviously. I would just say that we see Generative AI as a very key opportunity across our products. And we
believe that we have advantages that set us apart there. And we'll be talking more about it in as we go through the weeks ahead.

### Exchange 008

**Erik Woodring (Morgan Stanley)**: Okay. Very fair. Thank you. And then Luca, maybe to just follow up on Wamsi's comments or question. There's a broad concern about the headwind that rising
commodity costs have on your product gross margins. Wondering if you could just clarify for us if we take a step back and look at all of the components and
commodities that go into your products kind of collectively, are we -- are you seeing these costs rising? Are they falling? What tools do you have to try to help and
mitigate some rising costs if at all, rising input costs if at all? Thank you so much.

### Exchange 009

**Erik Woodring (Morgan Stanley)**: Thank you so much.

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: Yes, Ben, if you look at our results in Q2 for Greater China, we were down 8%. That's an acceleration from the previous quarter in Q1. And the primary driver of
the acceleration was iPhone. And if you then look at iPhone within Mainland China, we grew on a reported basis. That's before any kind of normalization for the
supply disruption that we mentioned earlier. And if you look at the top-selling smartphones, the Top 2 in Urban China are iPhones. And while I was there, it was a
great visit and we opened a new store in Shanghai and the reception was very warm and highly energetic, and so I left there having a fantastic trip and enjoyed
being there. And so I maintain a great view of China in the long-term. I don't know how each and every quarter goes and each and every week. But over the long
haul, I have a very positive viewpoint.

### Exchange 010

**Krish Sankar (Cowen)**: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Again, sorry to beat the AI haul. But Tim, I know you don't want to like reveal a lot. But I'm just kind of curious, because
last quarter you spoke about how you're getting traction in enterprise. Is the AI strategy going to be both consumer and enterprise or is it going to be one after the
other? Any color would be helpful? And then, I have a follow-up for Luca.

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: Our focus on enterprise has been and you know through the quarter and the quarters that preceded it on selling iPhones and iPads and Macs and we recently
added Vision Pro to that. And we're thrilled with what we see there in terms of interest from big companies buying some to explore ways they can use it. And so I
see enormous opportunity in the enterprise. I wouldn't want to cabin that to AI only. I think there's a great opportunity for us around the world in the enterprise.

### Exchange 011

**Krish Sankar (Cowen)**: Got it. Very helpful. And then for Luca, you know, I'm kind of curious on -- given the macro-environment, on the hardware side, are you seeing a bias towards like
standard iPhone versus the Pro model? The reason I'm asking the question is that there's a weaker consumer spending environment, yet your services business
is still growing and has amazing gross margins. So I'm just trying to like square the circle over there. Thank you.

### Exchange 012

**Krish Sankar (Cowen)**: Got it. Thank you very much, Luca, and thanks, Tim.

### Exchange 013

**Amit Daryanani (Evercore)**: Thanks for taking my question. I have two as well. You know, I guess, first off on capital allocation, you folks have about $58 billion of net cash right now. As you
think about eventually getting to this net cash-neutral target, do you think at some point, Apple would be open to taking on leverage on the balance sheet and
continuing the buyback program? Or is it more like once you get to this neutral position, it's going to be about returning free cash flow back to shareholders? I'm
just wondering, how do you think about leverage on your balance sheet over time and what sort of leverage do you think you'd be comfortable taking on?

### Exchange 014

**Amit Daryanani (Evercore)**: Fair enough. I figure it's worth trying anyway. If I go back to this China discussion a bit and, you know, Tim, I think your comments around growth in iPhones in 
Mainland China is really notable. Could you step back, I mean, these numbers are still declining at least Greater China on a year-over-year basis in aggregate. 
Maybe just talk about what are you seeing from a macro basis in China and then at least annual decline -- or year-over-year declines that we're seeing. Do you

think it's more macro driven or more competitive driven over there? That would be helpful.

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: Yes, I can only tell you what we're seeing. And so I don't want to present myself as a economist. So I'll steer clear of that. From what we saw was an acceleration
from Q1, and it was driven by iPhone and iPhone in Mainland China before we adjust for this $5 billion impact that we talked about earlier did grow. That means
the other products didn't fare as well. And so we clearly have work there to do. I think it has been and is through last quarter, the most competitive market in the
world. And I -- so I, you know, wouldn't say anything other than that. I've said that before, and I believe that it was last quarter as well. And -- but if you step back
from the 90-day cycle, what I see is a lot of people moving into the middle class, a -- we try to serve customers very well there and have a lot of happy customers
and you can kind of see that in the latest store opening over there. And so I continue to feel very optimistic.

### Exchange 015

**Amit Daryanani (Evercore)**: Great. Thank you.

### Exchange 016

**David Vogt (UBS)**: Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. I'm going to roll the two together, so you guys have them both. So Luca obviously, I'm trying to parse through the
outlook for the June quarter. And just based on the quick math, it looks like all things being equal, given what you said, the iPhone business is going to be down
mid-single-digits again in the June quarter. And if that's the case and maybe this is for Tim obviously, how are you thinking about the competitive landscape in the
context of what you just said maybe outside of China and what changes sort of, the consumer demand or receptivity to new devices because we've been in this
malaise for a while. Is it really this AI initiative that a lot of companies are pursuing? And do you think that changes sort of the demand drivers going forward? Or
is it just really more of a timing issue in terms of the replacement cycle is a little bit long in the tooth, and we see a bit of an upgrade cycle at some point, maybe
later this year into next year? Thanks.

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: I do see a key opportunity, as I've mentioned before with Generative AI with all of our devices or the vast majority of our devices. And so I think that if you look out
that that's not within the next quarter or so and we don't guide at the product level, but I'm extremely optimistic. And so that -- that's kind of how I view it. In terms
of the -- I'll let Luca comment on the outlook portion of it. I think if you step back on iPhone though and you make this adjustment from the previous year, our Q2
results would be flattish on iPhone. And so that's how we performed in Q2.

### Exchange 017

**David Vogt (UBS)**: Great. Thanks guys. I'll get back in the queue.

### Exchange 018

**Samik Chatterjee (JPMorgan)**: Hi, thanks for taking my question, and I have a couple as well. Maybe for the first one, your services growth accelerated from 11% growth to 14%. If you can sort
of dig into the drivers of where or which parts of services did you really see that acceleration? And why it isn't a bit more sustainable as we think about the next
quarter? Because I believe you're guiding more to sort of averaging out the first half of the year for the next quarter. So just curious what were the drivers and why
not have it a bit more sustainably sort of improve as we go through the remainder of the year? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.

### Exchange 019

**Samik Chatterjee (JPMorgan)**: Got it. Got it. And for my follow up, if I can ask you more specifically about the India market. Obviously, you continue to make new records in terms of revenue in
that market. How much of the momentum you're seeing would you associate with your sort of retail strategy in that market, retail expansion relative to maybe
some of the supply change or the sort of manufacturing changes or strategy you've undergone or taken in that market itself. Any thoughts around that would be
helpful?

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: Sure. We did grow strong double-digit. And so we were very, very pleased about it. It was a new March quarter revenue record for us. As you know, as I've said
before, I see it as an incredibly exciting market and it's a major focus for us. In terms of the operational side or supply chain side, we are producing there, from a
pragmatic point of view, you need to produce there to be competitive. And so yes, there the two things are linked from that point of view. But we have both
operational things going on and we have go-to-market, and initiatives going on. We just opened a couple of stores as last year, as you know, and we see
enormous opportunity there. We're continuing to expand our channels, and also working on the developer ecosystem as well. And we've been very pleased that
there is a rapidly-growing base of developers there. And so, we're working all of the entire ecosystem from developer to the market to operations, the whole thing.
And I just -- I could not be more excited and enthusiastic about it.

### Exchange 020

**Samik Chatterjee (JPMorgan)**: Got it. Thank you. Thanks for that.

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: I can't address the data points. I can only address what our results are. And we did accelerate last quarter, and the iPhone grew in Mainland China. So that's what
the results were. I can't bridge to numbers we didn't come up with.
