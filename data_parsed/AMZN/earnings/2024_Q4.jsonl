Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2024 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO, and Brian\nOlsoski, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well\nas metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period\nof 2023. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 6, 2025 only and will include forward-looking\nstatements, actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press\nrelease and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-Ks and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non\nGAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You\nwill find additional disclosures regarding these non GAAP measures. Including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance\nincorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may\nbe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, and customer\ndemand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the\nInternet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance\nassumes among other things that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements.

Today, we're reporting $187.8 billion in revenue, up 10% year over year. Given the way the dollar strengthened throughout the quarter, we had \n$700 million more foreign exchange headwind than we anticipated at guidance. Without that headwind, revenue would have been 11% year over year and \nexceeded the top end of our guidance. Operating income was $21.2 billion, up 61% year over year, and trailing twelve-month free cash flow adjusted for \nequipment finance leases was $36.2 billion, up $700 million year over year. We're pleased with the invention, customer experience improvements, and results \ndelivered in 2024, and have a lot more planned in 2025. I'll start by talking about our stores business. We saw 10% year over year revenue growth in our North \nAmerica segment, and 9% year over year in our international segment, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Our continued focus on expanding \nselection, lowering prices, and improving convenience drove strong unit growth that even outpaced our revenue growth. We continue to add to our broad range \ngiving customers choice across a variety of price points. We welcomed notable brands to our store throughout 2024, including Clinique, Estee Lauder, Aura \nRings, and Armani Beauty. We continue to add to the hundreds of millions of products offered from our selling partners, who made up 61% of items that we sold \nin 2024, our highest annual mix of third-party seller units ever. We also launched Amazon Haul for US customers in Q4, which offers customers an engaging \nshopping experience that brings ultra-low priced products into one convenient destination. It's off to a very strong start. In the fourth quarter, consumers saved \nmore than $15 billion with our low everyday prices and record-setting events during Prime Big Deal Days in October, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday around \nThanksgiving. Additionally, Profitero's annual pricing study found that entering the holiday season, Amazon had the lowest online prices for the eighth year in a \nrow, averaging 14% lower prices on average than other leading retailers in the US. Our speed of delivery continues to accelerate, and 2024 was another \nrecord-setting year for Prime members. We expanded the number of same-day delivery sites by more than 60% in 2024, which now serve more than 140 metro \nareas. Overall, we delivered over 9 billion units the same or next day around the world. Our relentless pursuit of better selection, price, and delivery speed is \ndriving accelerated growth in Prime membership. For just $14.99 a month, Prime members get unlimited free shipping on 300 million items, off the same day or \none day delivery, exclusive shopping events like Prime Day, access to a vast collection of premium programming and live sports on Prime Video, ad-free listening \nof 100 million songs and podcasts with Amazon Music, access to unlimited generic prescriptions for only $5 a month, unlimited grocery delivery on orders over \n$35 from Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh for $9.99 a month, a free Grubhub Plus membership with free unlimited delivery, and our latest benefit of a 10 \ncent per gallon fuel discount at BP, AMPM, and AMCO stations. When you think about this as a whole, and also compared to many other membership services \nthat are comparably or more expensively priced and offer just one benefit like video, Prime is a screaming deal. And we have more coming for our Prime \nmembers in 2025. We also remain squarely focused on cost to serve in our fulfillment network, which has been a meaningful driver of our increased operating \nincome. We talked about the regionalization of our US network. We've also recently rolled out our redesigned US inbound network. While still in its early stages, \nour inbound efforts have improved our placement of inventory so that even more items are close to end customers. Ahead of Black Friday in November, we'd \nimproved the percentage of ordered units available in the ideal building by over 40% year over year. We've also spent considerable time optimizing the number of \nitems sent to customers in the same package, which reduces packaging, is more convenient for customers, and less expensive for us to fulfill. And our per-unit \ntransportation costs continue to decline as we build out and optimize our last-mile network. Overall, we've reduced our global cost to serve on a per-unit basis for \nthe second year in a row. While at the same time increasing speed, improving safety, and adding selection. As we look to 2025 and beyond, we see opportunities \nto reduce costs again as we further refine inventory placement, grow our same-day delivery network, and accelerate robotics and automation throughout the \nnetwork. In advertising, we remain pleased with the strong growth on a very large base, generating $17.3 billion of revenue in the quarter, and growing 18% year \nover year. That's a $69 billion annual revenue run rate, more than double what it was just four years ago at $29 billion. Sponsored products, the largest portion of \nad revenue, are doing well, and we see a runway for even more growth. We also have a number of newer streaming offerings that are starting to become \nsignificant new revenue sources. On the streaming video side, we wrapped up our first year of Prime Video ads, and we're quite pleased with the early progress \nand head into this year with momentum. We made it easier to do full funnel advertising with us. Full funnel is from the top of the funnel with broad reach \nadvertising that drives brand awareness to mid funnel where sponsored brands let companies specify certain keywords and audiences to attract people to their \ndetail pages or brands to our Amazon to bottom of the funnel where sponsored products help advertisers surface relevant product ads to customers at the point of \npurchase. We also have differentiated audience features that leverage billions of signals from Amazon Marketing Cloud secure data clean rooms, providing \nadvertisers the ability to analyze data, produce core marketing metrics, and understand how their marketing performs across various channels. With our new \nmulti-touch attribution model, advertisers can understand how various ad types in their campaigns contribute to sales. Moving on to AWS, in Q4, AWS grew 19%\n\nyear over year and now has a $115 billion annualized revenue run rate. AWS is a reasonably large business by most folks' standards. And though we expect\ngrowth will be lumpy over the next few years as enterprises adopt and technology advancements impact timing, it's hard to overstate how optimistic we are about\nwhat lies ahead for AWS' customers and business. I spent a fair bit of time thinking several years out. And while it may be hard for some to fathom a world where\nvirtually every app is generative AI-infused, with inference being a core building block just like compute, storage, and database, and most companies having their\nown agents that accomplish various tasks interact with one another, this is the world we're thinking about all the time. And we continue to believe that this world\nwill mostly be built on top of the cloud with the largest portion of it on AWS. To best help customers realize this future, you need powerful capabilities of all three\nlayers of the stack. At the bottom layer, for those building models, you need compelling chips. Chips are the key ingredient in the compute that drives training and\ninference. Most AI compute has been driven by NVIDIA chips, and we obviously have a deep partnership with NVIDIA and will for as long as we can see into the\nfuture. However, there aren't that many generative AI applications of large scale yet, and when you get there, as we have with apps like Alexa and Rufus, cost\ncan get steep quickly. Customers want better price performance, and it's why we built our own custom AI silicon. Tranium 2 just launched at our AWS reInvent\nconference in December, E2 instances with these chips are typically 30 to 40 percent more price per form than other current GPU-powered instances available.\nThat's very compelling at scale. Several technically capable companies like Adobe, Databricks, Poolside, and Qualcomm have seen impressive results in early\ntesting of Tranium 2. It's also why you're seeing Anthropic build its future frontier models on Tranium 2. We're collaborating with Anthropic to build project right\nnear. A cluster of training and two ultra-servers containing hundreds of thousands of training m two chips. This cluster is going to be five times the number of\nExo-ZLofts as the cluster that Anthropic used to train their current leading set of cloud models. We're already hard at work on Training 3, which we expect to\npreview late in 25, and defining Training 4 thereafter. Building outstanding performing chips that deliver leading price performance has become a core strength of\nAWS's, starting with our Nitro and Graviton chips in our core business, and now extending to Tranium and AI. It's something unique to AWS relative to other\ncompeting cloud providers. The other key component for model builders is services that make it easier to construct their models. I won't spend a lot of time on\nthese comments on Amazon SageMaker AI, which has become the go-to service for AI model builders to manage their AI data, build models, experiment, and\ndeploy these models. HyperPOD capability automatically splits training workloads across many AI accelerators, prevents interruptions by periodically saving\ncheckpoints, and automatically repairing faulty instances from their last saved checkpoint and saving training time by up to 40 percent. It continues to be a\ndifferentiator with several new compelling capabilities at reinvent including the ability to manage costs at a cluster level, and prioritize which workloads should\nreceive capacity when budgets are reached. It is increasingly being adopted by model builders. At the middle layer, for those wanting to leverage frontier models\nto build Jet AI apps, Amazon Bedrock is our fully managed service providing high performing foundation models with the most compelling features making it easy\nto build a high-quality generative AI application. We are iterating quickly on Bedrock announcing Luma AI, poolside, and over a hundred other popular emerging\nmodels to Bedrock and reinvent. We've just added DeepSeq's R1 models to Bedrock and SageMaker. Additionally, we delivered several compelling new Bedrock\nfeatures to re-event, including prompt caching, intelligent prompt routing, and model distillation, all of which help customers achieve lower cost and latency in their\ninference. Like SageMaker AI, Bedrock is growing quickly and resonating strongly with customers. Related, we also launched Amazon's own family of frontier\nmodels in Bedrock called Nova. These models compare favorably in intelligence against the leading models in the world to offer lower latency, lower price, about\n75 percent lower than other models in Bedrock, and are integrated with key Bedrock features like fine-tuning, model distillation, knowledge base as a rag, and\nAgentec capabilities. Thousands of AWS customers are already taking advantage of Amazon Nova models' capabilities and price performance, including Palantir,\nSAP Densu Fortinet Trellix, and Robinhood, and we've just gotten started. At the top layer of the stack, Amazon Q is our most capable generative AI-powered\nassistant for software development and to leverage your own data. You may remember that on the last call, I shared the very practical use case where Q\ntransformation helps save Amazon Teams $260 million and 4500 developer years in migrating over 30,000 applications to new versions of the Java JDK. This is\nreal value, and companies ask for more, which we obliged with our recent deliveries of Q transformation that enable moves from Windows dot net applications to\nLinux VMware to EC2, accelerates mainframe migrations. Early customer testing indicates the queue can turn was going to be a multi-year effort to do a\nmainframe migration into a multi-quarter effort, cutting by more than 50% the time to migrate mainframes. This is a big deal, and these transformations are good\nexamples of practical AI. While AI continues to be a compelling new driver in the business, we haven't lost our focus on core modernization of companies'\ntechnology. We signed new AWS agreements with companies including Intuit, PayPal, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, Northrop Grumman, The Guardian Life\nInsurance Company of America, Reddit, Japan Airlines, Baker Hughes, the Hertz Corporation, Resin Chime Financial, Asana, and many others. Consistent\ncustomer feedback from our recent AWS reInvent was appreciation that we're still inventing rapidly in non-AI key infrastructure areas like storage, compute,\ndatabase analytics. Our functionality leadership continues to expand and there were several key launches customers were buzz about, including Amazon Aurora\nD SQL, our new serverless distributed SQL database that enables applications with the highest availability strong consistency, post-test compatibility, It's four\ntimes faster reason rights compared to other pop distributed SQL databases, Amazon S3 tables, which makes S3 the first cloud object store with fully managed\nsupport for Apache Iceberg for faster analytics, Amazon S3 metadata, Which automatically generates queryable metadata simplifying data discovery, business\nanalytics, and real time inference to help customers unlock the value of their data in S3, and the next generation of Amazon SageMaker which brings together all\nthe data analytics services and AI services in interface to do analytics and AI more easily at scale. As 2024 comes to an end, I want to thank our teammates and\npartners for their meaningful impact throughout the year. It was a very successful year across almost any dimension you pick. We're far from done, and look\nforward to delivering for customers in 2025. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.", "char_count": 14007, "word_count": 2247, "token_count": 2863, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "AMZN_TRANSCRIPT_2024_Q4_u_0001", "company": "AMZN", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2024, "period": "2024-Q4", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/AMZN/AMZN_FY2024_Q4.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}
{"doc_id": "AMZN_TRANSCRIPT_2024_Q4", "ticker": "AMZN", "quarter": "Q4", "filing_date": "2024-12-01", "phase": "qa", "speaker_name": "Brian Olsavsky", "speaker_role": "unknown", "speaker_firm": null, "utterance_id": "u_0002", "utterance_type": "statement", "text": "Thanks, Andy. Starting with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $187.8 billion, an 11% increase year over year excluding the impact of foreign \nexchange. This equates to an approximate $900 million headwind from FX in the Quarter, which is about $700 million higher than what we'd anticipated in our Q4 \nguidance range. Excluding that additional FX headwind, we would have exceeded the top end of our revenue guidance range. Worldwide operating income was \n$21.2 billion, our largest operating income quarter ever, and was $1.2 billion above the high end of our guidance range. Across all segments, we continue to \ninnovate for customers while operating more efficiently at the same time. In the North America segment, fourth quarter revenue was $115.6 billion, an increase of \n10% year over year. International segment revenue was $43.4 billion, an increase of 9% year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Worldwide paid \nunits grew 11% year over year, as our focus on low prices broad selection, and fast shipping continues to resonate with customers. Shifting to profitability, North \nAmerica segment operating income was $9.3 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion year over year. Operating margin was 8%, up 190 basis points year over year. In \nthe international segment, operating income was $1.3 billion, an improvement of $1.7 billion year over year, operating margin was 3%, up 400 basis points year \nover year. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter where we've seen year over year margin improvement in both the North Two thousand twenty-four also \nmarks the second year in a row where we've lowered our global cost to serve on a per unit basis. In the fourth quarter, we saw strong productivity in our \ntransportation network, from improved inventory placement, higher units per package, and reduced travel distances. We also saw improved productivity in our \nfulfillment centers. Overall, our teams executed extremely well throughout the quarter, and particularly during our peak seasons. I want to thank them for all they \ndo to deliver for our customers. Looking ahead, we have several opportunities to keep lowering our costs through even better inventory placement, which also \nallows us to deliver items to customers faster. In the US, we're tuning our inbound network and continuing to expand our same day delivery network. Globally, \nwe're adding automation and robotics throughout our network. While these efforts will take time to implement, and progress may not be linear, We have a good \nplan to continue to drive improvements in our cost structure. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North America and international\n\nsegments. This quarter, we saw strong advertising revenue growth on an increasingly large base. We will also continue to invest in experiences that have\npotential to be important to customers in Amazon long term. In areas like Alexa, health care, and grocery, as well as satellites in the coming months. As a\nreminder, we currently expense the majority of the cost associated with the development of our satellite network. We will capitalize certain costs once the service\nachieves commercial viability, including sales to customers. Moving next to our AWS segment, revenue was $28.8 billion, an increase of 19% year over year.\nAWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of $115 billion. During the fourth quarter, we continue to see growth in both generative AI and non-generative AI\nofferings. As companies turn their attention to newer initiatives, bring more workloads to the cloud, restart or accelerate existing migrations from on-premise to the\ncloud, and tap into the power of generative AI. Customers recognize to get the full benefit of generative AI, they have to move to the cloud. AWS reported\noperating income of $10.6 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion year over year. This is the result of strong growth, innovation in our software and infrastructure to\ndrive efficiencies, and continued focus on cost control across the business. As we've said in the past, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time,\ndriven in part by the level of investments we're making. Additionally, we increased the estimated useful life of our servers starting in 2024, which contributed\napproximately 200 basis points to the AWS margin increase year over year in Q4. Now turning to our capital investments. As a reminder, we define these as a\ncombination of cash CapEx plus equipment finance leases. Capital investments were $26.3 billion in the fourth quarter, and we think that run rate will be\nreasonably representative of our 2025 capital investment rate. Similar to 2024, the majority of the spend will be to support the growing need for technology\ninfrastructure. This primarily relates to AWS, including support demand for our AI services, as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and\ninternational segments. Additionally, we're continuing to invest in capacity for our fulfillment and transportation network to support future growth. We're also\ninvesting in same-day delivery facilities and our inbound network, as well as robotics and automation, to improve delivery speeds and to lower our cost to serve.\nThese capital investments will support growth for many years to come. Turning to our revenue guidance for Q1, net sales are expected to be between $151 billion\nand $155.5 billion. I'd like to highlight two items impacting our Q1 revenue guidance. First, we estimate the year-over-year impact of changes in foreign exchange\nrates based on current rates, which we expect to be a headwind of approximately $2.1 billion in Q1 year over year, or 150 basis points. As a reminder, global\ncurrencies can fluctuate during the quarter, and just as we saw in Q4 with the strengthening of the dollar versus most other currencies. Second, a reminder that\nwe are comping the impact of last year's leap year. The extra day contributed approximately $1.5 billion of additional net sales across our businesses in Q1 2024,\nor about 120 basis points to the year-over-year growth rate, which impacted all segments. Q1 operating income is expected to be between $14 billion and $18\nbillion. This guidance includes the estimated impact of certain updates to the useful life of our fixed assets. I'll provide a bit more detail in a moment, but on an\naggregate basis, we estimate this will decrease full-year 2025 operating income by approximately $400 million for the assets on our balance sheet as of\nDecember 31, 2024. First, in Q4, we completed a useful life study for our servers and network equipment and observed an increased pace of technology\ndevelopment. Particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning. As a result, we're decreasing the useful life for a subset of our servers and\nnetworking equipment from six years to five years beginning in January 2025. We anticipate this will decrease full-year 2025 operating income by approximately\n$700 million. In addition, we also early-retired a subset of our servers and network equipment. We recorded a Q4 2024 expense of approximately $920 million\nfrom accelerated depreciation and related charges and expect this will also decrease full-year 2025 operating income by. Both of these server and network\nequipment use for life changes primarily impact our AWS segment. Lastly, we also completed a useful life study for certain types of heavy equipment used in our\nfulfillment centers. And are increasing the useful life from ten years to thirteen years beginning in January 2025, we anticipate this will increase full-year 2025\noperating income by approximately $900 million. As we turn the page to 2025, we're energized by the great work our teams have delivered. We'll remain focused\non driving even better customer experiences, and we believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that,\nlet's move on to your questions.\nOperator\nAt this time, we will now open the call up for questions. If you would like to ask a question, we ask that when you pose your question, you pick up your handsets\nto provide optimum sound quality.

On the CapEx side, as Brian mentioned earlier, we spent $26.3 billion in CapEx in Q4. And I think that is reasonably \nrepresentative of what you can expect in the annualized CapEx rate in 2025. The vast majority of that CapEx spend is on AI for AWS. It's, you know, the way the \nAWS business works, the way the cash cycle works is that the faster we grow, the more CapEx we end up spending because we have to procure data center and \nhardware and chips and networking gear ahead of when we're able to monetize it. We don't procure it unless we see significant signals of demand. And so when \nAWS is expanding its CapEx, particularly in what we think is one of these once-in-a-lifetime type of business opportunities like AI represents, I think it's actually \nquite a good sign medium to long-term for the AWS business. And I actually think that spending this capital to pursue this opportunity, which, you know, from our \nperspective, we think virtually every application that we know of today is gonna be reinvented with AI in inside of it. And with inference being a core building block \njust like compute and storage and database, if you believe that plus that altogether new experiences that we've only dreamed about are gonna actually be \navailable to us with AI, AI represents for sure the biggest opportunity since cloud probably the biggest technology shift and opportunity in business since the \ninternet. And so I think that both our business, our customers, and shareholders will be happy medium to long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and \nthe business opportunity in AI. We also have CapEx that we're spending this year in our stores business, really with an aim towards trying to continue to improve \nthe delivery speed and our cost to serve. And so you'll see us expanding the number of same-day facilities from where we are right now. You'll also see us \nexpand the number of delivery stations that we have in rural areas so we can get items to people who live in rural areas much more quickly. And then a pretty \nsignificant investment as well on robotics and automation so we can take our cost to serve down and continue to improve our productivity. So that's the CapEx \npiece. I think the second question you asked, Mark, is really around AWS growth and whether this is being moderated down at all by supply chain constraints. \nWhat you know, it's it is hard to complain when you have a multibillion-dollar annualized revenue run rate business in AI, like we do. And it's growing triple-digit \npercentage year over year. It's hard to complain. However, it is true that we could be growing faster if not for some of the constraints on capacity. And they come \nin the form of, you know, I would say, chips from our third-party partners coming a little bit slower than before with a lot of midstream changes. It takes a little bit of \ntime to get the hardware actually yielding the percentage healthy and high-quality servers we expect. It comes with our own big new launch of our own hardware \nand our own chips in Tranium two, which we just went to general availability at reInvent, but the majority of the volume is coming in really over the next couple of \nquarters, the next few months. It comes in the form of power constraints where I think, you know, the world is still constrained on power from where I think we all\n\nbelieve we could serve customers if we were unconstrained. There are some components in the supply chain like motherboards that are a little bit short in supply\nfor various types of servers. So, you know, I think the team has done a really good job scrapping and providing capacity for our customers so they can grow.\nWe're still growing a pretty reasonable clip as I mentioned earlier.

You know, first of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what\nDeepSeq has done. You know, I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, you know, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement\ntraining, reinforcement learning being earlier without the human in the loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning. We also thought\nsome of the inference optimizations they did were also quite interesting. For those of us who are building frontier models, we're all working on the same types of\nthings, and we're all learning from one another. I think you have seen and will continue to see a lot of leapfrogging between us. There is a lot of innovation to\ncome. And, you know, I think if you run a business like AWS, and you have a core belief like we do that virtually all the big generative AI apps are gonna use\nmultiple model types and different customers are gonna use different models for different types of workloads. You're gonna provide as many leading frontier\nmodels as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock, and it's why we moved so quickly to make sure\nthat DeepSeq was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker. You know, faster than you saw from others. And we already have customers starting to\nexperiment with that. I think what's, you know, one of the interesting things over the last couple of weeks is sometimes people make the assumptions that if you're\nable to decrease the cost of any type of technology component, in this case, we're really talking about inference, it's somehow it's gonna lead to less total spend\nin technology, and we just, we have never seen that to be the case. You know, we did the same thing in the cloud where we launched AWS in 2006, where we\noffered S3 object storage for fifteen cents a gigabyte and compute for ten cents an hour, which, of course, is much lower now, many years later. People thought\nthat people would spend a lot less money in the on infrastructure technology. What happens is companies will spend a lot less per unit of infrastructure, and that\nis very, very useful for their businesses, but then they get excited about what else they could build that they always thought was cost prohibitive before. And they\nusually end up spending a lot more in total on technology once you make the per-unit cost less. And I think that is very much what's gonna happen here in AI,\nwhich is the cost of inference will substantially come down. You know, what you heard the last couple of weeks out of DeepSeq is a piece of it, but everybody is\nworking on this. I believe the cost of inference will meaningfully come down. I think it will make it much easier for companies to be able to infuse all their\napplications with inference and with generative AI. And I think it's gonna if you run a business like we do, where we wanna make it as easy as possible for\ncustomers be successful building customer experiences on top of our various infrastructure services, the cost of inference coming down is gonna be very positive\nfor customers and for our business.\nOperator\nAnd the next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.

Sure, Doug. Thanks for your question. First on AWS, yeah, we have seen a lot of fluctuation in operating margin AWS, and we've said historically that they\nwill be lumpy as you say over time. And, you know, the stage we're in right now, AI is still early stage. It does come originally with lower margins and a heavy\ninvestment load, as we've talked about. And in the short term, over time, that should be a headwind on margins. But over the long term, we feel the margins will\nbe comparable to non AI business as well. So, you know, we're very pleased with the strong growth focus on driving efficiencies in all of our data centers, saving\npower, reusing power in new generative AI applications, and just generally reducing costs. So very pleased with the performance of the AWS team, and I look\nforward to a strong 2025. I'll take the UPS one, which is, really UPS has been a partner of ours for many years, and we expect that that we'll continue to be\npartners with UPS for many years. As you know, increasingly over the last several years, particularly accelerated by the pandemic, we have shipped a much\nlarger percentage of our shipments through our logistics network, our own last-mile transportation network, and I think that's in part because we needed to scale\nup so fast in the pandemic with everything being shut down and needing to serve more of the total market segment share of retail units during that time. And\nneeding to do it at a low-cost structure because, of course, our customers expect low prices, and that's the nature of the business. I think UPS has decided that\nserving Amazon is lower margin for them. So I think they've walked away from some of the volume that they otherwise could have had in the partnership. We're\nable to handle it with our own logistics capability, and we'll see how it continues to evolve.\nOperator\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

Okay. Well, on the robotics piece, what I would tell you is, you know, since we've been pretty substantially integrating robotics into our fulfillment network\nover the last many years, we have seen cost savings, and we've seen productivity improvements and we've seen safety improvements. And so we have already\ngotten a significant amount of value out of our robotics innovations. What we've seen recently, and I think maybe part of what you're referencing in Shreveport, is\nthat the next tranche of robotics initiatives have started hitting production. And we've put them all together for the first time as part of an experience in our\nShreveport facility, and we are very, very encouraged by what we're seeing there both by the speed improvements that we're seeing, the productivity\nimprovements, the cost to serve improvements. You know, it's still relatively early days, and these all being put together are only in Shreveport at this point. But\nwe have plans now to start to expand that and roll that out to a number of other facilities in the network, some of which will be our new facilities and others of\nwhich will retrofit existing facilities to be able to use those same robotics innovations. I'll also tell you that this group of, call it, half dozen or so new initiatives is not\nclose to the end of what we think is possible with respect to being able to use robotics to improve productivity cost to serve a safety in our fulfillment network. And\nwe have a kind of next wave that we're starting to work on now. But I think this will be a many-year effort as we continue to tune different parts of our fulfillment\nnetwork where we can use robotics. And we actually don't think there are that many things that we can't improve the experience with robotics. On your other\nquestion, which is about how we might use AI in other areas of the business than AWS, maybe more in, I think you asked about our retail business. The way I\nwould think about it is that there's kind of two macro buckets of how we see people, both ourselves inside Amazon, as well as other companies using AWS, how\nwe see them getting value out of AI today. The first macro bucket, I would say, is really around productivity and cost savings. And, in many ways, this is the\nlowest hanging fruit in AI. And you see that all over the place in our retail business. For instance, if you look at customer service, and you look at the chatbot that\nwe've built, we completely rearchitected it with generative AI. It's delivering; it already had pretty high satisfaction. It's delivering 500 basis points better\nsatisfaction from customers with the new generative AI-infused chatbot. If you look at our millions of third-party selling partners, one of their biggest pain points is\nbecause we put a high premium on really organizing our marketplace so that it's easy to find things, there's a bunch of different fields you have to fill out when\nyou're creating a new product detail page. But we've built a generative AI application for them. Where they can either fill in just a couple of lines of text or take a\npicture of an image or point to a URL, and the generative AI app will fill in most of the rest of the information they have to fill out, which speeds are getting\nselection on the website, easier for sellers. If you look at how we do inventory management, try and understand what inventory we need in what facility at what\ntime, the generative AI applications we've built there have led to 10% better forecasting on our part, 20% better regional predictions. Our robotics, we were just\ntalking about the brains in a lot of those robotics, are generative AI-infused that do things like tell the robotic claw, you know, what's in a bin, what it should pick\nup, how it should move it, where it should place it in the in the other bin that it's filling. So it's really in the brains of most of our robotics. So we have a number of\nvery significant, I'll call it, productivity and cost savings efforts in our retail business. They're using generative AI, and again, it's just a fraction of what we have\ngoing. I'd say the other big macro bucket are really altogether new experiences. And, again, you see lots of those in our retail business ranging from Rufus, which\nis our AI-infused shopping assistant, which continues to grow very significantly. To things like Amazon Lens, where you can take a picture of a product that's in\nfront of you, check it out in the app. You can find it in the little box at the top. You take a picture of an item in front of you, and it uses computer vision generative\nAI to pull up the exact item in a search result. To things like sizing where we basically have taken the catalogs of all these different clothing manufacturers and\ncompared them against one another so we know which brands tend to run big or small relative to each other. So when you come to buy a pair of shoes, for\ninstance, they can recommend what size you need, even what we're doing in Thursday Night Football where we're using generative AI for really inventive\nfeatures like the sense of alerts where we predict which player is gonna put the quarterback or vulnerabilities where we're able to show viewers what area the\nfield is vulnerable. So we're using it really all over our retail business and all the businesses in which we're in. We've got about a thousand different generative AI\napplications we've either built or in the process of building right now.\nOperator\nAnd the next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with TD Cowen.

And we measure both what the conversion rate is of somebody who views a product\ndetail page with a faster delivery promise versus those that are slower as well as what we see downstream from customers once they've bought with a fast\npromise and what they end up buying throughout the year. And we have not yet seen diminishing returns of being able to continue to improve the speed of\ndelivery. It doesn't mean that there won't be instances in which people are happy to take products later. You know, we have a program where if people want to\npick a day during the week where they want to combine a bunch of their shipments and have it delivered then to be more sustainable and more environmentally\nfriendly, they can. And we have plenty of customers who choose that, but we time in and time out see that people choose to buy from us more frequently when\nwe're able to deliver to their homes or wherever they are much more quickly, and it leads to actually using us for more of their everyday purchases when we can\ndo ever more quickly. And I think that if you look at what we're doing with Prime, you know, the promise there is for a number of items that we'll be able to deliver\nitems to customers inside an hour.

And they're just using us much more frequently than they had before. The inbound network efficiencies, what I would tell you is, we made a\npretty significant architectural change in our inbound network that we've been working on for the better part of the year that we rolled out just a few months ago.\nAnd it's what we find when we make big architectural changes like this is that you tend to get some low hanging fruit efficient early, but then there's all sorts of\ntuning and refinement you have to do once you actually see it working live across the really vast network. And we have all sorts of ways here that where I think it's\nearly, and I think we're gonna get additional efficiencies throughout the year.
