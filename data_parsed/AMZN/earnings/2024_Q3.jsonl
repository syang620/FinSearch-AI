As always, we're focused on making our customers' lives better and easier and thinking long term with respect to how we can keep helping \ncustomers and build a successful business to outlast all of us. In our stores business, we saw sales growth of 9% year-over-year in the North America segment \nand 12% year-over-year in the international segment.

In the last few months, we've hosted our largest and most successful \nPrime Day and Prime Big Deal Days ever and helped customers save over $5 billion across more than 50 million deals. And for the second year in a row, we are \non track to deliver our fastest speeds ever for Prime members globally. We also continue to focus on lowering our cost to serve and are pursuing several \ninitiatives that we believe will have meaningful long-term impact in this area. First, we continue to believe there are more gains on top of what we've captured thus \nfar in outbound regionalization and getting more items closer to end consumers. As such, we're in the process of significantly changing the way we inbound items \ninto our fulfillment network and subsequently spread them to our regional fulfillment nodes. In the last few months, we've made hundreds of changes to our US \ninbound network and opened more than 15 inbound buildings. While still relatively early in this re-architecture, we've already improved our ability to spread \ninventory across our fulfillment centers by 25% year-over-year, allowing us to have more of the requisite items in fulfillment centers closest to the customer, so we \ncan compile shipments and ship to customers even more quickly. As we scale and optimize this new design, we expect these changes will further improve \ninventory placement, offer faster delivery time, save transportation costs, and enable us to increase units shipped per box. Second, we continue to roll out \nsame-day delivery facilities, which is not only the fastest way to get products to customers but also one of our lowest cost ways to deliver. Over 40 million \ncustomers this past quarter have had their orders delivered for free with same-day delivery, an increase of more than 25% year-over-year. And third, we continue \nto innovate in robotics to speed delivery, lower cost to serve, and further improve safety in our fulfillment network. We recently launched our 12th-generation \nfulfillment center design with the first building launching in Shreveport, Louisiana. This is the first facility that incorporates our newest robotics inventions that \nsimplify stowing, picking, packing, and shipping processes. Thus far, this new design reduces fulfillment processing time by up to 25%, increases the number of \nitems we can offer for same-day or next-day delivery and is expected to drive a 25% improvement in our cost to serve during peak within this next generation \nfacility. Though we believe we have more expansive automation and robotics than other retail peers, it's still early days in how much automation we expect in our \nfulfillment network. In advertising, we remain pleased with our progress, generating $14.3 billion of revenue in the quarter, 18.8% year-over-year growth. Our \nexpansive reach, ability to service relevant offers to our customers, opportunity to engage customers from the top of the funnel to point of purchase, and leading \ncapabilities around measuring outcomes at every touch point provide all types of brands with full funnel advertising at scale. With sponsored products, we're \nseeing meaningful growth on a very large base, and we see further opportunity in driving even better performance for advertisers by further improving the \nrelevancy of the ads we show and by providing additional optimization controls. At the same time, some of our newer offerings are in their very early days. We're \njust entering our first broadcast season for Prime Video advertising, following a very strong showing at upfronts. And we're continuing to support brands of all \nsizes with our Generative AI-powered creative tools across display, video and audio, including our video generator that uses a single product image to curate \ncustom AI-generated videos. While we're generating a lot of advertising revenue today, there remains considerable upside. AWS grew 19.1% year-over-year and \nnow stands at a $110 billion annualized run rate. We've seen significant reacceleration of AWS growth for the last four quarters. With the broadest functionality, \nthe strongest security and operational performance and the deepest partner community, AWS continues to be a customer's partner of choice. There are signs of \nthis in every part of AWS's business. We see more enterprises growing their footprint in the cloud, evidenced in part by recent customer deals with the ANZ", "char_count": 4640, "word_count": 738, "token_count": 919, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

And you can see how AWS continues to innovate in its infrastructure capabilities. With deliveries like Aurora Limitless Database, which \nextends AWS's very successful relational database to support millions of database writes per second and manage petabytes of data whilst maintaining the\n\nsimplicity of operating a single database or with our custom Graviton4 CPU instances, which provide up to nearly 40% better price performance versus other\nleading x86 processors. Companies are focused on new efforts again, spending energy on modernizing their infrastructure from on-premises to the cloud. This\nmodernization enables companies to save money, innovate more quickly, and get more productivity from their scarce engineering resources. However, it also\nallows them to organize their data in the right architecture and environment to do Generative AI at scale. It's much harder to be successful and competitive in\nGenerative AI if your data is not in the cloud. The AWS team continues to make rapid progress in delivering AI capabilities for customers in building a substantial\nAI business. In the last 18 months, AWS has released nearly twice as many machine learning and GenAI features as the other leading cloud providers combined.\nAWS's AI business is a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate business that continues to grow at a triple-digit year-over-year percentage and is growing more than 3\ntimes faster at this stage of its evolution as AWS itself grew, and we felt like AWS grew pretty quickly. We talk about our AI offering as three macro layers of the\nstack, with each layer being a giant opportunity and each is progressing rapidly. At the bottom layer, which is for model builders, we were the first major cloud\nprovider to offer NVIDIA's H200 GPUs through our EC2 P5e instances. And thanks to our networking innovations like Elastic Fabric adapter and Nitro, we\ncontinue to offer advantaged networking performance. And while we have a deep partnership with NVIDIA, we've also heard from customers that they want better\nprice performance on their AI workloads. As customers approach higher scale in their implementations, they realize quickly that AI can get costly. It's why we've\ninvested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference. The second version of Trainium, Trainium2 is starting to ramp up in the\nnext few weeks and will be very compelling for customers on price performance. We're seeing significant interest in these chips, and we've gone back to our\nmanufacturing partners multiple times to produce much more than we'd originally planned. We also continue to see increasingly more model builders standardize\nan Amazon SageMaker, our service that makes it much easier to manage your AI data, build models, experiment, and deploy to production. This team continues\nto add features at a rapid clip punctuated by SageMaker's unique hyperpod capability, which automatically splits training workloads across more than 1,000 AI\naccelerators, prevents interruptions by periodically saving checkpoints, and automatically repairing faulty instances from their last saved checkpoint and saving\ntraining time by up to 40%. At the middle layer where teams want to leverage an existing foundation model customized with their data and then have features to\ndeploy high-quality Generative AI applications, Amazon Bedrock has the broadest selection of leading foundation models and most compelling modules for key\ncapabilities like model valuation, guardrails, rag and agents. Recently, we've added Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, Meta's Llama 3.2 models, Mistral's\nLarge 2 models and multiple stability AI models. We also continue to see teams use multiple model types from different model providers and multiple model sizes\nin the same application. There's mucking orchestration required to make this happen. And part of what makes Bedrock so appealing to customers and why it has\nso much traction is that Bedrock makes this much easier. Customers have many other requests, access to even more models, making prompt management\neasier, further optimizing inference costs, and our Bedrock team is hard at work making this happen. At the application or top layer, we're continuing to see strong\nadoption of Amazon Q, the most capable Generative AI-powered assistant for software development and to leverage your own data. Q has the highest reported\ncode acceptance rates in the industry for multiline code suggestions. The team has added all sorts of capabilities in the last few months, but the very practical use\ncase recently shared where Q Transform saved Amazon's teams $260 million and 4,500 developer years in migrating over 30,000 applications to new versions of\nthe Java JDK as excited developers and prompted them to ask how else we could help them with tedious and painful transformations. Spend a few minutes\nreading developer forums about what they wish they could move away from, and you'll get an idea of what they want. Expect more practical AI game changers\nfrom Q. We're also using Generative AI pervasively across Amazon's other businesses with hundreds of apps in development or launched. For consumers, we've\nexpanded Rufus, our Generative AI-powered expert shopping assistant to the UK, India, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Canada. And in the US, we've added\nmore personalization, the ability to better narrow customer intent and real-time pricing and deal information. We've recently debuted AI Shopping Guides for\nconsumers, which simplifies product research by using Generative AI to pair key factors to consider in a product category with Amazon's wide selection, making it\neasier for customers to find the right product for their needs. For sellers, we've recently launched Project Amelia, an AI system that offers tailored business\ninsights to boost productivity and drive seller growth. We continue to rearchitect the brain of Alexa with a new set of foundation models that we'll share with\ncustomers in the near future, and we're increasingly adding more AI into all of our devices. Take the new Kindle Scribe we just announced. The note-taking\nexperience is much more powerful with the new built-in AI-powered notebook, which enables you to quickly summarize pages of notes into concise bullets in a\nscript font that can easily be shared. Speaking of Kindle products, we just launched a completely new Kindle lineup, the first time we've done a portfolio refresh of\nthis size. Apart from the Scribe, it includes the first-ever color Kindle, the fastest Kindle Paperwhite ever and a new pocket-sized Kindle. The early sales for these\ndevices have significantly outperformed our expectations, and Kindle is having an excellent year with customers reading more than ever. We now have over 20\nbillion average monthly pages read on Kindle devices worldwide. There are so many things we're energized by right now, but we'll quickly mention one more, the\nprogress we're making in improving customers' pharmacy experience. Brick-and-mortar pharmacies account for just over 90% of prescriptions dispensed in the\nUS that require customers to make trips to forlorn physical venues with much of the selection behind locked shelves, waiting lines for meds and only finding out\nabout pricing at the point of purchase. The largest mail order pharmacies offer delivery in 5 to 10 business days. We think customers deserve better. Today, we\ncan deliver to 95% of first-time Amazon Pharmacy customers in the US within two business days and to 20% of US Prime members within 24 hours. Next year,\nwe plan to launch operations in 20 new cities, so nearly half the US will have the ability to have their medications delivered to their door within hours. We believe\nmaking it easier for customers to get their medications will improve medication adherence, which we know can directly improve health outcomes. Across Amazon,\nwe have a lot coming in the next few months. We eagerly look forward to sharing these with customers, and a big thank you to my Amazon teammates around\nthe world for all their hard work. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.", "char_count": 8313, "word_count": 1322, "token_count": 1662, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

Let's start with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $158.9 billion, an 11% increase year-over-year, excluding a 20 basis point \nunfavorable impact of foreign exchange. As a reminder, our Q3 guidance had anticipated a larger unfavorable impact of approximately 90 basis points. Worldwide \noperating income increased 56% year-over-year to $17.4 billion, our highest quarterly operating income ever and was $2.4 billion above the high end of our \nguidance range. We remain focused on streamlining and managing costs in a way that allows us to continue inventing for customers in a cost-effective way. In \nthe third quarter, North America segment revenue was $95.5 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year. International segment revenue was $35.9 billion, an \nincrease of 12% year-over-year. Worldwide paid units accelerated to 12% growth year-over-year as our customers continue to come to Amazon for low prices, \nbroad selection and convenient fast delivery. Prime remains a core contributor to this growth. Year-over-year paid membership growth accelerated in Q3 from \nboth the US and globally, helped by our tenth annual Prime Day event in mid-July. Customers are enjoying even faster delivery speeds, which also helps drive \nstrong growth in items like everyday essentials. This includes items like health, beauty, and personal care as well as nonperishable grocery. Though all these \nitems often have a lower average selling price, the strength in everyday essential's revenue is a positive indicator that customers are turning to us for more of \ntheir daily needs. We see that when customers purchase these types of items from us, they build bigger baskets, shop more frequently and spend more on \nAmazon. We remain focused on keeping prices sharp and offering broad selection that gives customers options when making purchase decisions. Shifting to \nprofitability. Our North America and international segments each delivered their seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement. \nNorth America segment operating income was $5.7 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion year-over-year. North America operating margin was 5.9%, up 100 basis \npoints year-over-year. In the third quarter, we continue to make progress in improving our fulfillment network cost structure, driven in part by improved inventory \nplacement. This helped us drive better productivity in our transportation network and shipping efficiency from higher units per box. In the international segment,\n\noperating income was $1.3 billion, an improvement of $1.4 billion year-over-year. International operating margin was 3.6%, up 390 basis points year-over-year.\nSo far this year, we've generated operating profit in each of the three quarters for the international segment and totals $2.5 billion year-to-date. We're seeing\nstrength in our established countries like the UK and Germany as we continue to drive efficiencies to improve on-road productivity in our transportation network\nand better execution in our fulfillment centers. Our emerging countries are growing revenue at a healthy rate also, and they are leveraging their cost structures on\ninvesting strategically in Prime benefits. We have confidence that our focus on the inputs, coupled with the strength of our global teams, will continue to drive\nimprovement over time. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North America and international segments. This quarter, we saw strong\ngrowth on an increasing large base of advertising revenue. We see many opportunities to further expand our ads offering in areas that are driving growth today\nlike Sponsored Products as well as more recent growth areas like Prime Video ads. Moving next to our AWS segment. Revenue was $27.5 billion, an increase of\n19.1% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. AWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of $110 billion. The business continues to grow,\nmostly opportunity to expand our core cloud offering and our AI services. Customers increasingly recognize that to get the true benefit of Generative AI, they also\nneed to move to the cloud. AWS operating income was $10.4 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion year-over-year as a result of our continued focus on cost control,\nincluding a measured pace of hiring, a focus on driving efficiencies in our infrastructure, and reducing costs across the business. Additionally, we increased the\nestimated useful life of our servers starting in 2024, which contributed approximately 200 basis points to the AWS margin increase year-over-year in Q3. As we\nsaid in the past, we expect the AWS operating margins to fluctuate, driven in part by the level of investments we're making at any point in time. Now turning to our\ncapital investments. As a reminder, we define these as a combination of cash CapEx plus equipment finance leases. Year-to-date capital investments were $51.9\nbillion. We expect to spend approximately $75 billion in CapEx in 2024. The majority of the spend is to support the growing need for technology infrastructure.\nThis primarily relates to AWS as we invest to support demand for our AI services while also including technology infrastructure to support our North America and\ninternational segments. Additionally, we're continuing to invest in our fulfillment and transportation network to support the growth of the business, improve delivery\nspeeds and lower our cost to serve. This includes investments in same-day delivery facilities, in our inbound network and as well in robotics and automation.\nWe're encouraged by the start of the holiday season, which kicked off in October with a strong Prime Big Deal Days. We are ready to serve customers throughout\nthe season, and I want to thank our teams across Amazon for delivering two very large Prime member events in the past four months and for getting us ready to\ndelight customers during this holiday season.

Thanks, Doug. Let me start with AWS. Yeah, the primary drivers of the year-over-year margin increase are threefold. So first is accelerating top-line\ndemand. That helps with all of our efficiencies, our cost-control efforts and of course, what you just mentioned, I believe, the change in the useful life of our\nservers this year. Let me remind you on that one. We made the change in 2024 to extend the useful life of our servers. This added about 200 basis-points of\nmargin year-over-year. On cost-control, it's been a number of areas. It's -- first is hiring and staffing. We're being very measured in our hiring and you can tell as a\ncompany where our office staff is down slightly year-over-year and it's flat to the end of last year. So we're really working hard to maintain our efficiencies not only\nin the sales force and other areas and production teams, but also in our infrastructure areas. Infrastructure is a big part of our cost structure in AWS and we're\nprobably the best at matching up supply and demand and driving cost efficiencies and driving those operations very, very strongly. And I think you saw that this\nquarter, especially on the higher-volume. And over-time, this margin will fluctuate in the segment. It's a number of factors to keep in mind, including our level of\ninvestment in the amount of innovation and product development we're doing for new products and services, changes in our staffing for sales and support\norganizations and of course, capital to support customer growth and to build cost performance chips for our customers' applications. So as I mentioned, we do a\nreally good job of matching supply and demand and we do that in this business, it can result in quarters that we just saw.", "char_count": 1735, "word_count": 298, "token_count": 368, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null}

As Brian said in his opening comments, we expect to spend about $75 billion in 2024. I suspect we'll spend more than that in\n2025. And the majority of it is for AWS and specifically, the increased bumps here are really driven by Generative AI. As I was mentioning in my own opening\ncomments, our AI business is a multi-billion dollar business that's growing triple-digit percentages year-over-year and is growing three times faster at its stage of\nevolution than AWS did itself. We thought AWS grew pretty fast. And so the thing to remember about the AWS business is the cash life cycle is such that the\nfaster we grow demand, the faster we have to invest capital in data centers and networking gear and hardware. And of course, in the hardware of AI, the\naccelerators or the chips are more expensive than the CPU hardware. And so we invest in all of that upfront in advance of when we can monetize it with\ncustomers using the resources. But of course, a lot of these assets are many year useful life assets. Data centers, for instance, are useful assets for 20 to 30\nyears. And so I think we've proven over time that we can drive enough operating income and free-cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested\ncapital business and we expect the same thing will happen here with Generative AI. It is a really unusually large maybe once in a lifetime type of opportunity. And\nI think our customers, the business and our shareholders will feel good about this long-term that we're aggressively pursuing it.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.

So some quick context, Ross. I think one of the least understood parts about AWS, over time, is that it is a massive logistics challenge. If you think about,\nwe have 35 or so regions around the world, which is an area of the world where we have multiple data centers, and then probably about 130 availability zone\nthrough data centers, and then we have thousands of SKUs we have to land in all those facilities. And if you land too little of them, you end up with shortages,\nwhich end up in outages for customers. So most don't end up with too little, they end up with too much. And if you end up with too much, the economics are\nwoefully inefficient. And I think you can see from our economics that we've done a pretty good job over time at managing those types of logistics and capacity.\nAnd it's meant that we've had to develop very sophisticated models in anticipating how much capacity we need, where, in which SKUs and units. And so I think\nthat the AI space is, for sure, earlier stage, more fluid and dynamic than our non-AI part of AWS. But it's also true that people aren't showing up for 30,000 chips\nin a day. They're planning in advance. So we have very significant demand signals giving us an idea about how much we need. And I think that one of the\ndifferences if you were able to get inside of the economics of the different types of providers here is how well they manage that utilization and that capacity. It has\na very direct impact on what kind of margins you have over time and what kind of capital efficiency you also have over time. And so I think you're right, Ross, that\nthere are some similarities in the early days here of AI, where the offerings are new and people are very excited about it. It's moving very quickly and the margins\nare lower than what they -- I think they will be over time. The same was true with AWS. If you looked at our margins around the time you were citing, in 2010, they\nwere pretty different than they are now. I think as the market matures over time, there are going to be very healthy margins here in the Generative AI space.\nOperator\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

Let me take the first part of that question on international segment profitability. So if you've looked at the trends, we see quarter-to-quarter\nfluctuations certainly in operating profit in the international segment. But we're starting to see clear trend lines that are moving positive and above zero. And for\neach of the last seven quarters, as I mentioned, we've had year-over-year improvement in op margin. And in the last quarter, operating income was up $1.4 billion\nversus the prior year. So really, it is a lot of the same factors you're seeing in North America, lower cost to serve, greater contribution from advertising, improved\nselection, faster delivery speeds, which help drive consumer demand. And if you step back further, international is really a mix of our established countries where\nwe've been operating for a long time, the UK, Europe, and Germany -- excuse me, Europe and Japan, and a number of emerging countries, including 10 new\ncountries that we launched in the last seven years. So there's a lot under the hood there and there's different stories in each country. Each of them is on a\ndifferent point in the path from launching to customer adoption, just scaling towards profitability to then making consistent operating profit. So I think our\nexpectations in each of those countries mirror those in North America. And we intend, over the fullness of time, that we're going to aim for North America margins,\nwhich are not static themselves. So we're happy with the performance. Glad to see a number above zero in many of the last few quarters, but really it\u2019s a story on\na country-by-country basis that we're working hard. On the robotics piece, what I would say is even though we believe we have more expansive and advanced\nautomation, robotics capabilities in our fulfillment network than other peers, it's so early with respect to what we're going to do automation, robotics-wise in our\nfulfillment network. We're just at the stage right now where we're starting to roll out. We had about a five or six very significant new robotics capabilities in the\nareas of stowing, picking, packing, and shipping that we are finally put into one facility to get the entire workflow. It's a facility in Shreveport, Louisiana that was\njust launched a few weeks ago. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we're seeing very encouraging results there. And of course, the reason why we're\ntrying to have more robotics and automation in our fulfillment network is it allows us to fast -- to ship more quickly, to ship more cost effectively, and to make\nconditions even safer for our fulfillment teammates than what they already have today. And I think something that the team has done in a very disciplined way,\nand I talked about this a little bit in my annual letter, my shareholder letter is just they have been very thoughtful about defining what are the primitive foundational\nbuilding blocks that you need, that you can then use in lots of different combinations to build additional automation/robotics capabilities down the road, so we can\nmove even more quickly with the next generation of robotics capabilities. And that team has invested in those and they're already working on the next generation.\nAnd the last piece I would add to that is we really do believe that AI is going to be a big piece of what we do in our robotics network. We had a number of efforts\ngoing on there. We just hired a number of people from an incredibly strong robotics AI organization. And I think that will be a very central part of what we do\nmoving forward, too.\nOperator\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.

Yeah, you're right. Q3 unit volume was strong, 12% worldwide. It's pretty similar in North America versus international.\nAnd the consumer factors, we've seen a continuation of many of the things we've discussed over the first -- or last few quarters. Customers looking for deals and\nare price conscious. This matches up well with our Prime events where we were -- which were well received and saved billions for our -- billions of dollars for our\nPrime members. It also led to Prime member -- paid Prime member growth accelerating in the quarter, which is hugely impactful for us. A lot of our best offers\nand deliveries are tuned to Prime membership, and it's the best deal in retail. So with all the benefits you get for the subscription price, so those are all positive\nsigns. When you look at the split between revenue growth and unit growth, you do see some impact of the lower ASP products that we're selling as well as some\nof the trade down that consumers are doing. But we take that as a real positive, seeing the growth in everyday essential categories, which are really predicated\non speed. So it's -- you have to have fast delivery to be able to sell the those products to customers. And when you do, it results in a stickier consumer\nrelationship, higher orders, building larger baskets, which help our ship economics, and repeat orders are stronger. So those are all positive signs, and we'll take\nany short-term degradation in ASP because what we're focused on primarily is free cash flow here. And we see the ability to unlock all new elements of the\nconsumer spend.", "char_count": 1627, "word_count": 286, "token_count": 345, "exchange_id": "ex_004", "exchange_role": "answer"}

There's an expression that we've used a lot of times over the years that it's easy to lower prices but it's much harder\nto be able to afford to lower prices. And the same thing is probably true about lower ASP items. It's pretty easy to choose to supply them but it's much harder to\nbe able to afford to economically supply them. And so one of the reasons that we have been so maniacal about cost to serve over the last few years is that as\nwe're able to take our cost to serve down, it just opens up the aperture for more items, particularly lower ASP items that we're able to supply in an economic way.\nAnd when you layer on top of that the broader selection, you layer on top of that faster speed and what we're able to do in getting items and fulfillment nodes local\nand close to our end customers, what we're able to do in expanding our same-day network, which allows us to ship same-day but also is one of our lowest-cost\nways is it just lets us serve so many more of customers' shopping missions.

Thanks for your question. On the first one, third-party sellers, yes, the percent of paid units was 60% in Q3. And if you look over the last two years,\nit's -- essentially, it was at 59%, stepping up to 60%, stepping up to 61% pretty much every second quarter. So what we're seeing is still in a tight band between\n59% and 61%. But what we're seeing is the impact of the everyday essentials. There's -- 3P demand is still strong and unit volumes are strong. It's just the\neveryday essentials tend to skew more to 1P than 3P. And on your second question, Colin, around Alexa, I think we have a really broad number of Alexa devices\nall over people's homes and offices and automobiles and hospitality suites. We've about 0.5 billion devices out there with a couple of hundred million active\nendpoints. And when we first were pursuing Alexa, we had this vision of it being the world's best personal assistant and people thought that was kind of a crazy\nidea. And I think if you look at what's happened in Generative AI over the last couple of years, I think you're kind of missing the boat if you don't believe that's\ngoing to happen. It absolutely is going to happen. So we have a really broad footprint where we believe if we rearchitect the brains of Alexa with next-generation\nfoundational models, which we're in the process of doing, we have an opportunity to be the leader in that space. And I think if you look at a lot of the applications\ntoday that use Generative AI, there's a large number of them that are having success in cost avoidance and productivity. And then you're increasingly seeing\nmore applications have success in really impacting the customer experience and being really good at taking large corpuses of data and being able to summarize\nand aggregate and answer questions, but not that many yet that are really good on top of that in taking actions for customers. And I think that the next generation\nof these assistants and the Generative AI applications will be better at not just answering questions and summarizing the indexing and aggregating data, but also\ntaking actions. And you can imagine us being pretty good at that with Alexa.\nOperator\nAnd our final question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.

I think pretty \nmuch everyone today has less capacity than they have demand for, and it's really primarily chips that are the area where companies could use more supply. And \nso we have -- we're growing at a very rapid rate and have grown a pretty big business here in the AI space and it's early days, but I actually believe that the rate \nof growth there has a chance to improve over time as we have bigger and bigger capacity. And I think that one of the reasons I mentioned in my opening \ncomments that we have a very deep partnership with NVIDIA. We tend to be their lead partner on most of their new chips. We were the first to offer H200s in EC2 \ninstances. And I expect us to have a partnership for a very long time that matters. It's also true that for customers that start to scale out their implementations on \nthe inference side, particularly, they realize pretty quickly that it can get costly. And it's really why we have pursued building Trainium and Inferentia, which is our \ncustom silicon. And the second version of Trainium, Trainium2 will start to ramp up in the next few weeks. And I think it's going to be very compelling for\n\ncustomers on a price performance basis. And we have a lot of customer interest. We have gone back to our manufacturing partners a couple of times now to\nproduce a lot more Trainium than we anticipated. Some of that, for sure, is due to the fact that we just -- we have very large demand, and we want more capacity\nand supply to be able to provide them. But a lot of it is that customers are excited about the price performance that they believe they're going to get in Trainium.\nSo I think it's a very significant opportunity for us in the AWS space, and it's going to be a very significant opportunity for customers. I think on the retail side, I'd\nstart by just saying that we've always believed that competition is very positive and very healthy. It's good for consumers, good for businesses. It's actually great\nfor innovation. And if you look at the retail space, it's a very, very large market segment. I mean, we have a pretty big retail business, and yet we're only about 1%\nof the market segment share of the worldwide global retail market segment. And still about 80% to 85% of that market segment share lives in physical stores. And\nso if you believe that equation is going to flip in the next 10 to 20 years, which we do, there's just a lot of opportunity not just for us but for several players. There\nwon't be only one successful player. I do think that we have some elements of our customer experience that are really unusual and unlike others. I think we have\nmeaningfully broader selection than almost all the players that you probably have seen and heard of. We have low prices with very significant deals that we go\nwork with our third-party selling partners around key holiday shopping occasions. And then we have very significant advantages and speed of delivery to\ncustomers. And we just continue to see in every bit of testing and analysis that we do, that the faster that we're able to promise customers that we can get them\ntheir items, the more frequently they buy and the more they actually use Amazon for their shopping needs. And so those are things that are pretty different. I also\nthink we have a way of prioritizing customers that I think is unusual. Our orientation, our DNA and our core at Amazon starts with the customer, and everything\nmoves backwards from that. Any meeting you go to inside of Amazon, we're always asking ourselves what do customers want? What do customers say? What\ndo they not like about the experience? What could be better? And that customer orientation is very important, not just in how you take care of customers, but the\nworld changes quickly all the time. And the technology is changing really quickly. And so if you have the combination of strong technical aptitude, propensity and\na passion for inventing and then also a customer orientation where it drives everything you do, I think you have an opportunity to continue to build great trust in a\nbusiness over a long period of time.", "char_count": 4246, "word_count": 770, "token_count": 906, "exchange_id": "ex_005", "exchange_role": "answer"}
