## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Doug Anmuth (JPMorgan)**: Thanks so much for taking the questions. Brian, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the drivers of the 38% AWS margins. I know you mentioned the
200 basis points related to the useful lives push-out, but just how to think about sustainability kind of in the 30s there going forward? And then perhaps related the
step-up in CapEx that you saw in 3Q, you gave the full-year number, which was helpful. Any kind of early read or thoughts on how we should think about 2025?
Thanks so much.

**Andy Jassy (CEO)**: Yeah, I'll take the capex part of that. As Brian said in his opening comments, we expect to spend about $75 billion in 2024. I suspect we'll spend more than that in
2025. And the majority of it is for AWS and specifically, the increased bumps here are really driven by Generative AI. As I was mentioning in my own opening
comments, our AI business is a multi-billion dollar business that's growing triple-digit percentages year-over-year and is growing three times faster at its stage of
evolution than AWS did itself. We thought AWS grew pretty fast. And so the thing to remember about the AWS business is the cash life cycle is such that the
faster we grow demand, the faster we have to invest capital in data centers and networking gear and hardware. And of course, in the hardware of AI, the
accelerators or the chips are more expensive than the CPU hardware. And so we invest in all of that upfront in advance of when we can monetize it with
customers using the resources. But of course, a lot of these assets are many year useful life assets. Data centers, for instance, are useful assets for 20 to 30
years. And so I think we've proven over time that we can drive enough operating income and free-cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested
capital business and we expect the same thing will happen here with Generative AI. It is a really unusually large maybe once in a lifetime type of opportunity. And
I think our customers, the business and our shareholders will feel good about this long-term that we're aggressively pursuing it.

And our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.

### Exchange 002

**Ross Sandler (Barclays)**: Andy, if I could push on that last answer, you talked about how AI is about the same size but growing way faster than early AWS. And if we look back at the 
market in like the early 2010s is hypercompetitive on pricing, your margins were below 15%, I believe, back then. And it seems like a lot of that is what's going on 
right now in AI with these new AI data centers where you've got competitive pricing and suboptimal utilization just in the whole industry. So as that revenue line 
grows from where it is today to tens of billions of dollars in coming years, how does that margin come on from the AI data centers versus your existing kind of

30-plus-percent margin at AWS? Any thoughts on how quickly you can close the gap and how that looks on the new AI workloads versus maybe this mid-30s that
the core business is running at? Thank you very much.

**Andy Jassy (CEO)**: Yeah. So some quick context, Ross. I think one of the least understood parts about AWS, over time, is that it is a massive logistics challenge. If you think about,
we have 35 or so regions around the world, which is an area of the world where we have multiple data centers, and then probably about 130 availability zone
through data centers, and then we have thousands of SKUs we have to land in all those facilities. And if you land too little of them, you end up with shortages,
which end up in outages for customers. So most don't end up with too little, they end up with too much. And if you end up with too much, the economics are
woefully inefficient. And I think you can see from our economics that we've done a pretty good job over time at managing those types of logistics and capacity.
And it's meant that we've had to develop very sophisticated models in anticipating how much capacity we need, where, in which SKUs and units. And so I think
that the AI space is, for sure, earlier stage, more fluid and dynamic than our non-AI part of AWS. But it's also true that people aren't showing up for 30,000 chips
in a day. They're planning in advance. So we have very significant demand signals giving us an idea about how much we need. And I think that one of the
differences if you were able to get inside of the economics of the different types of providers here is how well they manage that utilization and that capacity. It has
a very direct impact on what kind of margins you have over time and what kind of capital efficiency you also have over time. And so I think you're right, Ross, that
there are some similarities in the early days here of AI, where the offerings are new and people are very excited about it. It's moving very quickly and the margins
are lower than what they -- I think they will be over time. The same was true with AWS. If you looked at our margins around the time you were citing, in 2010, they
were pretty different than they are now. I think as the market matures over time, there are going to be very healthy margins here in the Generative AI space.

And the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.

### Exchange 003

**Brian Nowak (Morgan Stanley)**: Thanks for taking my questions. Andy, I have two. The first one, I feel like we talk a lot about your targets and sort of north stars for domestic profitability. Can you
talk to us a little bit about how you think about the drivers of international retail profitability from here and sort of how you -- just conceptually where the margins
could go and what drives them there? And then the second one, I wanted to sort of ask you more about the robotics that you mentioned. I know you've been
investing in robotics now for quite a few years. Where are you now in that journey? And how do we think about the next largest areas of investment in robotics in
the warehouse network? Thanks.

### Exchange 004

**Eric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs)**: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two-parter, if I can. Looking at the results in the commerce business, there's a clear sort of pattern emerging with respect
to ASPs versus unit growth. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of consumer behavior and the propensity to be receptive to either lower
ASP items or discounts among consumer behavior? And then the second part would be, can you talk a little bit about some of the strategic initiatives you're
building for the long term around capitalizing on lower ASP items and the potential shift to more consumables and the base of consumption habits on the
platform? Thanks so much.

**Andy Jassy (CEO)**: Yeah, hi, Eric, thank you for your question. Yeah, you're right. Q3 unit volume was strong, 12% worldwide. It's pretty similar in North America versus international.
And the consumer factors, we've seen a continuation of many of the things we've discussed over the first -- or last few quarters. Customers looking for deals and
are price conscious. This matches up well with our Prime events where we were -- which were well received and saved billions for our -- billions of dollars for our
Prime members. It also led to Prime member -- paid Prime member growth accelerating in the quarter, which is hugely impactful for us. A lot of our best offers
and deliveries are tuned to Prime membership, and it's the best deal in retail. So with all the benefits you get for the subscription price, so those are all positive
signs. When you look at the split between revenue growth and unit growth, you do see some impact of the lower ASP products that we're selling as well as some
of the trade down that consumers are doing. But we take that as a real positive, seeing the growth in everyday essential categories, which are really predicated
on speed. So it's -- you have to have fast delivery to be able to sell the those products to customers. And when you do, it results in a stickier consumer
relationship, higher orders, building larger baskets, which help our ship economics, and repeat orders are stronger. So those are all positive signs, and we'll take
any short-term degradation in ASP because what we're focused on primarily is free cash flow here. And we see the ability to unlock all new elements of the
consumer spend.

### Exchange 005

**Justin Post (Bank of America)**: Great. Thank you. Maybe a couple of questions. Just on the cloud, are you at all capacity constrained, and will the new Trainium or NVIDIA chips maybe even
drive sales growth faster? And then secondly and I know there's been some competition from some of the more traditional retailers growing quickly online. Maybe
talk about maybe the advantages that Amazon has with a fulfillment center distribution versus store distribution? Any thoughts on that? Thank you.

**Andy Jassy (CEO)**: Well, on cloud, Justin, what I would tell you is that we -- I believe we have more demand that we could fulfill if we had even more capacity today. I think pretty 
much everyone today has less capacity than they have demand for, and it's really primarily chips that are the area where companies could use more supply. And 
so we have -- we're growing at a very rapid rate and have grown a pretty big business here in the AI space and it's early days, but I actually believe that the rate 
of growth there has a chance to improve over time as we have bigger and bigger capacity. And I think that one of the reasons I mentioned in my opening 
comments that we have a very deep partnership with NVIDIA. We tend to be their lead partner on most of their new chips. We were the first to offer H200s in EC2 
instances. And I expect us to have a partnership for a very long time that matters. It's also true that for customers that start to scale out their implementations on 
the inference side, particularly, they realize pretty quickly that it can get costly. And it's really why we have pursued building Trainium and Inferentia, which is our 
custom silicon. And the second version of Trainium, Trainium2 will start to ramp up in the next few weeks. And I think it's going to be very compelling for

customers on a price performance basis. And we have a lot of customer interest. We have gone back to our manufacturing partners a couple of times now to
produce a lot more Trainium than we anticipated. Some of that, for sure, is due to the fact that we just -- we have very large demand, and we want more capacity
and supply to be able to provide them. But a lot of it is that customers are excited about the price performance that they believe they're going to get in Trainium.
So I think it's a very significant opportunity for us in the AWS space, and it's going to be a very significant opportunity for customers. I think on the retail side, I'd
start by just saying that we've always believed that competition is very positive and very healthy. It's good for consumers, good for businesses. It's actually great
for innovation. And if you look at the retail space, it's a very, very large market segment. I mean, we have a pretty big retail business, and yet we're only about 1%
of the market segment share of the worldwide global retail market segment. And still about 80% to 85% of that market segment share lives in physical stores. And
so if you believe that equation is going to flip in the next 10 to 20 years, which we do, there's just a lot of opportunity not just for us but for several players. There
won't be only one successful player. I do think that we have some elements of our customer experience that are really unusual and unlike others. I think we have
meaningfully broader selection than almost all the players that you probably have seen and heard of. We have low prices with very significant deals that we go
work with our third-party selling partners around key holiday shopping occasions. And then we have very significant advantages and speed of delivery to
customers. And we just continue to see in every bit of testing and analysis that we do, that the faster that we're able to promise customers that we can get them
their items, the more frequently they buy and the more they actually use Amazon for their shopping needs. And so those are things that are pretty different. I also
think we have a way of prioritizing customers that I think is unusual. Our orientation, our DNA and our core at Amazon starts with the customer, and everything
moves backwards from that. Any meeting you go to inside of Amazon, we're always asking ourselves what do customers want? What do customers say? What
do they not like about the experience? What could be better? And that customer orientation is very important, not just in how you take care of customers, but the
world changes quickly all the time. And the technology is changing really quickly. And so if you have the combination of strong technical aptitude, propensity and
a passion for inventing and then also a customer orientation where it drives everything you do, I think you have an opportunity to continue to build great trust in a
business over a long period of time.
