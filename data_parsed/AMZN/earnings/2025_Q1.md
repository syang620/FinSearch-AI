## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Ross Sandler (Barclays)**: Great. I think I'm going to leave the China questions to others, and focus on AWS and kind of AI. So, Andy, it seems like you've been bringing on a lot more P5
GPU instances since February from what it looks like to kind of support all these new AI workloads. So, how would you characterize in the first quarter and maybe
here in the second quarter, the kind of supply/demand imbalance that you talked about before around AI workloads? And when do you think that AWS will be in a
position to kind of capture enough AI revenue to drive acceleration? Is that something that could happen this year? Do you see that more like next year, given
your capacity constraints? Thank you very much.

**Andy Jassy (CEO)**: Thanks, Ross. I would say that we've been bringing on a lot of P5s, which is a form of NVIDIA chip instances, as well as landing more and more Trainium 2
instances as fast as we can. And I would tell you that our AI business right now is a multi-billion dollar annual run rate business that's growing triple-digit
percentages year-over-year. And we, as fast as we actually put the capacity in, it's being consumed. So, I think we could be driving -- we could be helping more
customers and driving more revenue for the business if we had more capacity. We have a lot more Trainium 2 instances, and the next generation of NVIDIA's
instances landing in the coming months. I expect that there are other parts of the supply chain that are a little bit jammed up as well at motherboards and some
other componentry. And some of that is just because there is so much demand right now, but I do believe that the supply chain issues and the capacity issues will
continue to get better as the year proceeds.

And the next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.

### Exchange 002

**Eric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs)**: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe I could ask a two-parter. First, in terms of strategy Andy, how do you think about positioning the company for the
medium term, given all the levels of uncertainty out there about how the global trade environment might shift in the coming months? What do you see as the key
strategic priorities that will allow the company to sort of be able to capitalize one way or another, depending on various elements of outcome? And how do you
prioritize those investments in the months ahead? And then with respect to the one-quarter forward operating income guide, is there anything in there from a cost
side that we should be thinking about as purely aligned with those types of investments against the trade landscape that might not repeat either later into this year
or next year? Thanks so much.

**Andy Jassy (CEO)**: Thanks, Eric. It's hard to tell what's going to happen with tariffs right now. It's hard to tell where they're going to settle and when they're going to settle. And so, a
lot of what we're thinking about short and medium term actually turns out to be what we think about long-term too, which is, how do we actually have the broadest
possible selection for customers at the lowest possible prices? And there's maybe never been a more important time in recent memory than trying to keep prices
low, which we're heads down, pretty maniacally focused on, and then get things to people quickly and take care of customers. And that is the heart of what we're
doing. And you can see different initiatives that we've taken within those priorities. We've done some forward buys of inventory where we're the first-party seller.
Our third-party sellers have pulled forward a number of items so that they have inventory here as well. And those are all -- we're encouraging that because we're
trying to keep prices as low as possible for customers. I think also, when you have as broad selection as we have, and we have much broader selection than
other retailers, it means that when you've got this continuity, like we may potentially have, you're better able to help customers find what they want, no matter
what those trends are. And I mentioned in my opening comments about what happened in the pandemic, and you can bet there are going to be things that we
don't anticipate that customers really value and want that are different. It could be as simple, by the way, as just favoring other brands that maybe people didn't
know about before, but where they have a more favorable price equation for customers. And I think when you've also got -- another thing that people forget is that
when you've got 2 million-plus sellers, they're not all going to take the same strategy if there ends up being higher tariffs. I mean, there are going to be plenty of
sellers that decide to pass on those higher costs to end consumers, but they're going to -- we have a lot of sellers in lots of different countries, and not all of them
are going to pursue the same tack. And so, I think when you've got larger diversity like we have, we have a better chance of some of those sellers deciding that
they're going to capture share, and they're not going to pass on all or any of those tariffs to customers. And so, I think customers are going to have a better
chance of finding variety on selection and on lower prices when they come here. And the last thing I would say is that we have been in a number of our
businesses, but just I'd say over the last 6 years or so, we have been diversifying where we produce things over a long period of time. We had, I would say, a
meaningfully higher concentration of where we produced components for AWS or devices in China than we have now, where we've diversified meaningfully over
that time. And we just thought that was wise to do so. And so, those are some of the ways that we're trying to make sure that we are protecting our customers
over the short, medium, and long-term. But it turns out that most of those are the things that we focus most on, which is really broad selection for ultimate choice,
really low prices, and very fast delivery.

### Exchange 003

**Justin Post (Bank of America)**: Great. Thanks. I'll go back to AWS. I know in the past you said revenues can be lumpy. Can you explain why they might fluctuate up and down if it's beyond just
capacity? And you see the competitors with some pretty good growth rates. How do you think about the difference there? Obviously, your dollar growth is very
good, but how do you think about the difference there versus some of your competitors? Thank you.

**Andy Jassy (CEO)**: Well, the first thing I would say is when we've historically said that revenue can be lumpy, we've been saying this well before what's happened with AI over the
last couple of years. And the reason for that is the sales cycle, particularly for enterprises. It's true for startups. What you really want is you want to have the type
of capabilities where startups want to primarily choose to run on top of your platform. And that's true. If you look in the startup space, the vast majority of
successful startups over the last 10 to 15 years have run on top of AWS. And it's unpredictable when those startups are going to find product market fit and grow
substantially. And it's hard for them to predict and even harder for us to predict. And the same thing goes on the enterprise side, but in a different way. When the
sales cycle on the enterprise side is that you spend time trying to convince people that they should move from on-premises to the cloud, and then that you have
the right solution for them. And then, you pick a set of projects that you get experience on. And sometimes they use systems integrators. Sometimes they use our
own professional services. Sometimes they're doing it themselves. Then there's a next tranche migrations. And those migrations just take time. And some
companies get through them really quickly and some companies take longer to get through them. And what happens a lot of times too, is that they get excited and
enthusiastic about the cost advantages and the speed of innovation advantages they get moving to the cloud. And what was supposed to be a smaller next
tranche turns into a much larger next tranche. And all of that has been true for a long time. It's very hard for us to predict because it really is contingent on what
enterprises, how they want to sequence it and resource it. Then you throw in AI, which has its own very fast growth cycle, particularly in certain types of use
cases. And those change. I mean, I'll give you just some examples. In the early days, of the earliest days, I should say, of AI, what you've seen the most amount
of has been initiatives that get you productivity and cost avoidance. And we've seen that from so many of our AWS customers. And we're doing a lot of it
ourselves inside of Amazon using AI. And then, you've also seen, I would say, large scale training with a lot of those are running on top of this as well, and as
Anthropic is building their next few training models on top of our Trainium 2 chip on AWS. And then, you've seen a couple of really big chatbots. And then, what
you've seen just in the last few months is really kind of the explosion of coding agents. And if you just look at the growth of these coding agents, the last few
months, these are companies like Cursor or Vercel, both of them run significantly on AWS, but just look at the growth of that over the last few months. You just
couldn't have predicted that sort of growth. And so, that's why it's lumpy. Sometimes you'll have very significant increases that you didn't predict and you couldn't
forecast. And then, they'll grow at a good rate, but maybe not the same rate before the next big kind of explosive growth. And I would tell you that everything I just
mentioned, what's interesting in AI is that we still haven't gotten to all the other customer experiences that are going to be reinvented and all the other agents that
are going to be built, they're going to take the role of a lot of different functions today. And even though we have a lot of combined inference in those areas, I
would say we're not even at the second strike of the first batter in the first inning. It is so early right now. And then, I would just say on how to think about relative
growth rates, you always have to -- the year-over-year growth rate is really only a function of the percentage growth on the base with which you are operating
from. And we just have a very meaningfully larger base on the technology infrastructure side than others. And so, when it's still think about 17% year-over-year
growth on a $117 billion revenue run rate, it's still pretty significant growth. And as I said, I think we could be doing more, more if we had more capacity and I
expect that the capacity to ease in the coming months.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.

### Exchange 004

**Brian Nowak (Morgan Stanley)**: Thanks for taking my questions. Hey, Andy and Brian. So, I have one for each of you guys. So, Andy, you have a very complicated retail business with a lot of
moving pieces to it. I imagine you have a lot of good data on what you expect demand to be over the course of the year and the holidays and things. As you kind
of step back and analyze the business and the tariff uncertainty, can you just sort of walk us through the one or two key areas operationally that you're most
focused on just to ensure that Prime Day, Thanksgiving and the holidays go as smoothly as they possibly can? And then, secondly, on Brian, just to kind of go
back to Eric's earlier question, as we think about the 2Q EBIT guide, are there any onetime costs or sort of tariff related costs in there similar to that $1 billion that
you called out in the first quarter? Thanks.

**Andy Jassy (CEO)**: Thanks, Brian. On the retail question, I would say that the areas that maybe we're most focused on to make sure we have not just a great Prime Day, but Prime
Day is just one event as you know, and so is peak. We're trying to be great all year long for customers. The obvious ones are making sure that we help our sellers
however we can, because there's uncertainty for our sellers as well. So, we're trying to make sure we provide a great experience. We're trying to make sure that
we have the right diversity of sellers and low prices for our customers. I think all that you have to also be very thoughtful around how much inventory you bring
into your fulfillment nodes at any one time, because you can imagine scenarios where either on your own when you're the first party seller or lots of third parties
want to get as much inventory in as early as possible trying to beat a deadline on what may happen. And if you end up with too much inventory in your fulfillment
network, it really slows down, your productivity and your ability to get things out as quickly as you want for customers at the cost structure you want. So, being
able to manage that thoughtfully, we've learned that over the years, and I think the team is doing a really good job of balancing that right now.

### Exchange 005

**Brent Thill (Jefferies)**: Thanks. On AWS, I'm curious if you could give us the backlog number? And Andy, to your point about many of these core workload still yet to come to cloud, can
you just update us on what you're seeing, are you seeing enterprise spring back, or are you seeing some confusion with AI clouding that transition and the timing
of that? Just give some perspective on what you're seeing on migration. Thank you.
