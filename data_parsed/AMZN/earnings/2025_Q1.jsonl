Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our\nCFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics\nand commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2024.\nOur comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, May 1, 2025 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual\nresults may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our\nfilings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional\ndisclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the\norder trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially\naffected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, tariff and trade policies, and\ncustomer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of\ngrowth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our\nguidance assumes, among other things. So, we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements.

{"doc_id": "AMZN_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q1", "ticker": "AMZN", "quarter": "Q1", "filing_date": "2025-03-01", "phase": "qa", "speaker_name": "Andy Jassy", "speaker_role": "CEO", "speaker_firm": null, "utterance_id": "u_0001", "utterance_type": "answer", "text": "Thanks, Dave. Today we're reporting $165.7 billion in revenue, up 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is \n$18.4 billion up 20% year-over-year and trailing 12 month free cash flow is $25.9 billion. We're pleased with our continued business progress, but more \nimportantly with our pace of innovation and additional improvement in our customer experiences. In our stores business, we once again saw strong consumer \nresonance in our continued work on selection value and shipping speed. Our broad selection offers customers choice across their shopping journeys. We \nwelcome well-known brands such as Oura Rings, Michael Kors, and The Ordinary, as well as a new shopping experience with Saks that offers a refined luxury \nassortment of fashion and beauty items from brands like Dolce&Gabbana, Balmain, Erdem, Giambattista Valli, and Jason Wu Collection. As always, we're \nworking to keep prices low. And with this being an uncertain moment for consumers, it's even more important than it typically is. In Q1, we held deal events \nworldwide to help customers save over $500 million across the Big Spring Sale in the U.S. and Canada, Spring Deal Days in Europe, and Ramadan/Eid Sale \nevents in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and UAE. Prime members will have more opportunities to save throughout the year including at our eleventh Prime Day \nevent in July. Over the past few years, we've made significant progress in making our fulfillment network more efficient and cost effective. We've shared many \ntimes that an important turning point was regionalizing our national fulfillment network into regional hubs. By stocking items closer to where customers live, we're \nable to deliver more orders faster often in fewer packages and at lower delivery costs. The next challenge was getting as many items as possible into these \nregional nodes. Our inbound network which is how we get items to each fulfillment center hadn't been architected to leverage this new regionalization structure. \nSo, we redesigned it and just rolled out a new inbound architecture that expands the share of products that we can place in each fulfillment center improving \ndelivery speeds and lowering our cost to serve. In the first quarter, we once again set new delivery speed records with our fastest delivery ever for Prime \nmembers around the world and we delivered more items in the same day or next day in Q1 than any other quarter in our history. Looking ahead, we'll continue to \nrefine our newly redesigned inbound network, build out our same day delivery sites and add additional robotics and automation throughout our buildings. You'll \nalso see us expand the number of delivery stations that we have in rural areas of the U.S. So, we can get items to people who live in less densely populated \nareas much more quickly. I thought I'd share a few thoughts on the prospect of heightened tariffs on our stores business. Obviously none of us knows exactly \nwhere tariffs will settle or when. We haven't seen any attenuation of demand yet. To some extent, we've seen some heightened buying in certain categories that \nmay indicate stocking up in advance of any potential tariff impact. We also have not seen the average selling price of retail items appreciably go up yet. Some of \nthis reflects some forward buying we did in our first-party selling and some of that reflects some advanced inbounding our third-party sellers have done, but a fair \namount of this is that most sellers just haven't changed pricing yet. Again, this could change depending on where tariffs settle. Amazon is not uniquely susceptible \nto tariffs. As it relates to China, retailers who aren't buying directly from China are typically buying from companies who themselves are buying from China, \nmarking these items up, rebranding and selling to U.S. Consumers. These retailers are buying the product at a higher price than Chinese sellers selling directly to \nU.S. consumers in our marketplace. So, the total tariff will be higher for these retailers than for China Direct Sellers. It's also sometimes easy to forget what \nAmazon sells. We're not mostly selling high average selling price items, but we certainly sell a bunch. In the first quarter, our Everyday Essentials grew more than \ntwice as fast as the rest of our business and represented one out of every three units sold in the U.S. and Amazon. Even if you exclude Whole Foods Market and", "char_count": 4451, "word_count": 726, "token_count": 910, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "AMZN_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q1_u_0001", "company": "AMZN", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2025, "period": "2025-Q1", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/AMZN/AMZN_FY2025_Q1.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

We also have extremely large selection, hundreds of millions of unique SKUs, which means we're often able to weather challenging conditions better \nthan others. When there are periods of discontinuity, substantial unexpected product trends emerge. Think about the pandemic, when items like masks and hand \nsanitizer became big sellers. When you have the broadest selection like we do and 2 million plus global sellers like we do, you're better positioned to help \ncustomers find whatever items matter to them at lower price points than elsewhere. Finally, when there are uncertain environments, customers tend to choose the \nprovider they trust most. Given our really broad selection, low pricing and speedy delivery, we have emerged from these uncertain areas with more relative \nmarket segment share than we started and better set up for the future. I'm optimistic this could happen again. Moving to a few words on Amazon Ads, we're \nworking hard to be the best place for brands of all sizes to grow their business. We are pleased with the strong growth on a very large base generating $13.9 \nbillion of revenue in the quarter and growing 19% year-over-year. We're seeing strength across our broad portfolio of full funnel advertising offerings that help \nadvertisers reach an average ad supported audience of more than 275 million in the U.S. alone. This includes our top of funnel efforts to drive brand awareness \nto bottom of funnel offerings where we measure outcomes at the point of conversion. Amazon Ads provides brands with tools to reach targeted audiences in our\n\nown entertainment properties such as Prime Video, Twitch and IMDB, in live sports such as NFL, NBA and NASCAR, audio content such as Amazon Music and\nWondery and of course in our store as well as many other external sites such as Pinterest and BuzzFeed. All of our audience and measurement capabilities work\nfor the ads we deliver across premium third party publishers through Amazon DSP and our secure clean rooms provide advertisers the ability to analyze data,\nproduce core marketing metrics and understand how their marketing performs across various channels. We continue to see a lot of opportunity to further expand\nour full funnel capabilities for brands. AWS grew 17% year-over-year in Q1 and now sits at a $117 billion annualized revenue run rate. We continue to help\norganizations of all sizes accelerate their move to the cloud, helping to modernize their infrastructure, lower costs and speed up innovation. We signed new AWS\nagreements with companies including Adobe, Uber, Nasdaq, Ericsson, Fujitsu, Cargill, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, General Dynamics Information\nTechnology, GE Vernova, Booz Allen Hamilton, NextEra Energy, Publicis Sapient, Elastic, Netsmart, and many others. It's useful to remember that more than\n85% of the global IT spend is still on premises, so not in the Cloud yet. It seems pretty straightforward to me that this equation will flip in the next 10 to 20 years.\nBefore this generation of AI, we thought AWS had the chance to ultimately be a multi $100 billion revenue run rate business. We now think it could be even\nlarger. If you believe your mission is to make customers' lives easier and better every day and you believe that every customer experience will be reinvented with\nAI, you're going to invest very aggressively in AI and that's what we're doing. You can see that in the thousand plus AI applications we're building across Amazon.\nYou can see that with our next generation of Alexa named Alexa+. You can see that in how we're using AI in our fulfillment network, robotics, shopping, Prime\nVideo and advertising experiences. And you can see that in the building blocks AWS is constructing for external and internal builders to build their own AI\nsolutions. We're not dabbling here. We're very intentionally giving builders the broadest possible capabilities at every level of the AI stack cost effectively to use AI\nexpansively across their businesses. At the bottom layer for those building models, our new custom AI chip Trainium 2 is starting to lay in capacity in larger\nquantities with significant appeal and demand. While we offer customers the ability to do AI in multiple chip providers and will for as long as I can proceed,\ncustomers doing AI at any significant scale realize that it can get expensive quickly. So, the 30% to 40% better price performance that Trainium 2 offers versus\nother GPU based instances is compelling. For AI to be as successful as we believe it can be, the price of inference needs to come down significantly. We\nconsider this part of our mission and responsibility to help make it so. At the middle layer for those wanting to leverage frontier models to build Generative AI\napps, Amazon Bedrock is our fully managed service that offers a choice of high performing foundation models with the most compelling set of features that make\nit easy to build high quality Generative AI applications. We continue to iterate quickly on Bedrock adding Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet hybrid reasoning model,\ntheir most intelligent model to date and Meta's Llama 4 family of models. We were also the first cloud service provider to make DeepSeek R1 and Mistral AI's\nPixtral Large generally available as a fully managed model. And of course, we offer our own Amazon Nova state-of-the-art foundation models in Bedrock with the\nlatest premier model launching yesterday. They deliver frontier intelligence and industry leading price performance and we have thousands of customers already\nusing them including Slack, Siemens, Sumo Logic, Coinbase, FanDuel, Glean, and Blue Origin. A few weeks ago, we released the Amazon Nova Sonic, the new\nspeech-to-speech foundation model that enables developers to build voice-based AI applications that are highly accurate, expressive, and human-like. Nova\nSonic has lower word error rates and higher win rates over other comparable models for speech interactions. The technology was also abuzz by the potential of\nagents. To-date virtually all the agentic use cases have been of the question-answer variety. Our intention is for agents to perform wide-ranging complex,\nmulti-step tasks by organizing a trip for setting the right temperature or music ambience in your house for dinner guests, or handling complex IT tasks to increase\nbusiness productivity. There haven't been action-oriented agents like this until Alexa+. It was a technology to build these agents a still quite primitive and\naccurate, and requires constant human supervision. We just released a research preview of Amazon Nova Act, a new AI model trained to perform actions within a\nweb browser, and it enables developers to breakdown complex workflows into reliable atomic commands like search, or checkout, or answer questions about the\nstream. It also enables them to add more detailed instructions to these commands, where needed, like don't accept the insurance upsell. Nova Act aims to move\nthe current state-of-the-art accuracy of multi-step agentic actions from 30% to 60%, to 90-plus percent with the right set of building blocks to build these\naction-oriented agents. And the very top of the stack of the applications, this past quarter Q, the most capable generative AI assistance for accelerating software\ndevelopment, and leveraging your own data, plus a lightening-fast new agentic coding experience within the command line interface that could execute complex\nworkflows autonomously. Customers are loving this. We also made generally available Give That Dudo with Amazon Q, enabling AI agents to assist multi-step\ntasks such as new feature development, code-based upgrades, or Java 8 and 11, while also offering code review and unit testing, all within the same familiar\nGive That platform. Our AI business has a multibillion dollar annual revenue run rate, continues to grow triple-digit year-over-year percentages, and is still in its\nvery early days. While there is good reason for the high optimism about AI, I conclude my AWS comments with the reminder that there's still so much\non-premises infrastructure yet to be moved to the cloud. Infrastructure modernization is much less actually to talk about the AI. The fundamental to any\ncompany's technology and invention capabilities to develop their productivity is speed and cost structure. If a company is to realize the full potential of AI, they are\ngoing to need their infrastructure and data in the cloud. I want to briefly mention a few other items. As I've referenced a couple of times, in Q1, we introduced\nAlexa+. Our next-generation of Alexa personal assistant was meaningfully smarter and more capable than our prior self, can both answer virtually any question\nand to take actions, and is free with Prime or available to non-Prime customers for $99 a month. We are just starting to roll this out in the U.S., and we'll be\nexpanding to additional countries later this year. People are really liking Alexa+ thus far. We are excited and honored to be part of a joint venture that will be\ncreating next-generation of the esteemed James Bond film franchise. We recently named the producer Amy Pascal and David Heyman to produce the next\nJames Bond movie. Additionally, just a couple of days ago, Project Kuiper reached a significant milestone by launching our first satellite into orbit, with more being\nlaunched soon, and we expect to begin offering service to customers later this year. I'm proud of what our teams around the world have delivered. We are excited\nabout what we are inventing and working on, as we speak. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian for our financial update.", "char_count": 9633, "word_count": 1567, "token_count": 1950, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "AMZN_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q1_u_0002", "company": "AMZN", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2025, "period": "2025-Q1", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/AMZN/AMZN_FY2025_Q1.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}
{"doc_id": "AMZN_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q1", "ticker": "AMZN", "quarter": "Q1", "filing_date": "2025-03-01", "phase": "qa", "speaker_name": "Brian Olsavsky", "speaker_role": "unknown", "speaker_firm": null, "utterance_id": "u_0003", "utterance_type": "statement", "text": "Thanks, Andy. I'll begin with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $155.7 billion, a 10% increase year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign \nexchange. This equates to $1.4 billion headwind from foreign exchange year-over-year in the quarter. Worldwide operating increase was $18.4 billion, \napproximately $400 million above the high-end of our guidance range. These results include one-time charges that impact North America and international \noperating income that I'll discuss in a moment. First, let's start with the net sales results for these segments. In the North America segment, first quarter revenue \nwas $92.9 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Our International segment revenue was $33.5 billion, also an increase of 8% year-over-year, excluding the \nimpact of foreign exchange. Worldwide paid units were 8% year-over-year. Our priority is to provide value to our customers across our businesses. In the first \nquarter, we held multiple deal events around the world, which drove strong customer engagement. We saw broad-based strengths across our key business \ninputs, including record delivery speeds for Prime members, enabled by improved inventory placement. Our vast selection gives customers choice across various \nprice points, particularly in categories like grocery, which includes everyday essentials. These are the items that people purchase most frequently. We partner \nwith millions of independent sellers from around the world. These selling partners are important contributors to our broad selection, and worldwide third-party \nselling unit mix was 61% in Q1, consistent with Q1 of last year. Shifting to profitability, North America segment operating income was $5.8 billion, and \ninternational segment operating income was $1 billion, with operating margins of 6.3% in North America and 3% internationally. As I mentioned earlier, during the \nquarter, we've recorded one-time charges related to some historical customer returns that have not yet been resolved and some costs to receive inventory that \nwas pulled forward into Q1 ahead of anticipated tariffs. Without these charges, North America and international operating margins would have been \napproximately 90 basis points and 70 basis points higher, with operating margins of 7.2% for North America and 3.7% for international. We are pleased with how\n\nour teams continue to execute and deliver for customers. In Q1, our newly re-architected inbound network drove productivity in our fulfillment and transportation\nnetwork, leading to better inventory placement and higher units per package, and as a result, lower delivery costs. Beyond Q1, we have a number of initiatives\nunderway to continue improving our cost structure, such as fine-tuning our inbound network, building out our same-day delivery sites, expanding our rural delivery\nnetwork, and adding robotics and automation to our facilities. Better inventory placement remains a top priority. Better placement drives more in-stock selection,\nreduces travel distances, and speeds up delivery. And having inventory in the right place at the right time increases the likelihood that multiple items can be\ncombined in a package, which helps reduce packaging and cost. Although progress won't always be linear, we have a good plan to continue to drive\nimprovement over time. Shifting to advertising, advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North America and International segments.\nAdvertising revenues grew 19% year-over-year. We're pleased with the accelerating growth on an increasingly large base. We're seeing strong adoption across\nour full-funnel advertising offering, as brands appreciate our ability to connect them with customers. We'll also continue to invest in other long-term opportunities.\nThese efforts have the potential to be important to customers and Amazon in the future, including Kuiper, where we had our first launch of our\nproduction-designed satellites earlier this week. And we'll be launching more satellites throughout the year. We're closely monitoring the macroeconomic\nenvironment, including the impact of tariffs. We're planning for various outcomes, and we've taken a number of actions to protect the customer experience. We're\ndoing everything we can to keep our prices low for customers in a way that makes economic sense. Moving next to our AWS segment, revenue was $29.3 billion\nin Q1, an increase of 17% year-over-year. AWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of more than $117 billion. During the first quarter, we continue to see\ngrowth in both Generative AI business and non-Generative AI offerings. As companies turn their attention to newer initiatives, bring more workloads to the cloud,\nrestart or accelerate existing migrations from on-premises to the cloud, and tap into the power of Generative AI. AWS operating income was $11.5 billion and\nreflects our continued growth, coupled with our focus on driving efficiencies across the business. As we've said before, we expect AWS operating margins to\nfluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of investments we're making at any point in time. We plan to bring on an increasing amount of capacity in the back\nhalf of the year. Now, turning to our cash CapEx, which was $24.3 billion in Q1. The majority of the spend is to support the growing need for technology\ninfrastructure. This primarily relates to AWS as we invest to support demand for our AI services, and increasingly in custom silicon like Trainium, as well as tech\ninfrastructure to support our North America and international segments. We're also investing in our fulfillment and transportation network to support future growth\nand improve delivery speeds and our cost structure. This investment will support growth for many years to come. While we primarily focus our comments on\noperating income, I'd like to point out that our first quarter net income of $17.1 billion includes a pre-tax gain of $3.3 billion, included in non-operating income, and\nit relates to our investment in Anthropic. This activity is not related to Amazon's ongoing operations, but rather the result of the conversion of a portion of our\nconvertible notes to non-voting preferred stock. Turning to Q2 guidance, as a reminder, our guidance considers a range of possibilities and takes into account Q1\nresults, trends in quarter day results, and expectations around the macroeconomic environment. Q2 net sales are expected to be between $159 billion and $164\nbillion. We estimate the year-over-year impact of changes in foreign exchange rates based on current rates, which we expect to be a headwind of approximately\n10 basis points in the quarter. As a reminder, global currencies can fluctuate during the quarter. Q2 operating income is expected to be between $13 billion and\n$17.5 billion. This estimate includes the impact of our seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense in Q2, driven by the timing of our annual\ncompensation cycle. The external environment remains complex, and as we have done throughout our history, we are focused on the inputs that we can control\nto protect the customer experience. We will work hard to remain the place customers trust for sharp prices, broad selection, and convenience. We'll remain\nfocused on driving a better customer experience, and we still believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders.\nWith that, let's move on to your questions.\nOperator\nThank you.

It's hard to tell what's going to happen with tariffs right now. It's hard to tell where they're going to settle and when they're going to settle. And so, a\nlot of what we're thinking about short and medium term actually turns out to be what we think about long-term too, which is, how do we actually have the broadest\npossible selection for customers at the lowest possible prices? And there's maybe never been a more important time in recent memory than trying to keep prices\nlow, which we're heads down, pretty maniacally focused on, and then get things to people quickly and take care of customers. And that is the heart of what we're\ndoing. And you can see different initiatives that we've taken within those priorities. We've done some forward buys of inventory where we're the first-party seller.\nOur third-party sellers have pulled forward a number of items so that they have inventory here as well. And those are all -- we're encouraging that because we're\ntrying to keep prices as low as possible for customers. I think also, when you have as broad selection as we have, and we have much broader selection than\nother retailers, it means that when you've got this continuity, like we may potentially have, you're better able to help customers find what they want, no matter\nwhat those trends are. And I mentioned in my opening comments about what happened in the pandemic, and you can bet there are going to be things that we\ndon't anticipate that customers really value and want that are different. It could be as simple, by the way, as just favoring other brands that maybe people didn't\nknow about before, but where they have a more favorable price equation for customers. And I think when you've also got -- another thing that people forget is that\nwhen you've got 2 million-plus sellers, they're not all going to take the same strategy if there ends up being higher tariffs. I mean, there are going to be plenty of\nsellers that decide to pass on those higher costs to end consumers, but they're going to -- we have a lot of sellers in lots of different countries, and not all of them\nare going to pursue the same tack. And so, I think when you've got larger diversity like we have, we have a better chance of some of those sellers deciding that\nthey're going to capture share, and they're not going to pass on all or any of those tariffs to customers. And so, I think customers are going to have a better\nchance of finding variety on selection and on lower prices when they come here. And the last thing I would say is that we have been in a number of our\nbusinesses, but just I'd say over the last 6 years or so, we have been diversifying where we produce things over a long period of time. We had, I would say, a\nmeaningfully higher concentration of where we produced components for AWS or devices in China than we have now, where we've diversified meaningfully over\nthat time. And we just thought that was wise to do so. And so, those are some of the ways that we're trying to make sure that we are protecting our customers\nover the short, medium, and long-term. But it turns out that most of those are the things that we focus most on, which is really broad selection for ultimate choice,\nreally low prices, and very fast delivery.", "char_count": 3263, "word_count": 593, "token_count": 714, "exchange_id": "ex_002", "exchange_role": "answer", "chunk_id": "AMZN_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q1_u_0007", "company": "AMZN", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2025, "period": "2025-Q1", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/AMZN/AMZN_FY2025_Q1.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

And the reason for that is the sales cycle, particularly for enterprises. It's true for startups. What you really want is you want to have the type\nof capabilities where startups want to primarily choose to run on top of your platform. And that's true. If you look in the startup space, the vast majority of\nsuccessful startups over the last 10 to 15 years have run on top of AWS. And it's unpredictable when those startups are going to find product market fit and grow\nsubstantially. And it's hard for them to predict and even harder for us to predict. And the same thing goes on the enterprise side, but in a different way. When the\nsales cycle on the enterprise side is that you spend time trying to convince people that they should move from on-premises to the cloud, and then that you have\nthe right solution for them. And then, you pick a set of projects that you get experience on. And sometimes they use systems integrators. Sometimes they use our\nown professional services. Sometimes they're doing it themselves. Then there's a next tranche migrations. And those migrations just take time. And some\ncompanies get through them really quickly and some companies take longer to get through them. And what happens a lot of times too, is that they get excited and\nenthusiastic about the cost advantages and the speed of innovation advantages they get moving to the cloud. And what was supposed to be a smaller next\ntranche turns into a much larger next tranche. And all of that has been true for a long time. It's very hard for us to predict because it really is contingent on what\nenterprises, how they want to sequence it and resource it. Then you throw in AI, which has its own very fast growth cycle, particularly in certain types of use\ncases. And those change. I mean, I'll give you just some examples. In the early days, of the earliest days, I should say, of AI, what you've seen the most amount\nof has been initiatives that get you productivity and cost avoidance. And we've seen that from so many of our AWS customers. And we're doing a lot of it\nourselves inside of Amazon using AI. And then, you've also seen, I would say, large scale training with a lot of those are running on top of this as well, and as\nAnthropic is building their next few training models on top of our Trainium 2 chip on AWS. And then, you've seen a couple of really big chatbots. And then, what\nyou've seen just in the last few months is really kind of the explosion of coding agents. And if you just look at the growth of these coding agents, the last few\nmonths, these are companies like Cursor or Vercel, both of them run significantly on AWS, but just look at the growth of that over the last few months. You just\ncouldn't have predicted that sort of growth. And so, that's why it's lumpy. Sometimes you'll have very significant increases that you didn't predict and you couldn't\nforecast. And then, they'll grow at a good rate, but maybe not the same rate before the next big kind of explosive growth. And I would tell you that everything I just\nmentioned, what's interesting in AI is that we still haven't gotten to all the other customer experiences that are going to be reinvented and all the other agents that\nare going to be built, they're going to take the role of a lot of different functions today. And even though we have a lot of combined inference in those areas, I\nwould say we're not even at the second strike of the first batter in the first inning. It is so early right now. And then, I would just say on how to think about relative\ngrowth rates, you always have to -- the year-over-year growth rate is really only a function of the percentage growth on the base with which you are operating\nfrom. And we just have a very meaningfully larger base on the technology infrastructure side than others. And so, when it's still think about 17% year-over-year\ngrowth on a $117 billion revenue run rate, it's still pretty significant growth. And as I said, I think we could be doing more, more if we had more capacity and I\nexpect that the capacity to ease in the coming months.\n\nOperator\nThank you.

I'll take your first question. We did a strong quarter in AWS, as you mentioned, the margin performance. I would attribute it to the strong growth\nthat we're seeing coupled with the impact of some continued investment we're making in innovation and technology, give you some examples. So, we invest in\nsoftware and process improvements and it ends up optimizing our server capacity, which helps our infrastructure cost. We've been developing more efficient\nnetwork using our low cost custom networking gear. We're working to maximize the power usage in our existing data centers, which both lowers our costs and\nalso reclaims power for other newer workloads. And we're also seeing the impact of advancing custom silicon like Graviton. It provides lower costs not only for us,\nbut also for our customers, the better price performance for them. But you're right, margins are impacted by a lot of things, including our level of investment,\ncompetitive pricing, the mix of Generative AI services as they're ramping up will continue to evolve over the years to come. So, we do have a lot of investment in\ninfrastructure going on and planned for the second-half of the year. So, that will -- we'll start to see the impact of that.

And as I mentioned earlier, it is -- she's much more intelligent, much more capable, and able to take\nreal action. And to date, most of the agents that have been out there have really just been able to answer questions, which when it came out was very remarkable\nand -- but it's I think the future of agents is not just being intelligent, but also being able to take action. And that's actually, it requires a great model, but it also\nrequires the ability to sync that model and to align that model with being able to take the right action and execute and implement the right APIs or you can have,\nvery suboptimal results. And so, we've worked hard on that in Alexa+. We've been -- we started rolling out over the last several weeks. So, it's with now over\n100,000 users, with more rolling out in the coming months. And so, far, the response from our customers has been very, very positive. People are excited about\nit. I think that it does a lot more things than what Alexa did before. And we're very fortunate in that we have over a half billion devices out there in people's homes\nand offices and cars. So, we have a lot of distribution already, but there will be to some degree, there will be a little bit of rewiring for people on what they can do\nbecause you get used to patterns. I mean, even the simple thing of not having to speak Alexa speak anymore where we're all used to saying Alexa before we\nwant every, action to happen. And what you find is you really only have to do it the first time, and then really the conversation is ongoing where you don't have to\nsay Alexa anymore. And I've been lucky enough to have the alpha and the beta, that I've been playing with for several months. And it took me a little bit of time to\nrealize I didn't have to keep saying Alexa. And it's very freeing when you don't have to do that. And then, I think it's just experience in trying things. So, you can do\nthings like you have guests coming over on a Saturday night for dinner and you can say Alexa, please, open the shades, put the lights on in the driveway and on\nthe porch, increase the temperature five degree and pick music that would be great for dinner that's mellow. And she just does it. And like, when you have those\ntypes of experiences, it makes you want to do more of it. When I was in New York, when we were announcing, I asked her what were the -- we did the event way\ndowntown. I asked her, what was great Italian restaurants or pizza restaurants. She gave me a list and then she asked me if she wanted me to make a\nreservation. I said yes and she made the reservation, confirmed the time. Like that, when you get into those types of routines and you have those types of\nexperience, they're very, very useful. It is really like having a great personal assistant, which most people in the world don't have. And so, I think that the more\nand more that people get used to it, they will realize what she can do. And we're not going to be standing still. We have a lot more functionality that we plan to add\nin the coming months too.\nOperator\nThank you.

And the AWS question around what we are seeing on the workloads that haven't moved, what I would say -- the way I\nwould characterize it is that we were on a very aggressive March that was esthetical, but almost metronomic before the pandemic of enterprises deciding that\nthey wanted to move off their on-premises infrastructure, because of the speed of innovation, the developer productivity, and the cost advantages of the cloud.\nAnd then, when you got into the pandemic, and the economy was concerned in the second-half of that few years, we had everybody trying to cost-optimize,\nincluding us by the way. And then, as we started to emerge from that trend, you saw generative AI explode, and everybody wanted to try to find a way to have a\nworkload, or set a workload there, because people saw the potential, and it was also something that was generating a lot of interest publicly. And so, what we are\nseeing now over the last, call it, 16 to 18 months or so, is that enterprises realize they need to do both. And they want to do AI. Also to pilot at this point, AI, many\nof which will be successful, others will not be successful. The ones that are successful were scaled. But they also have a lot more initiatives that they still haven't\ngotten to on the AI side, either because the willingness skill set, where they're picking the first set to get experience with, or as they're waiting to see the cost\ninference continue to go down, which it will. I mean, you will not get the expensiveness that we all know is coming in AI until we keep getting the cost inference\ndown, even though it's going like crazy right now. But at the same time, I would say that we see an increased resurgence, and understanding for enterprises that\nthey're dropping the low-hanging fruit if they don't move their infrastructure to the cloud, for all the reasons I mentioned earlier. So, you're starting to see those\nplans pick up again. As I mentioned earlier to one of the questions, you know the side that you're going to transform your infrastructure from on-premises and\ncloud, and see it happen in there months. That is typically a multiyear process that some companies do it fast, some companies do it slower, but they do it\ncautious and they do it softly because they can't afford for their application not to work if they're making that transition. And we are having meaningful success in\nthose conversations, and in companies choosing to transform their infrastructure on top of AWS, and I think you'll see that moving forward too. Thank you for your\ntime joining us today, and for your questions. A replay will be available on the Investor Relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in\nAmazon, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\nOperator\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.
