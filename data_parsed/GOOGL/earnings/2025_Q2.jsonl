Good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a standout quarter for us with robust growth across the company. As you saw at IO, we are leading at the \nfrontier of AI and shipping at an incredible pace. AI is positively impacting every part of the business, driving strong momentum. This quarter, Search delivered \ndouble-digit revenue growth. Our new Search features continue to perform well. AI Mode has launched in the U.S. and India and is going well, while AI Overviews \nnow has over 2 billion monthly users across more than 200 countries and territories and 40 languages. I'll give some more details on Search in a moment. We \ncontinue to see strong performance in YouTube as well as subscriptions, reflecting great momentum across these high-growth businesses. In the U.S., shorts \nnow earn as much revenue per watch hour as traditional in-stream on YouTube. And in some countries, it now even exceeds in-stream's rate. Cloud had another \ngreat quarter of strong growth in revenues, backlog and profitability. Its annual revenue run rate is now more than $50 billion. We are seeing significant demand \nfor our comprehensive AI product portfolio. Of course, this is all possible because of the long-term investments we have made in our differentiated full stack \napproach to AI. This spans AI infrastructure, world-class research, models and tooling and our products and platforms that brings AI to people all over the world. \nI'll briefly touch on the AI stack before turning to quarterly highlights. First, AI infrastructure. We operate the leading global network of AI-optimized data centers \nand cloud regions. We also offer the industry's widest range of TPUs and GPUs along with storage and software built on top. That's why nearly all GenAI unicorns \nuse Google Cloud. And that's why a growing number, including leading AI research labs like Safe Superintelligence and Physical Intelligence use TPU \nspecifically. Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand from cloud customers. Next, world-class AI research, including models \nand tooling. We continue to expand our Gemini 2.5 family of hybrid reasoning models, which provide industry-leading performance in nearly every major \nbenchmark. In addition to improving our popular workhorse model Flash, we debuted an extremely fast flashlight version. We achieved gold medal level \nperformance in the International Math Olympiad using an advanced version of Gemini with Deepting. We can't wait to bring Deepting to users soon. We have \nsome of the best models available today at every price point. Our 2.5 models have been a catalyst for growth and 9 million developers have now built with \nGemini. I also want to mention Veo 3, our state-of-the-art video generation model. It's been a viral hit with people sharing clips created in the Gemini app and with \nour new AI filmmaking tool Flow. Since May, over 70 million videos have been generated using Veo 3. And we recently introduced a feature in the Gemini app to \nturn photos into videos, which people absolutely love. It's also rolling out to Google Photos users starting today. Third, our products and platforms. We are \nbringing AI to all our users and partners through surfaces like Workspace, Chrome and more. The growth in usage has been incredible. At IO in May, we \nannounced that we processed 480 trillion monthly tokens across our surfaces. Since then, we have doubled that number, now processing over 980 trillion monthly \ntokens, a remarkable increase. The Gemini app now has more than 450 million monthly active users, and we continue to see strong growth in engagement with \ndaily requests growing over 50% from Q1. In June alone, over 50 million people used AI-powered meeting notes in Google Meet. And powered by Veo 3, our new \nshort video product in Workspace called Google Vids reached nearly 1 million monthly active users. This month at Samsung Galaxy Unpacked, we announced \nnew Android and AI features that are available on Samsung's latest devices. And we are really pleased with the growth in subscriptions, which got a boost from \nour Google AI Pro and Ultra plans. Now some key highlights from Search, Cloud, YouTube and Waymo for the quarter. First up, this is an incredibly exciting \nmoment for Search. We see AI powering an expansion in how people are searching for and accessing information, unlocking completely new kinds of questions \nyou can ask Google. Overall queries and commercial queries on Search continue to grow year-over-year. And our new AI experiences significantly contributed to \nthis increase in usage. We are also seeing that our AI features cause users to search more as they learn that search can meet more of their needs. That's \nespecially true for younger users. Let me go deeper on our new search experiences. We know how popular AI Overviews are because they are now driving over \n10% more queries globally for the types of queries that show them, and this growth continues to increase over time. AI Overviews are now powered by Gemini \n2.5, delivering the fastest AI responses in the industry. We also saw strong growth in the use of multimodal search, particularly the combination of lens or Circle to \nSearch together with AI overviews. This growth was most pronounced among younger users. Our new end-to-end AI search experience, AI Mode continues to \nreceive very positive feedback, particularly for longer and more complex questions. It's still rolling out, but already has over 100 million monthly active users in the \nU.S. and India. We plan to keep enhancing the AI Mode experience for users by shipping great features fast. That includes our advanced research tool Deep \nSearch and more personalized responses. Next, Google Cloud. We see strong customer demand, driven by our product differentiation and our comprehensive AI \nproduct portfolio. Four stats show this. One, the number of deals over $250 million, doubling year-over-year; two, in the first half of 2025, we signed the same \nnumber of deals over $1 billion that we did in all of 2024. Three, the number of new GCP customers increased by nearly 28% quarter-over-quarter; four, more \nthan 85,000 enterprises, including LVMH, Salesforce and Singapore's DBS Bank now build with Gemini, driving a 35x growth in Gemini usage year-over-year. \nOur models have served on our AI infrastructure, which offers industry-leading performance and cost efficiency for both training and inference. Along with our AI \naccelerators, we introduced new innovations in storage, including Anywhere Cache, which improves inference latency by up to 70% and rapid storage, which \ndelivers a 5x improvement in latency compared to leading hyperscalers. In addition, we have optimized AI software packages, including PyTorch and JAX with full \nopen source supports for various AI training and serving demands. We've also integrated AI agents deeply into each of our cloud products. Wayfair is leveraging \nour databases integrated with AI to streamline data pipelines and deliver more personalized customer experiences. Vantel is leveraging our Gemini-powered data \nagents and BigQuery to review and act on product feedback more quickly. Target is using our Gemini-powered threat intelligence and security operations agents \nto improve cybersecurity. Capgemini is utilizing our AI software engineering agents to deliver higher- quality software faster by automating tasks from code \ngeneration to testing. And BBVA says Gemini and Google Workspace is saving employees nearly 3 hours per week by automating repetitive tasks. It's now rolling\n\nit out to 100,000 employees globally. We are also focused on building a flourishing AI agent ecosystem. We introduced an open source agent development kit,\nwhich now has over 1 million downloads in less than 4 months. We also introduced Agentspace, an open and interoperable enterprise chat search and agent\nplatform. Gordon Food Service is bringing Agentspace to its U.S. employees, which is enabling better, more efficient decision-making. And over 1 million\nsubscriptions have been booked for Agentspace ahead of its general availability. Turning now to YouTube. Nielsen data shows YouTube has led U.S. streaming\nwatch time for over 2 years. A generation that grew up with YouTube on their devices is now increasingly watching their favorite creators and content on their\ntelevisions. That includes billions of sports fans, too. Globally, they consume more than 40 billion hours of sports content on YouTube annually. And in\nSeptember, we'll stream the NFL's first Friday game of the season, live from Brazil. From sports to shorts, we now average over 200 billion daily views on\nYouTube Shorts. AI is helping improve our recommendations and auto dubbing, which translates to better returns for creators and brands by dramatically\nincreasing the potential audiences they can reach. And today, we began rolling out a whole draft of new AI tools for creators on YouTube Shorts. Finally,\nYouTube continues to diversify its subscription options, recently expanding its premium light offerings to 15 new countries with more to come. And lastly, Waymo\ncontinues to scale and expand to safely serve more riders in more places. Last month, Waymo launched in Atlanta, more than doubled its Austin service territory\nand expanded its Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Area territories by approximately 50%. Waymo also launched teen accounts, starting with riders aged 14 to\n17 in Phoenix. Overall, great momentum here. The Waymo driver has now autonomously driven over 100 million miles on public roads. And the team is testing\nacross more than 10 cities this year, including New York and Philadelphia. We hope to serve riders in all 10 in the future. As I said, a standout quarter.

I'll quickly cover performance for Google Services for the quarter, then structure the rest of my remarks around the great\nprogress we're delivering across search, ads, YouTube and partnerships. Google Services revenues were $83 billion for the quarter, up 12% year-on-year, driven\nby strong growth in Search and YouTube, partially offset by year-on-year decline in network revenues. To add some further color to our results. The 12% increase\nin Search and other revenues was led by growth across all verticals with the largest contributions from retail and financial services. YouTube saw similar\nperformance across verticals. It's 13% growth in advertising revenues was driven by direct response followed by brand. Starting with search and other revenues,\nwhich delivered over $54 billion in revenue for the quarter. Shifts like AI are what propels our industry forward. Gemini's native multimodality is helping bring the\noffline audio and visual world back into the online world, creating a number of opportunities for Search. Let me share a few examples. Take visual queries.\nGoogle Lens search is one of the fastest-growing query types on Search and grew 70% since this time last year. Majority of lens searches are incremental, and\nwe're seeing healthy growth for shopping queries using lens. And you can obviously take this to the next level by moving from image to video-based capabilities\nlike Search Live. And then there's Circle to Search, which is now in over 300 million Android devices. We've been adding capabilities to help people explore\ncomplex topics and ask follow- up questions without switching apps. For example, gamers can now use Circle to Search while playing mobile games to see an AI\noverview or answers. And just last week, we brought in new agentic capability directly into search for all U.S. users with AI-powered calling to local businesses.\nFinally, shopping, where in Q2, we introduced a virtual trial experience for search labs users in the U.S. Now people can try billions of clothing products on\nthemselves virtually. Early results and engagement have been extremely positive, particularly with Gen Z users and we'll be bringing this functionality to all U.S.\nusers imminently. All these innovations are opening up completely new ways for people to use technology, bringing the off-line world into the online world in ways\nthat simply have not been possible before. Add in our amazing AI translation capabilities and just imagine the possibilities. People can access more content in the\nlanguage and businesses, large and small, international or local can reach even more customers. I'm excited about how all of these elements will come together\nand the opportunities ahead of us in Search. Moving to ads where our strategy to reinvent the entire marketing process with AI is delivering value for our\ncustomers and our business. Last quarter, we introduced AI Max and Search, a new suite of AI-powered features in existing search campaigns. Advertisers that\nactivate AI Max and Search campaigns typically see 14% more conversions. On media buying, Smart Bidding Exploration, the biggest update to bidding strategy\nin a decade brings better performance to advertisers by allowing them to bid on a less obvious but potentially higher value queries more often.

As an example, Depop, Etsy's resell clothing marketplace used a short only demand gen campaign to drive new customers to the site. Short drove\n80% buyer brand load and double click-through rates versus benchmarks. On creatives, we launched Asset Studio using our latest models to help businesses,\nlarge and small, generate creative assets. Small businesses benefit from top quality assets and deployment scaling capabilities, but larger businesses can go\nfaster from proof of concept to launch and resize at lower cost. Over 2 million advertisers now use Google's AI powered asset generation tools to run ads, a 50%\nincrease on this time last year. Turning to YouTube, where we saw continued strong revenue growth driven by direct response followed by brand. YouTube\ncreators are connected to the global site guys and trusted by their audiences like no others. As part of Brand Connect, we launched Creator partnership hub,\nwhich allows brands to more easily work with the right creators and tap into cultural moments. We introduced Veo 3, photo to video and generative effects to\nshorts, making content creation easier and offering unexplored avenues for creativity. We're seeing both the volume and the price of ads and shorts increase,\nparticularly in developed markets. The feed-based nature of the product allows for more ad opportunities on average, and this growth is further supported by ad\nformats native to shorts, AI-powered ad creative resizing tools, improved ad targeting and the rise in viewer engagement. McDonald's U.S.A. harnessed the\ninfluence of YouTube creators to ignite awareness for the Minecraft movie meal. It leveraged YouTube Shorts partnership adds to increase its reach, generating a\n3.3x higher view through rate than the industry benchmark. Finally, on CTV where the momentum continues. According to the gauge report by Nielsen, YouTube\nhas been #1 in streaming watch time in the U.S. for more than 2 years, hitting a record high of 12.8% of total TV viewing in June 2025. In the past 12 months,\nYouTube ads viewed on CTV screens drove over 1 billion conversions. We saw strong growth in retail thanks to CTV shopping ads, which allows viewers to shop\ndirectly via QR codes, helping us leverage direct marketing opportunities. As always, I'll wrap up with the momentum we're seeing in partnerships, where our\ncustomers increasingly recognize the strength and breadth of Google's ability to help them transform their business with AI. For instance, a new partnership with\nPayPal will improve the digital commerce experience for their merchants and customers. PayPal will expand its Google Cloud adoption for AI-driven\nrecommendations, transaction processing and enhanced security. The partnership also broadens the availability and functionality of PayPal's payment services\nand capabilities across a range of Google products. In closing, I'd like to thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions and commitment to our success and to\nour customers and partners for their continued trust.

{"doc_id": "GOOGL_2025_Q2", "ticker": "GOOGL", "year": 2025, "quarter": 2, "filing_date": "2025-06-01", "phase": "prepared_remarks", "speaker_name": "Anat Ashkenazi", "speaker_role": "Unknown", "speaker_firm": null, "utterance_id": "u_0004", "utterance_type": "statement", "text": "Thank you, Philipp. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with the results at the \nAlphabet level and will then cover our segment results. I'll end with some commentary on our outlook for the second half of 2025. We had another solid quarter in \nQ2. Consolidated revenue of $96.4 billion increased by 14% or 13% in constant currency. Search and YouTube advertising, subscription platforms and devices \nand Google Cloud each had double-digit revenue growth this quarter reflecting strong momentum across the business. Total cost of revenue was $39 billion, up \n10%. Tech was $14.7 billion, up 10%; and other cost of revenue was $24.3 billion, up 10%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition costs, largely \nfor YouTube, followed by depreciation. Total operating expenses increased 20% to $26.1 billion. The biggest driver of growth was expense for legal and other \nmatters, which reflected the impact of $1.4 billion charge related to a settlement in principle of certain legal matters. R&D investments increased by 16%, primarily\n\ndriven by increases in compensation and depreciation expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased 5%, primarily reflecting an increase in advertising and\npromotional expenses. Operating income increased 14% this quarter to $31.3 billion and operating margin was 32.4%. Operating margin benefited from strong\nrevenue growth and continued efficiencies in our expense base, partially offset by the legal charge I mentioned earlier, and a significant increase in depreciation\nexpense. Net income increased 19% to $28.2 billion, and earnings per share increased 22% to $2.31. We generated free cash flow of $5.3 billion in the second\nquarter and $66.7 billion for the trailing 12 months. Free cash flow in the second quarter was affected by a sizable sequential increase in CapEx and cash tax\npayments as we make federal tax payments in the second quarter for both Q1 and Q2. We ended the quarter with $95 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nTurning to segment results. Google Services revenues increased 12% to $82.5 billion reflecting strength in Google Search and YouTube advertising and\nsubscriptions. Google Search and other revenues increased by 12% to $54.2 billion. Search and other revenues delivered growth across all verticals with the\nlargest contributions coming from retail and financial services. YouTube advertising revenues increased 13% to $9.8 billion, driven by direct response advertising,\nfollowed by brand. Network advertising revenue of $7.4 billion were down 1%. Subscription platforms and devices revenues increased 20% to $11.2 billion,\nprimarily reflecting growth in subscription revenues. This growth was driven by YouTube subscription offerings followed by Google One, with the growth in paid\nsubscriptions being the biggest driver of revenue growth. Google Services operating income increased 11% to $33.1 billion. Operating margin was flat\nyear-on-year at 40.1% as healthy revenue growth and continued efficiency in our expense base were partially offset by the legal charge I mentioned earlier.\nTurning to the Google Cloud segment, which delivered very strong results this quarter. Revenues increased by 32% to $13.6 billion in the second quarter,\nreflecting growth in GCP across core and AI products at the rate that was much higher than cloud's overall revenue growth and growth in Google Workspace,\ndriven by an increase in average revenue per seat and the number of seats. Google Cloud operating income increased to $2.8 billion, and operating margin\nincreased from 11.3% to 20.7%. The expansion in cloud operating margin was driven by strong revenue performance and continued efficiencies in our expense\nbase partially offset by higher technical infrastructure usage costs, which includes the associated depreciation. As we ramp our AI investments, we continue to\nfocus on driving improvements in productivity and efficiency to offset growth in technical infrastructure-related expenses, particularly from higher depreciation.\nGoogle Cloud backlog increased 18% sequentially in Q2 and 38% year-over-year, reaching $106 billion at the end of the quarter. This growth was driven by\nstrong demand for our products and services from both new and existing customers. As Sundar mentioned, we have signed multiple billion dollar plus deals in the\nfirst half of the year. As to our Other Bets in the second quarter, revenue were $373 million, and operating loss was $1.2 billion. Within Other Bets, we're\nallocating more resources to businesses like Waymo, where we see opportunities to create additional value. With respect to CapEx in the second quarter, our\nCapEx was $22.4 billion. The vast majority of our CapEx was invested in technical infrastructure with approximately 2/3 of investments in servers and 1/3 in data\ncenters and networking equipment. In Q2, we returned capital to shareholders through repurchase of stock of $13.6 billion and dividend payments of $2.5 billion.\nTurning to our outlook. I would like to provide some commentary on several factors that will impact our business performance in the second half of 2025 as well\nas an updated outlook for full year CapEx. First, in terms of revenues, we're pleased with the overall momentum we're seeing across the business. At current spot\nrates, we could see a tailwind to our revenue in Q3. However, volatility in exchange rates could affect the impact of FX on Q3 revenue.

In Cloud, as I mentioned, the demand for our products is high as evidenced by the continued revenue growth and the cloud\nbacklog of $106 billion. While we have been working hard to increase capacity and have improved the pace of server deployment, we expect to remain in a tight\ndemand supply environment going into 2026. Moving to investments. Given the strong demand for our cloud products and services, we now expect to invest\napproximately $85 billion in CapEx in 2025, up from a previous estimate of $75 billion. Our updated outlook reflects additional investment in servers, the timing of\ndelivery of servers and an acceleration in the pace of data center construction, primarily to meet cloud customer demand. Looking out to 2026, we expect a\nfurther increase in CapEx due to the demand we're seeing from customers as well as growth opportunities across the company. We will provide more details on\nthe 2026 CapEx outlook on a future earnings call. In terms of expenses, first, as I mentioned in our previous earnings call, the significant increase in our\ninvestments in CapEx over the past few years will continue to put pressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of higher depreciation. In the second quarter,\ndepreciation increased $1.3 billion year-over-year to $5 billion, reflecting a growth rate of 35%. Given the recent increase in CapEx investments, we expect the\ngrowth rate and depreciation to accelerate further in Q3. Second, as we've previously said, we expect some headcount growth in 2025 in key investment areas. In\nthe third quarter, we expect a sequential increase in total headcount additions due in part to the hiring of new graduates. And third, Q3 will reflect the expense\nassociated with the upcoming August launch of the new Pixel family of products. In conclusion, as you heard from Sundar and Philipp, we're pleased with the\nmomentum in the business and excited about the pace of innovation. Our full stack approach, which combines AI infrastructure, AI research and AI products and\nplatforms position us well to deliver new products and services across the company. We're seeing great momentum with our efforts as demonstrated by the\nincrease in cumulative token processed. Search revenues are seeing healthy growth with features like AI Overviews, AI Mode and Lens, offering new ways for\nusers to access the information. Cloud has reached an annual revenue run rate of more than $50 billion and is delivering margin expansion while continue to\ninvest to meet customer demand. And YouTube has expanded its addressable market by building new services like shorts which now averages over 200 billion\ndaily views. We're excited to see the value our products and services are bringing to customers and partners around the globe.

There's definitely exciting progress, including in the models we haven't fully released yet. And\nthe main gaps we're all trying to do is you're obviously chaining a sequence of events. And so being able to do it reliably the latency compounds, the cost\ncompounds and being able to do it reliably in a way for the users all of this comes together. In each of this, we are making progress, and it all needs to kind of\nhang together. The good news is we are making robust progress. We think we are at the frontier there. And in all of these areas, when you look back on a\n12-month basis, you end up making the models much more efficient for any given capability. So the forward-looking trajectory, I think, will really unlock these\nagentic experiences. We see the potential being able to do them, but they're a bit slow and costly and takes time, and sometimes are brittle, right? But they're\nmaking progress on all of that. And I think that's what will really unlock. And I expect 2026 to be the year in which people kind of use agentic experiences more\nbroadly, right? And so it's an exciting opportunity ahead.

Again, given you've asked a question about agents, we are now beginning to roll out agentic coding journeys for our software\nengineers within the company.
