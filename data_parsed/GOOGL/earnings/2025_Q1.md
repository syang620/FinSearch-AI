## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Brian Nowak (Morgan Stanley)**: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is sort of the macro advertising backdrop. Maybe, Anat, I know it's April '24, and you call out
some factors. You're kind of thinking about the second quarter. Any other factors you're seeing in advertising verticals or regions or categories that could be
showing any signs of weakness quarter dates? We should think through any other changes from typical seasonality in 2Q '25 versus prior quarters? Then the
second one on Philipp, I think I heard you mention now the volume of commercial queries has increased. Maybe can you just walk us through which of the
products are driving that increase in commercial queries. And as you sort of think about the pipeline of Search products are there any others that you're
particularly excited about to kind of continue to drive further commercial query growth throughout '25-'26? Thanks.

### Exchange 002

**Doug Anmuth (JPMorgan)**: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Philipp, maybe just to go back to AI Overviews for a moment. Can you just tell us how we should think about the 1.5 billion
AI Overviews users just in terms of breadth of rollout? And I know you're saying monetization at approximately the same rate. But what does that mean in terms
of click-through rates and conversion? And then, Anat, just curious if there have been any changes to Google's approach to durably reengineering the cost base
since you've joined and if macro weakens and we see more of a slowdown, would you expect to find additional opportunities to cut back more on costs? Thank
you.

### Exchange 003

**Doug Anmuth (JPMorgan)**: Great. Thank you, both.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.

### Exchange 004

**Eric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs)**: Thank you for taking the questions. First, maybe for Sundar. When you look across the consumer AI landscape today, how are you thinking about continuing to
drive differentiation for Gemini as a platform through the lens of usage, utility or putting product innovation at the forefront of driving consumer habits? And then
the second one may be for Anat. If the macro environment were to change and become more downwardly volatile, how should investors think about the
investments that are must make this year almost fixed in nature versus where there might be more flexibility to alter the investment priorities of the company if the
macro environment were to worsen. Thank you so much.

### Exchange 005

**Eric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs)**: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is now open.

### Exchange 006

**Ross Sandler (Barclays)**: Great. Thanks. One for Sundar, one for Philipp. Sundar, it was disclosed this week in the trial that's going on that Gemini has 35 million DAUs. And just curious
that number obviously trails ChatGPT by a pretty wide margin. Could you talk about the strategy to get that DAU figure much higher that you guys are deploying.
And then Philipp, just curious to hear what you're seeing on the brand advertising side at YouTube in 1Q and into early 2Q. Are brands holding up relatively well
like Direct Response or are they starting to react to some of these macro jitters that we're all experiencing? Any thoughts there? Thank you very much.

### Exchange 007

**Mark Shmulik (Bernstein)**: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Sundar, appreciate the color on Gemini deployment across kind of the 15 products with 0.5 billion users or more. It would
be great to hear more about where you're seeing the most usage and deployment of Gen AI internally at Google. Perhaps whether the capabilities are they in a
place today in terms of either supplementing or augmenting the workforce? And then just to build on that earlier AI Mode type questions, appreciate AI Mode has
2x longer queries than traditional Search. But any color you can share perhaps on how AI Mode behavior differs from how consumers are using the Gemini app?
Thank you.

### Exchange 008

**Mark Mahaney (Evercore)**: Okay, thanks. One for Anat and one for Sundar. Anat, getting back to a question I think that Doug was asking earlier on. You just put up record high or multi-year 
record high margins for both Google Services and for Google Cloud. You talked, Philipp, about depreciation expenses accelerating rapidly throughout the year

because of all the investments you've already you'd warn people about. Back in the September quarter, you seemed relatively confident that you had enough
levers to kind of offset kind of rising infrastructure costs. Was that still your, six months later, is that still your view that you've got enough levers that even with the
rising infrastructure costs you can there's enough in there to kind of counterbalance that. And then just briefly on Waymo, it continues to rise aggressively, the
numbers, Sundar. The long-term business model for Waymo. Is there a reason to make a decision on that soon or have you already made the decision on
whether this is a long-term licensing model or you really want to run this as a standalone ride-sharing delivery autonomous vehicle business. Thank you very
much.

### Exchange 009

**Mark Mahaney (Evercore)**: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Gawrelski from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.

### Exchange 010

**Ken Gawrelski (Wells Fargo)**: Thank you. Two if I may please. First on AI-powered Search, you have a number of AI-powered Search interfaces including three most prominently, AI
Overviews, AI Mode, and Gemini. In the future, should we think of these as distinct experiences that will be long-lasting or more experimental now and Google will
eventually focus on one approach going forward? And the second one is more on the financial side. You continue to experience very healthy gross margin
expansion. We see the TAC, sure, but Anat you also talked about the offsetting depreciation expense. Could you talk about beyond those two buckets where
you're seeing the real savings on the COGS line and driving that gross margin expansion? And maybe even how we should be thinking about that going forward?
Thank you.
