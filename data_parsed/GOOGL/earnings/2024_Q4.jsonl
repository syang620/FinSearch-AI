We delivered another strong quarter in Q4, driven by our leadership in AI and our unique full stack. We're making dramatic \nprogress across compute, model capabilities, and in driving efficiencies. We're rapidly shipping product improvements, and seeing terrific momentum with \nconsumer and developer usage. And we're pushing the next frontiers, from AI agents, reasoning and deep research, to state-of-the-art video, quantum computing \nand more. The company is in a great rhythm and cadence, building, testing, and launching products faster than ever before. This is translating into product usage, \nrevenue growth, and results. In Search, AI overviews are now available in more than 100 countries. They continue to drive higher satisfaction in Search usage. \nMeanwhile, circle to search is now available on over 200 million android devices. In Cloud and YouTube, we said at the beginning of 2024 that we expected to \nexit the year at a combined annual revenue run rate of over $100 billion. We met that goal and ended the year at a run rate of $110 billion. We are set up well for \ncontinued growth. So today I'll provide an update on our AI progress and how it's improving our core consumer products. Then I'll touch on Cloud, YouTube, \nPlatforms and Devices, and Waymo. Let's start with AI. Last quarter, I outlined the three areas of our differentiated full stack approach to AI innovation. Our \nleading AI infrastructure, our world-class research, including models and tooling, and our products and platforms that bring these innovations to people at scale. \nFirst, AI Infrastructure. Our sophisticated global network of cloud regions and data centers provides a powerful foundation for us and our customers, directly \ndriving revenue. We have a unique advantage, because we develop every component of our technology stack, including hardware, compilers, models, and \nproducts. This approach allows us to drive efficiencies at every level, from training and serving, to developer productivity. In 2024, we broke ground on 11 new \ncloud regions and data center campuses in places like South Carolina, Indiana, Missouri, and around the world. We also announced plans for seven new subsea \ncable projects, strengthening global connectivity. Our leading infrastructure is also among the world's most efficient. Google data centers deliver nearly 4x more \ncomputing power per unit of electricity compared to just 5 years ago. These efficiencies, coupled with the scalability, cost and performance we offer, are why \norganizations increasingly choose Google cloud's platform. In fact, today, cloud customers consume more than 8x the compute capacity for training and \ninferencing compared to 18 months ago. We'll continue to invest in our cloud business to ensure we can address the increase in customer demand. Second, \nworld class research including models. In December, we unveiled Gemini 2.0, our most capable AI model yet, built for the agentic era. We launched an \nexperimental version of Gemini 2.0 flash, our workhorse model with low latency and enhanced performance. Flash has already rolled out to the Gemini app, and \ntomorrow we are making 2.0 flash generally available for developers and customers, along with other model updates. So stay tuned. Late last year, we also \ndebuted our experimental Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Model. The progress-to-scale thinking has been super fast, and the reviews so far have been extremely \npositive. We are working on even better thinking models and look forward to sharing those with the developer community soon. Gemini 2.0 advances in multi \nmodality and made of tool use enable us to build new agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant. One early example is Deep Research. It \nuses agentic capabilities to explore complex topics on your behalf, and give key findings, along with sources. It launched in Gemini Advanced in December, and \nis rolling out to android users all over the world. We are seeing great product momentum with our consumer Gemini app, which debuted on IOS last November. \nAnd we have opened up trusted tester access to a handful of research prototypes, including Project Mariner, which can understand and reason across \ninformation on a browser screen to complete tasks and Project Astra. We expect to bring features from both to the Gemini app later this year. We're also excited \nby the progress of our video and image generation models. Veo 2, our state-of-the-art video generation model, and Imagen 3, our highest quality text-to-image \nmodel. These generative media models, as well as Gemini, consistently top industry leader boards and score top marks across industry benchmarks. That's why \nmore than 4.4 million developers are using our Gemini models today, double the number from just 6 months ago. And we continue to drive research \nbreakthroughs in quantum computing. At the end of last year, we announced Willow, our new state-of-the-art quantum computing chip that can reduce errors \nexponentially as we scale up using more qubits. Willow is an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications. This \ntechnology holds so much promise, which is why there was real excitement around this breakthrough. Third, our Products and Platforms put AI into the hands of \nbillions of people around the world. We have seven Products and Platforms with over 2 billion users and all are using Gemini. That includes Search, where \nGemini is powering our AI overviews. People use Search more with AI overviews and usage growth increases over time as people learn that they can ask new \ntypes of questions. This behavior is even more pronounced with younger users who really appreciate the speed and efficiency of this new format. We also are \npleased to see how Circle to Search is driving additional Search use and opening up even more types of questions. This feature is also popular among younger \nusers. Those who have tried Circle to Search before now use it to start more than 10% of their searches. As AI continues to expand the universe of queries that \npeople can ask, 2025 is going to be one of the biggest years for Search innovation yet. Now, let me turn to key highlights from the quarter across Cloud, \nYouTube, Platforms and Devices, and Waymo. First, Google Cloud. Our AI-powered cloud offerings enabled us to win customers such as Mercedes-Benz, \nMercado Libre and Servier. In 2024, the number of first-time commitments more than doubled, compared to 2023. We also deepened customer relationships. \nLast year, we closed several strategic deals over $1 billion, and the number of deals over $250 million doubled from the prior year. Our partners are further \naccelerating our growth, with customers purchasing billions of dollars of solutions through our Cloud marketplace. We continue to see strong growth across our \nbroad portfolio of AI-powered Cloud solutions. It begins with our AI Hypercomputer, which delivers leading performance and cost, across both GPUs and TPUs. \nThese advantages help Citadel with modeling markets and training, and enabled Wayfair to modernize its platform, improving performance and scalability by \nnearly 25%. In Q4, we saw strong uptake of Trillium, our sixth-generation TPU, which delivers 4x better training performance and 3x greater inference throughput\n\ncompared to the previous generation. We also continue our strong relationship with NVIDIA. We recently delivered their H200-based platforms to customers and\njust last week, we were the first to announce a customer running on the highly-anticipated Blackwell platform. Our AI developer platform, Vertex AI, saw a 5x\nincrease in customers year-over-year, with brands like Mondelez International and WPP building new applications and benefitting from our 200+ foundation\nmodels. Vertex usage increased 20x during 2024, with particularly strong developer adoption of Gemini Flash, Gemini 2.0, Imagen 3, and most recently, Veo. We\nare also seeing strong growth in our AI-powered databases, data analytics, and cybersecurity platforms. Customers including Radisson Hotels are now using\nGemini to Search and analyze multi-modal data from across multiple Clouds. Our AI-powered Threat Intelligence and Security Operations products help\ncustomers, including Vodafone and AstraZeneca, identify, protect and defend against threats. Our growing portfolio of AI applications is also seeing strong\ncustomer adoption. In Q4, we introduced Google Agentspace, which helps enterprises synthesize data with Google-quality Search, create Gemini-powered\nagents, and automate transactions for employees. In addition, we recently gave all Google Workspace Business and Enterprise customers access to all of our\npowerful Gemini AI capabilities to help boost their productivity. Moving to YouTube. Nielsen data shows YouTube continues to be number one in streaming\nwatchtime in the U.S., with our share of streaming now at a record high. On election day alone, over 45 million viewers across the U.S. watched election-related\ncontent on YouTube. Our early investment in podcasts is paying off. We integrated podcasts into the core YouTube experience, particularly with video. We are\nnow the most frequently used service for consuming podcasts in the U.S., according to a recent Edison report. This success reflects our long-term approach of\ninvesting in emerging trends, from mobile to the living room. We now have over 250,000 creators in the YouTube Shopping affiliate program in the U.S. and\nKorea alone. We expanded YouTube Shopping at the end of last year to three additional countries, allowing even more creators to share their favorite products\nwith fans and grow their businesses. Philipp will talk more about YouTube performance later in the call. Next, Platforms and Devices. Google One's performance\nhas been outstanding, and is one of our fastest growing subscription products in terms of subscribers and revenue growth. Last month, we announced the first\nbeta of Android 16, plus new Android updates, including a deeper Gemini integration coming to the new Samsung Galaxy S25 series. We also recently\nannounced Android XR, the first Android platform built for the Gemini era. Created with Samsung and Qualcomm, Android XR is designed to power an ecosystem\nof next-generation extended reality devices, like headsets and glasses. Finally, a few words on Waymo which made tremendous progress last year, safely serving\nmore than 4 million passenger trips. It is now averaging over 150,000 trips each week, and growing. Looking ahead, Waymo will be expanding its network and\noperations partnerships to open up new markets, including Austin and Atlanta this year and Miami next year. And in the coming weeks, Waymo One vehicles will\narrive in Tokyo for their first international road trip. We're also developing the sixth-generation Waymo Driver, which will significantly lower hardware costs. I want\nto thank our employees around the world for another great quarter. 2025 is going to be exciting and we\u2019re all ready for it. Philipp, I will hand it over to you.", "char_count": 11125, "word_count": 1746, "token_count": 2261, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "GOOGL_TRANSCRIPT_2024_Q4_u_0001", "company": "GOOGL", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2024, "period": "2024-Q4", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/GOOGL/GOOGL_FY2024_Q4.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

I will quickly cover performance for the quarter, then frame the rest of my remarks around the progress we are delivering \nacross Search, Ads, YouTube and Partnerships, highlighting the impact AI is having on our business and our customers. Google Services revenues were $84 \nbillion for the quarter, up 10%, driven primarily by 11% year-on-year growth in advertising revenues. Strong growth in Search and YouTube advertising was \npartially offset by year-over-year decline in network revenues. In terms of vertical performance, the 13% increase in Search and other revenues was led by \nfinancial services followed by retail. The 14% growth in YouTube advertising revenues was driven by strong spend on U.S. election advertising, with combined \nspend from both parties almost doubling from what we saw in the 2020 elections. Now, in Q4, we saw continued strong growth in revenues from Search. We had \nlots of exciting updates in December, and we're rapidly integrating our AI innovation into our consumer experiences. We've already started testing Gemini 2.0 in \nAI overviews and plan to roll it out more broadly later in the year. In Search, we're seeing people increasingly ask entirely new questions using their voice, \ncamera, or in ways that were not possible before, like with Circle to Search. We're making these benefits available to more consumers. Google is already present \nin over half of journeys where a new brand, product, or retailer are discovered. By offering new ways for people to Search, we're expanding commercial \nopportunities for our advertisers. Shoppers can now take a photo of a product and, using lens, quickly find information about the product, reviews, similar \nproducts, and where they can get it for a great price. Lens is used for over 20 billion visual search queries every month, and the majority of these searches are \nincremental. Retail was particularly strong this holiday season, especially on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which each generated over $1 billion in ad revenue. \nInterestingly, despite the U.S. holiday shopping season being the shortest since 2019, retail sales began much earlier, in October, causing the season to extend \nlonger than anticipated. People shop more than a billion times a day across Google. Last quarter, we introduced a reinvented Google shopping experience, rebuilt \nfrom the ground up with AI. This December saw roughly 13% more daily active users on Google shopping in the U.S. compared to the same period in 2023. \nClosing out on Search with travel, and sharing another interesting trend where we saw spend expand to travel Tuesday. This contributed to 20% year-on-year \nrevenue growth for travel advertisers across Cyber Monday and Travel Tuesday. Moving to Ads. We continue investing in AI capabilities across media buying, \ncreative and measurement. As I said before, we believe that AI will revolutionize every part of the marketing value chain, and over the past quarter, we've seen \nhow our customers are increasingly focusing on optimizing their use of AI. As an example, Petco used DemandGen campaigns across targeting, creative \ngeneration, and bidding to find new pet parent audiences across YouTube. They achieved a 275% higher return on ad spend and a 74% higher click through rate \nthan their social benchmarks. On media buying, we made YouTube select creator takeovers generally available in the U.S. and will be expanding to more \nmarkets this year. Creators know their audience the best and creator takeovers help businesses connect with consumers through authentic and relevant content. \nLooking at Creative, we introduced new controls and made reporting easier in PMAX, helping customers better understand and reinvest into their best performing \nassets. Using asset generation in PMAX. Event Ticket Center achieved a 5x increase in production of creative assets, saving time and effort. They also increased \nconvergence by 300% compared to the previous period when they used manual assets. And finally, Measurement. Last week, we made Meridian, our marketing \nmix model, generally available for customers, helping more business reinvest into creative and media buying strategies that they know work. Based on a Nielsen \nmeta-analysis of marketing mix models, on average, Google AI-powered video campaigns on YouTube deliver 17% higher return on advertising spend than \nmanual campaigns. Turning to YouTube. We saw robust revenue growth backed by continued growth and watch time across ad supported and premium \nexperiences. Our focus here remains on building a streaming platform that enables creators to thrive and unlock the full potential of AI. Expanding on our \nstate-of-the-art video generation model, we announced Veo 2, which creates incredibly high quality video in a wide range of subjects and styles. It's been \ninspiring to see how people are experimenting with it. We'll make it available to creators on YouTube in the coming months. We continue to invest in helping \nYouTube creators work with brands. All advertisers globally can now promote YouTube creator videos and ad campaigns across all AI-powered campaign types \nin Google Ads. And creators can tag partners in their brand videos. Sephora used DemandGen's Shorts-Only channel to boost traffic and brand searches for the \nHoliday Gift Guide campaign and leverage creator collaborations to find the best gift. This drove an 82% relative uplift in searches for Sephora Holiday. Shorts \ncontinues its ascent and is closing the gap with long form. In 2024, the monetization rate of Shorts relative to in-stream viewing increased by more than 30 \npercentage points in the U.S., and we expect to make additional progress in 2025. We're making it easier for advertisers to benefit from Shorts on all screens. \nWe're particularly excited by its success on connected TV, which now makes up 15% of shorts viewing in the U.S. Using a combination of ad formats, Louis \nVuitton reached their overall objectives on both long-form and short-form content. Their shorts exceeded luxury goods benchmark for average view duration by \n89% for equivalent video lengths, while their long-form content exceeded the benchmark by over 15%, with strong engagement from Gen Z and Millennials. \nLooking into the living room, we continue to be number one in streaming watch time in the U.S for nearly two years, according to Nielsen, and our share of \nstreaming is at a record high. Viewers globally streamed over 1 billion hours of YouTube content daily on their TVs in 2024. YouTube makes multi-year\n\ninvestments to tap into shifting consumer behavior. The current surge in living room viewership directly reflects years of work to build the right products and\npartnerships. Creators are now prioritizing high-quality viewing experiences that truly shine on TV screens, inspiring even more viewers to tune in. In fact, the\nnumber of creators making majority of revenue from TV is up over 30% year-on-year. We have also invested in podcasts, where popular shows like Club Shay\nShay and Lex Friedman are increasingly a visual format. YouTube creators and viewers are embracing this. In 2024, people watched over 400 million hours of\npodcasts each month on living room devices alone. YouTube is now the most popular service for podcast listening in the U.S., according to Edison. As always, let\nme wrap with the strong momentum we're seeing in partnerships, where the breadth of what Google has to offer is increasingly being recognized. Sundar\nmentioned our deepening partnership with Samsung. Another expanding partnership is with Citi, who is modernizing its technology infrastructure with Google\nCloud to transform employee and customer experiences. Using Google Cloud, it will improve its digital products, streamline employee workflows, and use\nadvanced high-performance computing to enable millions of daily computations. This partnership also fuels Citi's generative AI initiatives across customer\nservice, document summarization, and search to reduce manual processing. With that, allow me a moment to thank Googlers everywhere for their extraordinary\ncommitment and to our customers and partners for their continued trust.

My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state \notherwise. I will start with the results at the Alphabet level and we'll then cover our segment results. I'll end with some commentary and expectations over the first \nquarter and full year 2025. We had another strong quarter in Q4 with robust momentum across the business. Consolidated revenue of $96.5 billion, increased by \n12% in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth, followed by Cloud. Total cost of revenue was $40.6 \nbillion, up 8%. Tech was $14.8 billion, up 6%. We continue to see a revenue mix shift with Google Search growing at double-digit levels, while network revenues, \nwhich have a much higher tech rate, declined. Other cost of revenue was $25.8 billion, up 9%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisitions costs, \nprimarily for YouTube, followed by depreciation, due to increasing investments in our technical infrastructure. Growth in content acquisition and depreciation were \npartially offset by our year-over-year decline in hardware costs due to the shift in timing of our made-by-Google launches to the third quarter 2024 compared to \nthe fourth quarter of 2023. In terms of total expenses, the year-over-year comparisons reflect $1.2 billion in exit charges that we took in the fourth quarter of 2023 \nin connection with actions to optimize our global office space. As previously disclosed, those charges were allocated across the expense lines in other costs of \nrevenue and OpEx based on associated headcount. Total operating expenses decreased 1% to $24.9 billion. R&D investments increased by 8%, primarily driven \nby increase in compensation and depreciation expenses, partially offset by the impact of charges for office [ph] space optimization in the fourth quarter of 2023. \nSales and marketing expenses decreased 5%, primarily reflecting the optimization charges last year, as well as declines in compensation and in ads and \npromotion expenses due to the timing shift of the Pixel launch from Q4 to Q3. G&A expenses declined by 15%, reflecting a shift of timing in our charitable \ncontributions, as well as the optimization charges last year. Operating income increased 31%, the score [ph] to $31 billion, and operating margin increased to \n32%, representing 4.6 points of margin expansion. Net income increased 28% to $26.5 billion, and earnings per share increased 31% to $2.15. We delivered free \ncash flow of $24.8 billion in the fourth quarter and $72.8 billion for the full year 2024. We ended the quarter with $96 billion in cash and marketable securities. \nTurning to segment results. Google Service revenues increased 10% to $84.1 billion, reflecting the strong momentum across Google Search and YouTube ads. \nGoogle Search and other advertising revenues increased by 13% to $54 billion. The robust performance of Search was once again broad-based across verticals, \nled by the financial service vertical due to strength in insurance, followed by retail. YouTube advertising revenue increased 14% to $10.5 billion, driven by brand, \nfollowed by direct response advertising. Network advertising revenue of $8 billion, were down 4%. In the fourth quarter, the year-over-year comparison in all of \nour advertising revenue lines was impacted by the increase in strength in advertising revenue in Q4 2023, in part from APAC-based retailers. Subscription \nplatforms and device revenues increase 8% to $11.6 billion, primarily reflecting growth in subscription revenues, partially offset by the shift in timing of the launch \nof our made by Google devices to the third quarter, compared with the fourth quarter in 2023. We continue to have significant growth in our subscription products, \nprimarily due to increase in the number of paid subscribers across YouTube TV, YouTube Music Premium, and Google One. With regards to Platform, we saw a \nslight increase in the growth rate in Play, primarily due to a strong increase in the number of buyers. Google's service operating income increased 23% to $32.8 \nbillion, and operating margin increased from 35% to 39%, representing a meaningful margin expansion. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, which continued to \ndeliver very strong results this quarter. Revenue increased by 30% to $12 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in GCP across core GCP products, AI \ninfrastructure, and generative AI solutions. Once again, GCP grew at a rate that was much higher than cloud overall. Healthy Google Workspace growth was \nprimarily driven by increase in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud operating income increased to $2.1 billion, and operating margin increased from 9.4% to \n17.5%. We're pleased with the work the cloud team is doing to deliver valuable solutions to the customer and generate revenue growth, as well as its continued \nfocus on driving efficiencies across the cloud business. As for Other Bets, for the fourth quarter, revenue were $400 million, and the operating loss was $1.2 \nbillion. The year-over-year decline in revenue and increase in operating loss primarily reflect the milestone payment in the fourth quarter of 2023 for one of the \nOther Bets. Turning to Alphabet level activities, the largest component of this line is our investments in AI research and development activities which support all of \nAlphabet. As a reminder, Alphabet level activities have included nearly all severance charges from reductions in workforce and office space charges. In the fourth \nquarter of 2024, the biggest factor in year-over-year comparison is the $1.2 billion in charges in the fourth quarter of 2023, almost entirely in connection with office \nspace optimization. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the fourth quarter was $14 billion, primarily reflecting investments in our technical \ninfrastructure, with the largest component being investment in servers, followed by data centers, to support the growth of our business across Google Services,", "char_count": 6254, "word_count": 975, "token_count": 1315, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "GOOGL_TRANSCRIPT_2024_Q4_u_0003", "company": "GOOGL", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2024, "period": "2024-Q4", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/GOOGL/GOOGL_FY2024_Q4.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

Overall, we returned a total of nearly $70 billion to shareholders in 2024. Turning to 2025, I would like to provide some commentary on several factors \nthat will impact our business performance in both the first quarter and the full year 2025. First in terms of revenue, I'll highlight two items that will have meaningful \nimpact on Q1 revenue across the company. First in terms of revenues, I'll highlight two items that will have meaningful impact on Q1 revenues across the \ncompany. The first is the impact of foreign exchange rates. At the current spot rates, we expect a larger headwind to our revenues from the strengthening of the \nU.S dollar relative to key currencies in Q1 versus Q4 2024. Second is the impact of leap year. We expect a headwind from having one less day of revenue in Q1 \n2025 compared with leap year in the first quarter of 2024. As for our segments, Google Services, advertising revenue in 2025 will be impacted by lapping the \nstrength we experience in the financial service vertical throughout 2024. And in Cloud, given the revenues are correlated with the timing of deployment of new \ncapacity, we could see variability in cloud revenue growth rates depending on when new capacity comes online during 2025. Moving to investments, starting with \nour expectation for CapEx for the full year 2025. As we mentioned on the Q3 call, as we expand our AI efforts, we expect to increase our investments in capital \nexpenditure for technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking. We expect to invest approximately $75 billion in CapEx in \n2025 with approximately $16 billion to $18 billion of debt in the first quarter. The expected total investment level may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, primarily \ndue to timing of deliveries and construction schedules. In terms of expenses, first, the increase in our investment in CapEx over the past few years will increase \npressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of higher depreciation. In 2024, we saw 28% year-over-year growth in depreciation as we put more technical \ninfrastructure assets into service. Given the increase in CapEx investments over the past few years, we expect the growth rate and depreciation to accelerate in \n2025. Second, we expect some headcount growth in 2025 in key investment areas such as AI and cloud. As you just heard from Sundar, we're delivering\n\nproducts and solutions to customer at a rapid pace, building, testing, and launching products faster than ever before. And as I mentioned on the Q3 call, we're\ndoing that while also focusing on driving further efficiencies in how we operate the business. Before we take questions, I'd like to recap the financial results for the\nyear. For the full year 2024, revenue grew by 14% or by $43 billion, reaching $350 billion. Google Services and Google Cloud each continue to see double-digit\nrevenue growth coupled with margin extension. YouTube and cloud revenues combined, ended the year at $110 billion annual run rate. And in 2024, we generate\ntotal income of $112 billion, an increase of 33% from 2023. We're pleased with the momentum we're seeing in AI innovation and monetization. We've been using\nAI to improve the performance of our ads business for well over a decade, and Cloud is generating billions in annual revenue from AI infrastructure and\ngenerative AI solutions. We're also excited about the potential to bring new experiences to users that will provide additional opportunities for monetization. And I\nlook forward to sharing more in our progress throughout the year.

I'll remain focused on areas that I've mentioned before, which\ninclude the technical infrastructure, so the $75 billion in CapEx I mentioned for this year, the majority of that is going to go towards our technical infrastructure,\nwhich includes servers and data centers.

Look, I think there's been a lot of observations on DeepSeek. First of all, I think a tremendous team. I think they've done very, very good work. Look,\nI think for us it's always been obvious, over time, there's frontier model development, but you can drive a lot of efficiency to serve these models really, really well.\nAnd if you look at one of the areas in which the Gemini model shine is the Pareto frontier of cost, performance, and latency and if you look at all three attributes, I\nthink we lead this Pareto frontier. And I would say both are 2.0 flash models or 2.0 flash thinking models. They are some of the most efficient models out there,\nincluding comparing to DeepSeek's V3 and R1. And I think a lot of it is our strength of the full stack development into an optimization, our obsession with cost per\nquery, all of that, I think, sets us up well for the workloads ahead, both to serve billions of users across our products and on the cloud side. Couple of things I\nwould say are, if you look at the trajectory over the past 3 years, the proportion of the spend towards inference compared to training has been increasing, which is\ngood because obviously inference is to support businesses with good ROIC.
