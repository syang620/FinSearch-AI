And hello, everyone. I'm really pleased with our results this quarter. They showed tremendous ongoing momentum in Search and great progress \nin Cloud with our AI initiatives driving new growth. Search had another excellent quarter. And in terms of product innovation, we are seeing great progress with AI \noverviews. In Q2, Cloud reached some major milestones. Quarterly revenues crossed the $10 billion mark for the first time, at the same time pass the $1 billion \nmark in quarterly operating profit. Year-to-date, our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for Cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues \nand are being used by more than 2 million developers. As I spoke about last quarter, we are uniquely well-positioned for the AI opportunity ahead. Our Research \nand Infrastructure leadership means, we can pursue an in-house strategy that enables our product teams to move quickly. Combined with our model building \nexpertise, we are in a strong position to control our destiny, as the technology continues to evolve. Importantly, we are innovating at every layer of the AI stack, \nfrom chips to agents and beyond, a huge strength. We are committed to this leadership long-term.

Let's dive in. Over the past 25 years, we have continued to reimagine and expand Google Search \nacross many technological shifts. With AI, we are delivering better responses on more types of search queries and introducing new ways to search. We are \npleased to see the positive trends from our testing continue as we roll out AI overviews, including increases in search usage, and increased user satisfaction with \nthe results. People who are looking for help with complex topics are engaging more and keep coming back for AI overviews. And we see even higher \nengagement from younger users, aged 18 to 24, when they use search with AI overviews. As we have said, we are continuing to prioritize approaches that send \ntraffic to sites across the web. And we are seeing that ads appearing either above or below AI overviews, continue to provide valuable options for people to take \naction and connect with businesses. Beyond AI overviews, AI expands the types of queries we are able to address and opens up powerful new ways to search. \nVisual search via Lens is one. Soon you'll be able to ask questions by taking a video with Lens. And already we have seen that AI overviews in Lens, leads to an \nincrease in overall visual search usage. Another example is Circle to Search, which is available today on more than 100 million Android devices. We are seeing \ntremendous momentum from our AI investments. More than 1.5 million developers are now using Gemini across our developer tools. And we recently unveiled \nnew models that are more capable and efficient than ever. Gemini now comes in 4 sizes, with each model designed for its own set of use cases. It's a versatile \nmodel family that runs efficiently on everything from data centers to devices. At 2 million tokens, we offer the longest context window of any large-scale foundation \nmodel to-date, which powers developer use cases that no other model can handle. Gemini is making Google's own products better. All six of our products with \nmore than 2 billion monthly users now use Gemini. This means that Google is the company that's truly bringing AI to everyone. Gemini is powering incredibly \nhelpful features in search, workspace, Google messages, and more. At I/O, we showed new features coming soon to Gmail and to Google Photos. Soon you'll be \nable to ask photos questions like, what did I eat at that restaurant in Paris last year? For a glimpse of the future, I hope you saw Project Astra at I/O. It shows \nmultimodal understanding and natural conversational capabilities. We've always wanted to build a universal agent and it's an early look at how they can be helpful \nin daily life. Our AI product advances come from our long-standing foundation of research leadership, as well as our global network of infrastructure. In Q2, we \nannounced our first data center and cloud region in Malaysia, and expansion projects in Iowa, Virginia, and Ohio. Our TPUs are a key bet here, too. Trillium is the \nsixth generation of our custom AI accelerator, and it's our best performing and most energy efficient TPU to-date. It achieves a near 5 times increase in peak \ncompute performance per chip and a 67% more energy efficient compared to TPU v5e. And the latest Nvidia Blackwell platform, will be coming to Google Cloud \nin early 2025. We continue to invest in designing and building robust and efficient infrastructure to support our efforts in AI, given the many opportunities we see \nahead. Of course, as we do this, we'll continue to create capacity by allocating resources towards our highest priorities. We are relentlessly driving efficiencies in \nour AI models. For example, over the past quarter, we have made quality improvements that include doubling the core model size for AI overviews, while at the \nsame time improving latency and keeping cost per AI overviews served flat. And we are focused on matching the right model size to the complexity of the query in \norder to minimize impact on cost and latency. Separately on our real estate investments, we are taking a measured approach to match the current and future \nneeds of our hybrid workforce, as well as our local communities. Next, Google Cloud. We continue to see strong customer interest, winning leading brands like \nHitachi, Motorola Mobility, and KPMG. Our deep partnership with Oracle significantly expanded our joint offerings to the large customer base. Our momentum \nbegins with our AI infrastructure, which provides AI startups like Essential AI, with leading cost performance for models and high-performance computing \napplications. We continue to drive fundamental differentiation with new advances since Cloud Next. This includes Trillium, which I mentioned earlier, and A3 \nMega powered by Nvidia H100 GPUs, which doubles the networking bandwidth of A3. Our enterprise AI platform, Vertex, helps customers such as Deutsche \nBank, Kingfisher, and the US Air Force build powerful AI agents. Last month, we announced a number of new advances. Uber and WPP are using Gemini Pro 1.5 \nand Gemini Flash 1.5 in areas like customer experience and marketing. We broaden support for third-party models, including Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and \nopen source models like Gemma 2, Llama and Mistral. We are the only cloud provider to offer grounding with Google Search, and we are expanding grounding \ncapabilities with Moody's, MSCI, ZoomInfo, and more. Our AI-powered applications portfolio is helping us win new customers and drive upsell. For example, our \nconversational AI platform is helping customers like Best Buy and Gordon Food Service. Gemini for Workspace helps click therapeutics analyze patient feedback \nas they build targeted digital treatments. Our AI-powered agents are also helping customers develop better quality software, find insights from their data, and \nprotect their organization against cybersecurity threats using Gemini. Software engineers at Wipro are using Gemini code assist to develop, test, and document\n\nsoftware faster. And data analysts at Mercado Libre are using BigQuery and Looker to optimize capacity planning and fulfill shipments faster. Cyber security risks\ncontinue to accelerate and the number of breaches continue to grow, something we all see in the news every day and that our [Mandiant teams] (ph) help\nmanage. Our strong track record of uptime, quality control and reliability made Google Cloud the trusted security choice for organizations like Fiserv and Marriott\nInternational. In Q2, we infused AI throughout our security portfolio, helping TELUS strengthen its proactive security posture. Turning next to YouTube, YouTube\nis focused on a clear strategy, connecting creators with a massive audience and enabling them to build successful businesses through ads and subscriptions,\nwhile helping advertisers reach their desired audience. We had a great brand cast this quarter, and Philip will say more. I'm pleased at the progress here.\nYouTube has remained number one in US Streaming watch time, according to Nielsen. Views of YouTube shots on connected TVs more than double last year.\nAnd we are making it easier for creators to add captions and turn regular videos into shots. Next, on Android and Pixel. We joined Samsung for their Galaxy\nUnpacked event a few weeks ago, and we shared that Samsung's new devices will include the latest AI-powered Google updates on Android. It was a great\nevent. I'm looking forward to our Made by Google event happening in August. We'll have lots to share around Android and the Pixel portfolio of devices. Our Pixel\nline is doing well. We recently introduced the new Pixel 8a, powered by our latest Google Tensor G3 chip. It provides beautiful AI experiences like Circle to\nSearch, Best Take, and a Gemini-powered AI assistant. In other bets, I'm really pleased with the progress Waymo's making, a real leader in the space and getting\nrave reviews from users. Waymo's served more than 2 million trips to-date and driven more than 20 million fully autonomous miles on public roads. Waymo's now\ndelivering well over 50, 000 weekly paid public rides, primarily in San Francisco and Phoenix. And in June, we removed the waitlist in San Francisco, so anyone\ncan take a ride. Fully autonomous testing is underway in other Bay Area locations without a human in the driver's seat. Before I close, I want to acknowledge that\ntoday is Ruth's final earnings call. Let me take a moment to thank her for all she has done for Google and Alphabet as our longest-serving CFO. I'm excited to\ncontinue to work with her in her new role. And I look forward to welcoming our newly appointed CFO, Anat Ashkenazi. She starts next week, and you'll hear from\nher on our call next quarter. Thanks as always to our employees and partners everywhere for a great Q2.

Starting with performance, Google Services delivered revenues of $73.9 billion for the quarter, up 12% year-on-year.\nSearch and other revenues grew 14% year-on-year, led by growth in the retail vertical, followed by financial services. YouTube ads revenues were up 13%\nyear-on-year driven by growth and brand as well as direct response. Network revenues declined 5% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms, and devices,\nyear-on-year revenues increased 14%, driven again by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions. For the rest of my remarks, I want to double click on two topics.\nFirst, how we're applying AI across the marketing process to deliver an even stronger ads experience. Second, YouTube's position as the leading multi-format\nplatform. So let me start by sharing some of the ways we are applying AI to bring more performance benefits to even more businesses. Q2 brought several major\nopportunities to meet and learn from users, developers, creators, and customers. From I/O to Brandcast, Google Marketing Live and Can, a growing number of\nour customers and partners are looking to understand how to successfully incorporate AI into their businesses. This quarter, we announced over 30 new ads\nfeatures, and products to help advertisers leverage AI and keep pace with the evolving expectations of customers and users. Across Search, PMax, DemandGen,\nand Retail, we're applying AI to streamline workflows, enhance creative asset production, and provide more engaging experiences for consumers. Listening to our\ncustomers, retailers in particular have welcomed AI-powered features to help scale the depth and breadth of their assets. For example, as part of a new and\neasier-to-use merchant center, we've expanded Product Studio, with tools that bring the power of Google AI to every business owner. You can upload a product\nimage from the AI with something like, feature this product with Paris skyline in the background and Product Studio will generate campaign ready assets. I also\nhear great feedback from our customers on many of our other new AI-powered features. We're beta testing, virtual try on and shopping ads and plan to roll it out\nwidely later this year. Feedback shows this feature gets 60% more high-quality views than other images and a higher click-out to retailer sites. Retailers love it\nbecause it drives purchasing decisions and fewer returns. Our AI-driven profit optimization tools have been expanded to performance max and standard shopping\ncampaigns. Advertisers use profit optimization and smart bidding see a 15% uplift in profit on average compared to revenue-only bidding. Lastly, DemandGen is\nrolling out to Display in Video 360 and Search Ads 360 in the coming months with new generative image tools that create stunning high-quality image assets for\nsocial marketers. As we said at GML, when paired with Search or PMax, DemandGen delivers an average of 14% more conversions. The use cases we're seeing\nacross the industry show the incredible potential of these AI-enabled products to improve performance. Let me briefly share two examples with you. Luxury\njewelry retailer Tiffany leveraged DemandGen during the holiday season and saw 2.5% brand lift in consideration and actions, such as adding items to cards and\nbooking appointments. The campaign drove a 5.6 times more efficient cost per click compared to social media benchmarks. Our own Google marketing team\nused DemandGen to create nearly 4,500 ad variations for a Pixel 8 campaign shown across YouTube, Discover, and Gmail, delivering twice the click-through rate\nat nearly a quarter of the cost. In addition to strengthening our ads products for customers, we continue to evolve our existing systems and products with\nimproved models delivering further performance gains. In just six months, AI-driven improvements to quality, relevance, and language understanding have\nimproved Broad Match performance by 10% for advertisers using Smart Bidding. Also, advertisers who adopt PMax to Broad Match and Smart Bidding in their\nSearch campaigns, see an average increase of over 25% more conversions or value at a similar cost. We'll continue to listen to our customers and use their\nfeedback to drive innovation across our products. As you can hear, I continue to be excited about the AI era for ads. Now let's turn to YouTube. I've talked before\nabout our approach to making YouTube the best place to create, watch and monetize. First, the best place to create. What sets YouTube apart from every other\nplatform are the creators and the connection they have with their fans. Audiences tuning in to watch their favorite creators continue to grow. For example, two\nweeks ago, Mr. Beast's channel hit more than 300 million subscribers. Next, the best place to watch. Our long-term investment in CTV continues to deliver. Views\non CTV have increased more than 130% in the last three years. According to Nielsen, YouTube is the Number #1 most watched streaming platform on TV\nscreens in the US for the 17th consecutive month. Zooming out, when you look not just at streaming, but at all media companies and their combined TV\nviewership, YouTube is the second most watched after Disney. And this growth is happening in multiple verticals, including sports, which has seen CTV watch\ntime on YouTube grow 30% year-over-year. Lastly, the best place to monetize. CTV on YouTube is continuing to benefit from a combination of strong watch time\ngrowth, viewer and advertiser innovation and a shift in brand advertising budgets from linear TV to YouTube. Our largest advertisers across verticals, including\nretail, entertainment, telco and home and personal care, are partnering with creators on ads and organic integrations. Verizon, for example, worked with a\nYouTube creator and Verizon customer to show them many ways that plans and offerings can be customized to fit people\u2019s lives. Using AI-powered formats, they\ncreated sketches in multiple lengths and orientations to serve the right creative to the right viewer and drive people to their site. Verizon's creator ads had a 15%\nlower CPA and a 38% higher conversion rate versus other ads. Turning to Shorts. Last quarter, I shared that in the US, the monetization rate of YouTube Shorts\nrelative to in-stream viewing is showing a healthy rate of growth. Again, this quarter, we continue to see an improvement in Shorts monetization, particularly in the\nUS. We are also seeing a very encouraging contribution from brand advertising on Shorts, which we launched on the product in Q4 last year. Lastly, a few words\non shopping. Last year, viewers watched 30 billion hours of shopping-related videos, and we saw a 25% increase in watch time for videos that help people shop.\nWhile it is early days, shopping remains a key area of investment. At GML, we rolled out several product updates to YouTube shopping, helping creators sell\nproducts to their viewers. These updates included; product tagging where creators can tag products in their videos for viewers to discover and purchase, product\ncollections and a new affiliate hub, a one-stop shop for creators to find deals and promotional offers from brands and track their affiliate earnings. With that, I'll\nfinish by saying a huge thank you to Google's everywhere for their extraordinary commitment and to our customers and partners for their continued collaboration\nand trust. And Ruth, thanks for your amazing leadership and partnership over all these years. Now for one last time, it's over to you.", "char_count": 7528, "word_count": 1202, "token_count": 1538, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "GOOGL_TRANSCRIPT_2024_Q2_u_0003", "company": "GOOGL", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2024, "period": "2024-Q2", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/GOOGL/GOOGL_FY2024_Q2.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

We had another strong quarter, driven in particular by performance in Search and Cloud, as well as\nthe ongoing efforts to durably reengineer our cost base. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I state otherwise. I will\nstart with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $84.7\nbillion, up 14% or up 15% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was\n$35.5 billion, up 11%. Other cost of revenues was $22.1 billion, up 14%, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs, followed by depreciation\nas well as the impact of the Canadian digital services tax, which was applied retroactively. Operating expenses were $21.8 billion up 5%, primarily reflecting an\nincrease in R&D partially offset by a decline in G&A with sales and marketing essentially flat to the second quarter last year. The increase in R&D was driven\nprimarily by compensation which was affected by lapping a reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities in certain other bets in the second quarter last\nyear followed by depreciation. The largest single factor in the year-on-year decline in G&A expenses was lower charges related to legal matters. Operating\nincome was $27.4 billion, up 26% and our operating margin was 32%. Net income was $23.6 billion and EPS was $1.89. We delivered free cash flow of $13.5\nbillion in the second quarter and $60.8 billion for the trailing 12 months. As a reminder, last year, we had a timing benefit in the second and third quarters from a\n$10.5 billion deferred cash tax payment made in the fourth quarter, which depressed reported free cash flow growth this quarter, and we'll do so again next\nquarter. We ended the quarter with $101 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $73.9\nbillion, up 12%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $48.5 billion in the quarter were up 14%, led again by growth in retail, followed by the financial\nservices vertical. YouTube advertising revenues of $8.7 billion were up 13% driven by brand followed by direct response advertising. Network advertising\nrevenues of $7.4 billion were down 5%. Subscription platforms and devices revenues were $9.3 billion up 14%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube\nsubscription revenues. TAC was $13.4 billion, up 7%. Google Services operating income was $29.7 billion up 27% and the operating margin was 40%. Turning to\nthe Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $10.3 billion for the quarter, up 29%, reflecting first significant growth in GCP, which was above growth for cloud\noverall and includes an increasing contribution from AI. And second, strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat.\nGoogle Cloud delivered operating income of $1.2 billion and an operating margin of 11%. As to our Other Bets for the second quarter, revenues were $365 million\nand the operating loss was $1.1 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, First, within advertising. The strong performance\nof search was broad-based across verticals. In YouTube, we are pleased with the growth in the quarter. We had healthy watch time growth continued to close the\nmonetization gap in Shorts and had continued momentum in Connected TV, with brand benefiting in part from an ongoing shift in budgets from linear television to\ndigital. As we look forward to the third quarter, we will be lapping the increasing strength in advertising revenues in the second half of 2023, in part from APAC\nbased retailers. Turning to subscriptions, platforms and devices. First, we continue to have significant growth in our subscriptions business which drives the\nmajority of revenue growth in this line. However, there was a sequential decline in the year-on-year growth rate, as we anniversaried the impact of a price\nincrease for YouTubeTV in the second quarter last year. The impact will persist through the balance of the year. Second, with regard to platforms. We are\npleased with the performance in play driven by an increase in buyers. Finally, with respect to devices. The most important point as we look forward is that our\nMade by Google launches have been pulled forward into the third quarter from the fourth quarter last year benefiting revenues in Q3 this year. Turning to cloud,\nwhich continued to deliver very strong results. For the first time, Cloud crossed $10 billion in quarterly revenues and $1 billion in quarterly operating profit. As\nSundar noted year-to-date, our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used\nby more than 2 million developers. We're particularly encouraged that the majority of our top 100 customers are already using our generative AI solutions. We\ncontinue to invest aggressively in the business. Turning to margins. The margin expansion in Q2 versus last year reflects our ongoing efforts to durably\nreengineer our cost base, as well as revenue strength. Our leadership team remains focused on our efforts to moderate the pace of expense growth in order to\ncreate capacity for the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. Once again\nheadcount declined quarter-on-quarter, which reflects both actions we have taken in the first half of the year and a much slower pace of hiring. Looking ahead, we\nexpect a slight increase in headcount in the third quarter, as we bring on new graduates. As we have discussed previously, we\u2019re continuing to invest in top\nengineering and technical talent, particularly in cloud and technical infrastructure. Looking forward, we continue to expect to deliver full-year 2024 Alphabet\noperating margin expansion relative to 2023. However, in the third quarter operating margins will reflect the impact of both the increases in depreciation and\nexpenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure, as well as the increase in cost of revenues due to the pull-forward of\nhardware launches into Q3. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the second quarter was $13 billion, once again driven overwhelmingly by investment in\nour technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers. Looking ahead, we continue to expect quarterly CapEx throughout\nthe year to be roughly at or above the Q1 CapEx of $12 billion keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx.\nWith regard to other bets, we continue to focus on improving overall efficiencies, as we invest for long-term returns. Waymo is an important example of this, with\nits technical leadership coupled with progress on operational performance. As you will see in the 10-Q, we have chosen to commit to a new multi-year investment\nof $5 billion. This new round of funding, which is consistent with recent annual investment levels will enable Waymo to continue to build the world's leading\nautonomous driving technology company. To close, this is my 56th and last earnings call, 37 of them at Alphabet. So I have a few closing thoughts of gratitude.\nI've been so proud to be at Google and Alphabet as CFO and to work with some of the smartest people in the world every day. I think, we have accomplished a\nlot in the last nine plus years, and I am confident that progress will continue. Of course, I'm not going far and I'm honored to have my new role, which I've been\nslowly working my way into during the past 11 months and I look forward to continuing to work with Sundar, and our great team. Being CFO of one of the most\nimportant companies in the world has been the opportunity and responsibility of a lifetime. Google's Mission of advancing technology and bringing information to\npeople throughout the world is as relevant today as it was when I worked on its IPO. Technology has been a catalyst for economic growth throughout human\nhistory. The people on this call know that if a technological advancement is not the focus of every business and government, they will be left behind. Underpinning\nthis is the need for sound and responsible investment. That has never been more important than today and certainly, that is Google and Alphabet's focus. I want\nto end by thanking Googlers around the world for the innovation and commitment that has enabled us to deliver such extraordinary products and services\nglobally. I also want to thank our investors and analysts for your long-term support and your feedback. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your\nquestions.\nOperator\nThank you.

Look, the reason we've consistently used the term, the phrase that we're focused on durably\nreengineering our cost base is because these are deep work streams. They are not tactical fixes, and we continue to build on them. And so the main areas that\nwe've talked about are around product and process prioritization around organizational efficiency and structure. Both of those are reflected in the headcount and\nthe fact that headcount is down year-on-year. And across all of those -- as I said, across our entire leadership team, we remain focused on continuing to execute\nagainst them. So in terms of the most recent examples, as we talked about last quarter with the combination of the devices and services product area with the\nplatforms and ecosystems product area, we announced that back in April. And what we discussed last quarter and what we're seeing is that unifying teams\nacross these organizations, helps with product execution and what we're really focused on is really adding to velocity and efficiency. So kind of the gift that keeps\ngiving. And then more broadly, all of the work streams that we've talked to you about before, we continue to remain focused on. A big one, very important one, is\nall of the efficiency efforts, the work streams around technical infrastructure and improving efficiency there. We are also working on the use of AI across Alphabet.\nWe are working on continuing to build on what we've done with our centralized procurement organization.

Look, on the Cloud and AI stuff, obviously, it is something which I think will end up being a big driver over time.

People are deeply engaging with Gemini \nmodels across Vertex and AI studio. We now have over 2 million developers playing around with these things, and you are definitely seeing early use cases.

I think great questions. Look, I -- obviously, we are at an early stage of what I view as a very transformative area and in technology when you are\ngoing through these transitions, aggressively investing upfront in a defining category, particularly in an area in which in a leveraged way cuts across all our core\nareas our products, including Search, YouTube and other services, as well as fuels growth in Cloud and supports the innovative long-term Bets and Other Bets is\ndefinitely something for us makes sense to lean in. I think the one way I think about it is when we go through a curve like this, the risk of under-investing is\ndramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here, even in scenarios where if it turns out that we are over investing. We clearly -- these are\ninfrastructure, which are widely useful for us. They have long useful lives and we can apply it across, and we can work through that. But I think not investing to be\nat the frontier, I think definitely has much more significant downside. Having said that, we obsess around every dollar we put in. Our teams are -- work super hard,\nI'm proud of the efficiency work, be it optimization of hardware, software, model deployment across our fleet. All of that is something we spend a lot of time on,\nand that's how we think about it. To your second question on whether -- how do the scaling loss hold. Are we hitting on some kind of wall or something? Look, I\nthink we are all pushing very hard, and there is going to be a few efforts, which will scale up on the compute side and push the boundaries of these models. What\nI would tell is regardless of how that plays out, you still think there is enough optimizations we are all doing, which is driving constant progress in terms of the\ncapabilities of the models. And more importantly, taking them and translating into real use cases across the consumer and enterprise side, I think on that frontier.\nI think there is still a lot of progress to be had.
