Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. This was a terrific quarter for Alphabet, driven by double-digit growth across every major \npart of our business. We are seeing AI now driving real business results across the company. We delivered our first ever $100 billion quarter. 5 years ago, our \nquarterly revenue was at $50 billion. Our revenue number has doubled since then, and we are firmly in the generative AI era. In parallel, we've built for the long \nterm and diversified with successful businesses in cloud, YouTube and subscriptions. Our momentum is strong, and we are shipping at speed. As just a few \nexamples: our first-party models, like Gemini, now process 7 billion tokens per minute via direct API used by our customers. The Gemini app now has over 650 \nmillion monthly active users, and queries increased by 3x from Q2. Cloud had another great quarter of accelerating growth with AI revenue as a key driver. Cloud \nbacklog grew 46% quarter-over-quarter to $155 billion. And we crossed $300 million paid subscriptions led by growth in Google One and YouTube Premium. \nToday, I'll discuss progress in our full stack approach to AI and then share highlights from search, cloud, YouTube and Waymo. As a reminder, our full stack \napproach spans AI infrastructure, world-class research including models and tooling, and our products and platforms that bring AI to people everywhere. First up, \nAI infrastructure. Our extensive and reliable infrastructure, which powers all of Google's products is the foundation of our stack and a key differentiator. We are \nscaling the most advanced chips in our data centers, including GPUs from our partner, NVIDIA, as well as our own purposeful TPUs. And we are the only \ncompany providing a wide range of both. As we announced yesterday at NVIDIA GTC, we are now shipping the new A4X Max instances powered by NVIDIA \nGB300 to our cloud customers. Our highly sought-after TPU portfolio is led by our 7-generation TPU, Ironwood, which will be generally available soon. We are \ninvesting in TPU capacity to meet the tremendous demand we are seeing from customers and partners, and we are excited that Anthropic recently shared plans \nto access up to 1 million TPUs. Next world-class AI research, including models and tooling. Our models are world-leading. GEMINI 2.5 Pro, Veo, Genie 3 under \nviral sensation Nano Banana are among the very best in class. Over 230 million videos have been generated with Veo 3, and more than 13 million developers \nhave built with our generative models. We are looking forward to the release of Gemini 3 later this year. Our research leadership is advancing next frontier \ntechnologies. Last week, we announced that our Willow quantum chip achieved a major breakthrough, running an algorithm 13,000x faster than 1 of the world's \nbest supercomputers, and the result is verifiable, paving the way to future practical applications. Speaking of quantum, let me congratulate Michel Devoret, our \nChief Scientist for Quantum Hardware. He received a Nobel in physics for early research he did in the 1980s. Three Nobels awarded to current Googlers in 2 \nyears, incredible. And third, our products and platforms. We are bringing AI to more people and developers than anyone else. In July, we announced that we \nprocessed 980 trillion monthly tokens across all our surfaces. We are now processing over 1.3 quarterly and monthly tokens, more than 20x growth in a year, \nphenomenal. This quarter, we took big steps to reimagine Chrome as a browser powered by AI through deep integrations with Gemini and AI Mode in search with \nmore agentic capabilities coming soon. In August at Made by Google, we unveiled our Pixel 10 series of devices. They are the first with our most powerful chip \ndesigned to run on Gemini Tensor G5. They're our best reviewed devices ever. And last week, we launched Android XR, our new operating system at Samsung's \nGalaxy XR device. It brings new ways to use headsets and glasses with Gemini at the core. Now turning to highlights from Search. AI is driving an expansionary \nmoment for Search. As people learn what they can do with our new AI experiences, they're increasingly coming back to Search more. Search and its AI \nexperiences are built to highlight the web, sending billions of clicks to sites every day. During the Q2 call, we shared that overall queries and commercial queries \ncontinue to grow year-over-year. This growth rate increased in Q3, largely driven by our AI investments in Search, most notably AI Overviews and AI Mode. Let \nme dive into the momentum we are seeing. As we have shared before, AI Overviews drive meaningful query growth. This effect was even stronger in Q3 as users \ncontinue to learn that Google can answer more of their questions, and it's particularly encouraging to see the effect was more pronounced with younger people. \nWe're also seeing that AI Mode is resonating well with users. In the U.S., we have seen strong and consistent week-over-week growth in usage since launch and \nqueries doubled over the quarter. Over the last quarter, we rolled out AI Mode globally across 40 languages in record time. It now has over 75 million daily active \nusers, and we shipped over 100 improvements to the product in Q3, an incredibly fast pace. Most importantly, AI Mode is already driving incremental total query \ngrowth for Search. Philipp will talk more about monetization and share how AI is helping people connect with businesses and shop on Search. Next, Google \nCloud. Our complete enterprise AI product portfolio is accelerating growth in revenue, operating margins and backlog. In Q3, customer demand strengthened in 3 \nways. One, we are signing new customers faster. The number of new GCP customers increased by nearly 34% year-over-year. Two, we are signing larger deals. \nWe have signed more deals over $1 billion through Q3 this year than we did in the previous 2 years combined. Third, we are deepening our relationships. Over \n70% of existing Google Cloud customers use our AI products, including Banco BV, Best Buy and FairPrice Group. As we scale, we are diversifying revenue. \nToday, 13 product lines are each at an annual run rate over $1 billion. And we are improving operating margin with highly differentiated products built with our \nown technology. This deep product differentiation starts with our AI infrastructure. We have a decade of experience building AI accelerators and today, offer the \nwidest array of chips. This leadership is winning customers like HCA Healthcare, LG AI Research and Macquarie Bank, and it's why 9 of the top 10 AI labs \nchoose Google Cloud. We are also the only cloud provider offering our own leading generative AI models including Gemini, Imagen, Veo, Chirp and Lyria. \nAdoption is rapidly accelerating. In Q3, revenue from products built on our generative AI models grew more than 200% year-over-year. Over the past 12 months, \nnearly 150 Google Cloud customers each processed approximately 1 trillion tokens with our models for a wide range of applications. For example, WPP is \ncreating campaigns with up to 70% efficiency gains. Swarovski has increased e-mail open rates by 17% and accelerated campaign localization by 10x. Earlier \nthis month, we launched Gemini Enterprise, the new front door for AI in the workplace, and we are seeing strong adoption for agents built on this platform. Our \npackaged enterprise agents in Gemini Enterprise are optimized for a variety of domains, are highly differentiated and offer significant out-of-box value to\n\ncustomers. We have already crossed 2 million subscribers across 700 companies. Next, YouTube. In the living room, YouTube has remained #1 in streaming\nwatch time in the U.S. for more than 2 years, according to Nielsen. Last month marked YouTube's first time as a live NFL broadcaster. This exclusive global\nbroadcast live from Brazil drew more than 19 million fans and set a new record for most concurrent viewers of a live stream on YouTube. YouTube Shorts also\ncontinues to perform well. In the U.S., Shorts now earn more revenue per watch hour than traditional in-stream on YouTube. At our Made on YouTube event, we\nrolled out a number of AI-powered features that are helping create a supercharged creation and build their businesses. AI is now streamlining the entire content\ncreation workflow from generated video tools and more efficient editing to AI-powered insights that help creators optimize their channels. We are also using AI to\nexpand monetization, automatically identifying products to make their videos more shoppable. Philipp will discuss in more detail. And finally, Waymo, next year\nWaymo aims to open service in London, and they are working to bring service to Tokyo. They've also announced expansions to Dallas, Nashville, Denver and\nSeattle and secured permission to operate fully autonomously at San Jose and San Francisco Airports. Autonomous testing continues to scale in New York City.\nThe new Waymo for Business allows enterprises to offer Waymo as a work travel option. And we launched Waymo teens accounts in Phoenix this summer. We\nare pleased to see usage steadily increase with positive feedback from teens and their parents alike. Waymo's growth and momentum are strong, and 2026 is\nshaping up to be an exciting year. Overall, a milestone quarter, the incredible work of our teams is driving momentum across the board and our leadership in AI\npositions us so well for the opportunity ahead. I want to thank all of our partners and our employees for their hard work and an excellent Q3. With that, I'll turn it\nover to Philipp.", "char_count": 9632, "word_count": 1581, "token_count": 2045, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "GOOGL_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q3_u_0001", "company": "GOOGL", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2025, "period": "2025-Q3", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/GOOGL/GOOGL_FY2025_Q3.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

I'll quickly cover performance for Google Services for the quarter, then structure the rest of my remarks around the great\nprogress we're delivering across search, ads, YouTube and partnerships. Google Services revenues were $87 billion for the quarter, up 14% year-on-year driven\nby accelerated growth in Search and YouTube, partially offset by year-on-year decline in network revenues. Adding some further color to our results. The 15%\nincrease in Search and other was led by growth across all major verticals with the largest contributions from retail and financial services. YouTube saw similar\nperformance across verticals. Its 15% growth in advertising revenues was driven by direct response followed by brand. Starting with Search and other revenues,\nwhich delivered over $56 billion in revenue for the quarter. As Sundar mentioned, AI is driving an expansionary moment and transforming how people use Google\nSearch. Our investments in new AI experiences, such as AI Overviews and AI Mode, continued to drive growth in overall queries, including commercial queries,\ncreating more opportunities for monetization. These AI experiences are enhancing how people connect with businesses and shop on Search. We recently added\nshopping capabilities in AI Mode, which now help people shop conversationally in Search, and we expanded try-on capabilities to more clothing items, now\navailable to anyone in the U.S. Lastly, we're making it easier for consumers to benefit from deals through new loyalty offerings like personalized annotations on\norganic results and ads. Looking at monetization. Businesses can now tap into our most powerful AI search experiences. Using our most advanced AI models, we\ncan understand and predict intent like never before, unlocking entirely new commercial pathways to provide valuable new consumer connections and helping us\nmonetize even more efficiently. Rolled out globally in September, AI Max and Search is already used by hundreds of thousands of advertisers, currently making it\nthe fastest-growing AI-powered search ads product. In Q3 alone, AI Max unlocked billions of net new queries. By delivering the most relevant ad across surfaces\nand matching advertisers against additional queries they weren't reaching before, AI Max helps advertisers discover new customers at the exact moment they\nneed their product or service. Kayak, for example, look to grow conversions while staying within their ROAS goals. After turning on AI Max and Search, they grew\ntheir conversion value by 12% in early tests. We continue to infuse generative AI capabilities at every step of the marketing process. We rolled out Imagen 4 in\nAsset Studio and Product Studio, helping businesses produce more and better creatives. On the measurement front, we enriched the model supporting Meridian,\nour marketing mix model, with additional variables, and more granular reporting in PMax is making bidding more effective. Financial services company SoFi has\nbeen using PMax to meet its ambitious growth targets and help drive a 39% improvement in its conversion volume year-over-year. Moving to YouTube, where we\nsaw accelerated revenue growth. Our recommendation systems are driving robust watch time growth in our key monetization areas like shorts and living room. As\nwe leverage Gemini models, we're seeing further discovery improvement. On direct response, we're excited about the growth in revenue we're seeing, especially\nfrom small and medium advertisers adopting demand gen. We also improved performance on demand gen with over 100 launches helping to increase conversion\nvalue by more than 40% for advertisers using target-based bidding on YouTube. The retail vertical continues to lead our growth on YouTube with demand gen\nhelping us further monetize shopping-related categories. Looking at the living room, our long-term bet, more advertisers are adopting interactive direct response\nads, leading to an annual revenue run rate exceeding $1 billion globally for this format. For our viewers, we continue to give fans greater access across sports,\nwhile tapping into the best of YouTube's product innovation and creator-led content. Sundar mentioned that we expanded our NFL partnership with our first-ever\nexclusive global broadcast of an NFL game. Brands love the opportunity, and we sold all our ad inventory within a couple of weeks. Looking at creators. A\nsignificant force behind the thriving YouTube creator economy is the collaboration between creators and brands. Tools like direct linking to deals, websites and\nshorts and swappable brand segments in long form will soon help creators show how they deliver great value for brands. Thanks to a collaboration with Dude\nPerfect, Comcast, Xfinity drove an 8% search lift, beating other Xfinity ads, recall lift on shorts by 34%. At the same time, it decreased the cost per lifted user by\n50% when compared to the next most efficient ad. We continue to invest in AI-powered features that are helping creators supercharge creation and build their\nbusinesses. with Veo 3 integration and speech to song, creators go from idea to iteration quicker, and new channel insights help them better understand\nperformance. Ending on YouTube with our subscriptions product. We're also seeing momentum with strong growth in offerings such as YouTube Music and\nPremium and YouTube TV. We're also applying Gemini internally to help us serve customers with increased speed, intelligence and efficiency. Our sales teams\nuse Gemini enriched with ads knowledge to streamline customer interactions. This increased productivity by over 10% led to hundreds of millions in incremental\nrevenue and frees up sellers to engage with more customers at a deeper, more strategic level. In our customer support division, Gemini-powered solutions have\nmanaged over 40 million customer sessions so far this year and resolved hundreds of thousands of customer inquiries, and we're just getting started. As always,\nI'll wrap with the progress we're seeing across partnerships where our customers tap into the strength and breadth of Google's products to accelerate their\ntransformation. Revolut, the global financial services company, leverages Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform and Gemini models to help power its advanced\ncustomer service chatbot, develop new hyper-personalized financial products and offer predictive insights. Revolut is also increasing its presence on YouTube\nadopting Veo 3 for personalized creatives, making Google a key ads partner for delivering growth and launching new markets. In closing, I'd like to thank\nGooglers everywhere for their contributions to our success and as always, to our customers and partners for their continued trust. And of course, a huge thanks to\nall of you as we celebrate 25 years of Google Ads.

I will start with results at the Alphabet \nlevel and will then cover our segment results. I'll end with some commentary on our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2025. We had an outstanding quarter in Q3, \ncontinuing the strong momentum we've had throughout the year, delivering double-digit revenue growth across Search and YouTube advertising, subscriptions, \nplatforms and devices, and Google Cloud. Consolidated revenue reached $102.3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase or 15% in constant currency. Total cost \nof revenue was $41.4 billion, up 13%. TAC was $14.9 billion, up 8%. Other cost of revenues was $26.5 billion, up 16%, with the increase primarily driven by \ncontent acquisition costs largely for YouTube, followed by depreciation and other technical infrastructure operations costs. Total operating expenses increased\n\n28% to $29.7 billion. R&D expenses increased by 22%, driven by compensation, depreciation expenses related to our AI efforts. Sales and marketing expenses\nwere flat, and G&A expenses increased meaningfully, primarily due to the $3.5 billion charge related to the European Commission fine mentioned in the earnings\npress release. Operating income increased 9% this quarter to $31.2 billion, and operating margin was 30.5%. Excluding the EC fine, operating income increased\n22%, and operating margin was 33.9%. Operating margin benefited from strong revenue growth and continued efficiencies in our expense base, offset by the\nlegal charge and a significant increase in depreciation expense. Other income and expenses was $12.8 billion, primarily due to unrealized gains in our\nnonmarketable equity securities portfolio. Net income increased 33% to $35 billion, and earnings per share increased 35% to $2.87. We generated free cash flow\nof $24.5 billion in the third quarter and $73.6 billion for the trailing 12 months. Free cash flow in Q3 benefited from strong operating cash flow and recent tax\nchanges regarding the timing of when research and development costs are expensed and assets are depreciated. This was partially offset by higher CapEx. We\nended the quarter with $98.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Google Services revenues increased 14% to $87.1 billion,\nreflecting strength in Google Search, YouTube advertising and subscriptions. Google Search and other advertising revenues increased by 15% to $56.6 billion,\nrepresenting another robust quarter with continued growth across all major verticals with the largest contributions from retail and financial services. YouTube\nadvertising revenues increased 15% to $10.3 billion driven by direct response advertising, followed by brand. Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were\ndown 3%. Subscriptions, platforms and devices revenues increased 21% this quarter to $12.9 billion, driven by very strong growth in both YouTube and Google\nOne subscriptions. Google Services operating income increased 9% to $33.5 billion. Operating margin declined year-over-year to 38.5% as healthy revenue\ngrowth and continued efficiencies in our expense base were offset by the impact of the EC fine, which was fully reflected in the Google Services segment. Turning\nto the Google Cloud segment, which again delivered very strong results this quarter as cloud continued to benefit from our enterprise AI optimized stack, including\nour own custom TPUs and our industry-leading AI models. Cloud revenue increased by 34% to $15.2 billion in the third quarter, driven by strong performance in\nGCP, which continued to grow at a rate that was much higher than Cloud's overall revenue growth rate. GCP's growth was driven by enterprise AI products,\nwhich are generating billions in quarterly revenue. We had strong growth in enterprise AI infrastructure and enterprise AI solutions, which benefited from demand\nfor our industry-leading models, including Gemini 2.5. Core GCP was also a meaningful contributor to growth. And we had double-digit growth in Workspace,\nwhich was driven by an increase in average revenues per seat and the number of seats. Cloud operating income increased by 85% to $3.6 billion, and operating\nmargin increased from 17.1% in the third quarter last year to 23.7% this quarter. The expansion in Cloud operating margin was driven by strong revenue\nperformance and continued efficiencies in our expense base partially offset by higher technical infrastructure usage costs, which includes depreciation expense\nand other operations costs such as energy. Google Cloud's backlog increased 46% sequentially and 82% year-over-year, reaching $155 billion at the end of the\nthird quarter. The increase was driven primarily by strong demand for enterprise AI. As Sundar mentioned earlier, Cloud has signed more billion-dollar deals in\nthe first 9 months of 2025 than in the past 2 years combined.

The vast majority of our CapEx was invested in technical infrastructure with approximately 60% of that\ninvestment in servers and 40% in data centers and networking equipment. In Q3, we returned capital to shareholders through repurchases of stock of $11.5\nbillion and dividend payments of $2.5 billion. Turning to our outlook. I would like to provide some commentary on factors that will impact our business\nperformance in the fourth quarter of 2025 as well as an updated outlook for CapEx for the year. First, in terms of revenues, we're pleased with the overall\nmomentum of our business. At the current spot rates, we could see an FX tailwind to our revenues in Q4. However, the volatility in exchange rates could affect\nthe impact of FX on Q4 revenues. As for our segments, in Google Services, year-over-year comparisons in advertising will be negatively impacted by the strong\nspend on U.S. elections in the fourth quarter of 2024, particularly on YouTube. In Cloud, demand for our products remains high as evidenced by the accelerating\nrevenue growth and the $49 billion sequential increase in Cloud backlog in Q3. In GCP, we see strong demand for enterprise AI infrastructure, including TPUs\nand GPUs, enterprise AI solutions driven by demand for Gemini 2.5 and our other AI models, and core GCP infrastructure and other services such as\ncybersecurity and data analytics. As I've mentioned on previous earnings calls, while we have been working hard to increase capacity and have improved the\npace of server deployments and data center construction, we still expect to remain in a tight demand-supply environment in Q4 and 2026. Moving to investments.\nWe're continuing to invest aggressively due to the demand we're experiencing from Cloud customers as well as the growth opportunities we see across the\ncompany. We now expect CapEx to be in the range of $91 billion to $93 billion in 2025, up from our previous estimate of $85 billion, keeping in mind that the\ntiming of cash payments can cause variability in the reported CapEx number. Looking out to 2026, we expect a significant increase in CapEx, and we'll provide\nmore detail on our fourth quarter earnings call. In terms of expenses, first, as I've mentioned on the previous earnings calls, the significant increase in our\ninvestments in technical infrastructure will continue to put pressure on the P&L in the form of higher depreciation expenses and related data center operations\ncosts such as energy. In the third quarter, depreciation increased $1.6 billion year-over-year to $5.6 billion, reflecting a growth rate of 41%. Given the overall\nincrease in CapEx investments, we expect the growth rate in depreciation to accelerate slightly in Q4. Second, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be\nmore heavily weighted to the end of the year in part to support product launches and the holiday season. Q3 was a strong quarter, and we're excited with the\nadoption of our AI products helped by a rapid pace of innovation and great execution by our teams. This translated into strong momentum in Search, YouTube\nads, subscription, platforms and devices in Cloud, resulting in our first $100 billion-plus quarter.

Some of the areas are things that you've heard us talk\nabout in the past such as moderating the pace of head count growth, optimizing real estate footprint but also as we invest more and more in our technical\ninfrastructure, ensuring that we are optimizing that build-out and the overall technical infrastructure we have that a lot of the data centers, for example, that we\nbuild ourselves, so they're optimized and we make sure we do them in the most efficient way.

So I think it's important to\nseparate those 2 things.

Could you talk about what gives you confidence that it will also grow the addressable\nmarket for marketing activity and overall revenue associated with that behavior? That's question one. And question two is just more about as you think about AI\nMode, AI Overviews and traditional Google Search, how do you think -- do you see a world in 12 to 24 months, those all will exist? And does the user eventually\npick what mode they want? Is -- does the algorithm pick the mode?

Look, I think it's a dynamic moment, and I think we are meeting people in the moment with what they are trying to do. Obviously, search is evolving,\nand between AI Overviews and AI Mode, I think we are able to kind of give that range of experience for people in this moment. Over time, you will expect us to --\nyou can expect us to make the experiences simpler in a way that, just like we did universal search many, many years ago, we may have done text search, image\nsearch, video search, et cetera, and then we kind of brought it together as universal search. So you will see evolutions like that, but I think we want to be sensitive\nto making sure we are meeting the users in terms of what they are looking for. I think Gemini allows us to build a more personal, proactive, powerful AI assistant\nfor that moment. And I think having the 2 surfaces search in Gemini allows us to really serve users across the breadth of their needs. And -- but over time, we will\nthoughtfully look for opportunities to make the experience better for users. And to the first part, I would broadly say, as I do think we've been consistently saying\nfor a while now, this is an expansionary moment, and we are seeing people engage more. And I think when they do that, naturally, a portion of that information for\nusers, those journeys are commercial in nature.

The first on the on the pace of frontier model research and development. Look, I think 2 things are both simultaneously true. I'm incredibly\nimpressed by the pace at which the teams are executing and the pace at which we are improving these models. But it also is true at the same time that each of\nthe prior model you're trying to get better over is now getting more and more capable. So I think both the pace is increasing, but sometimes we are taking the time\nto put out a notably improved model, so I think -- and that may take slightly longer. But I do think the underlying pace is phenomenal to see. And I'm excited about\nour Gemini 3.0 release later this year. On cloud, I would point out as a sign of the momentum, I think the number of deals greater than $1 billion that we signed in\nthe first 3 quarters of this year are greater than the 2 years prior. So we are definitely seeing strong momentum, and we are executing at pace. And in terms of\nlong-term economics, I would say that, again, us being a full stack AI player and the fact that we are developing highly differentiated products on our own\ntechnology, I think, will help us drive a good trajectory here as you have seen over the past few years.\nOperator\nAnd that concludes our question-and-answer session for today.
