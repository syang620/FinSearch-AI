Joining me on today's call are Hock Tan, President and CEO; Kirsten Spears, Chief Financial Officer; and financial performance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the Investors section of\nBroadcom's website at broadcom.com. This conference call is being webcast live and an audio replay of the call can be accessed for one year through the\nInvestors section of Broadcom's website. During the prepared comments, Hock and Kirsten will be providing details of our third quarter fiscal year 2024 results,\nguidance for our fourth quarter fiscal year 2024, as well as commentary regarding the business environment. We'll take questions after the end of our prepared\ncomments. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual\nresults to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures\non a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made\nduring today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. I will now turn the call over to Hock. Thank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone for joining us today. In our fiscal Q3 2024, consolidated net revenue of $13.1 billion was up 47% year-on-year, and\noperating profit was up 44% year-on-year. These strong results reflected three key factors: one, AI revenue continues to grow and grow strongly; two, VMware\nbookings continue to accelerate; and three, non-AI semiconductor revenue has stabilized. Before I give you more color on our two reporting segments, let me\ngive you a quick update on guidance. Now we started the year providing annual guidance with quarterly updates as we run the process of integrating VMware.\nThings are now much more stable and we are in the first -- sorry, and we're in the final quarter of 2024. So instead of giving you annual guidance, we now revert\nto providing the quarterly guidance for Q4. Starting with software. In Q3, infrastructure software segment revenue of $5.8 billion was up 200% year-on-year driven\nby $3.8 billion in revenue contribution from VMware. The transformation of the business model of VMware continues to progress very well. In fact, last week, we\nheld a well-attended VMware Explore Conference in Las Vegas, our first as a combined company. This event was all about promoting VMware Cloud Foundation,\nor VCF, which is the full software stack that virtualizes an entire data center and creates a private cloud environment on-prem for enterprises. The success of this\nstrategy is reflected in our performance in fiscal Q3. We booked more than 15 million CPU costs of VCF, representing over 80% of the total VMware products we\nbooked during the quarter. And this translates into an annualized booking value, or ABV as I had described before, of $2.5 billion during Q3, up 32% from the\npreceding quarter. Meanwhile, we continue to drive down costs in VMware. We brought VMware spending down to $1.3 million in Q3 from $1.6 million in Q2. And\nwhen we acquired VMware, our target was to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $8.5 billion within three years of the acquisition. We are well on the path to achieving or\neven exceeding this EBITDA goal in the next fiscal '25. Now turning to semiconductors. In networking, Q3 revenue of $4 billion grew 43% year-on-year,\nrepresenting 55% of semiconductor revenue.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:46Z"}

And\nwhen we acquired VMware, our target was to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $8.5 billion within three years of the acquisition. We are well on the path to achieving or\neven exceeding this EBITDA goal in the next fiscal '25. Now turning to semiconductors. In networking, Q3 revenue of $4 billion grew 43% year-on-year,\nrepresenting 55% of semiconductor revenue. This was again driven by strong demand from hyperscalers for both AI networking and on custom AI accelerators.\nAs you know, our hyperscale customers continue to scale up and scale out their AI clusters. Custom AI accelerators grew 3.5 times year-on-year. In the fabric,\nEthernet switching, driven by Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI grew over 4 times year-on-year, while our optical lasers and PIN diodes used in optical interconnects\ngrew three-fold. Meanwhile, PCI Express switches more than doubled, and we're shipping in volume our industry-leading 5 nanometer, 400 gigabit per second\nNICs and 800 gigabit per second DSPs. So now let me give you more color on our networking products, which are not used in AI. As we had indicated last\nquarter, we believe we did bottom in Q2. And in Q3, non-AI networking was up actually 17% sequentially, even as it was down 41% year-on-year. We expect this\nlevel of revenue to sustain in Q4 and the year-on-year decline to moderate to 30%. So in adding the strength, we continue to see in AI, we expect total networking\nrevenue to grow over 40% year-on-year in Q4. Across enterprise infrastructure, we see the same trend of recovery in server storage. Our Q3 server storage\nconnectivity revenue was $861 million, up 5% sequentially and down 25% year-on-year. In Q4, we expect server storage revenue to grow mid to high-single digit\npercent sequentially, even as revenue is expected to be down high-single digit percent year-on-year. Moving on to wireless. Q3 wireless revenue of $1.7 billion\ngrew 1% year-on-year, representing 23% of semiconductor revenue. And in Q4, reflecting the launch of next-generation devices and our North American\ncustomers, we expect wireless revenue to actually grow over 20% sequentially even as it will be relatively flat year-on-year. On to broadband, Q3 revenue\ndeclined 49% year-on-year to $557 million, represented 8% of semiconductor revenue. Broadband remains weak on a continued pause in telco and service\nprovider spending. And in Q4, we expect broadband to continue to be down over 40% year-on-year, but we do expect that recovery to begin in '25. Finally, Q3\nindustrial resales of $164 million declined 31% year-on-year. We believe we are approaching bottom in Q3 as Q4 resales are expected to recover sequentially.\nYear-on-year, Q4 industrial resales will still be down approximately 20%. In summary, here are the trends we are seeing in semiconductors. In aggregate, we\nhave reached bottom in our non-AI markets and we're expecting a recovery in Q4. AI demand remains strong and we expect, in Q4, AI revenue to grow\nsequentially 10% to over $3.5 billion. This will translate to AI revenue of $12 billion for fiscal '24, up from our prior guidance of over $11 billion. Putting it all\ntogether with software, here's our forecast for Q4.

The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity\nof our $19 billion in floating rate debt is 6.7% and 3.1 years, respectively. We expect to repay approximately $1.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes due in Q4.\nTurning to capital allocation. In Q3, we paid stockholders $2.5 billion of cash dividends, which based on a split adjusted quarterly common stock count,\nrepresented a cash dividend of $0.525 per share. For Q4, we are rounding up the quarterly cash dividend to $0.53 per share. In Q3, the split adjusted non-GAAP\ndiluted share count was 4.92 billion, in line with expectations. We paid $1.4 billion of withholding taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the\nelimination of 8.4 million AVGO shares. In Q4, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be approximately 4.91 billion shares. Now on to guidance. Our\nguidance for Q4 is for consolidated revenue of $14 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 64%. For modeling purposes, we expect consolidated gross\nmargins to be down approximately 100 basis points sequentially on the higher revenue mix of semiconductors and product mix within semiconductors.

That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. Just a clarification, Hock, and then the question. So I think AI revenue roughly $3.1-ish billion in Q3, flattish sequentially. What was\nthe mix in terms of compute versus networking? And the $3.5 billion for Q4, what do you see of that mix? And then as we get into fiscal '25, I realize you're not\nguiding overall AI, but just how is your general kind of confidence and visibility? Do you think that Broadcom can kind of grow in line or better than the overall AI\nsilicon industry in fiscal '25? Yeah. Well, as we indicated in the last earnings call, for this past quarter, I think we're talking about two-thirds in compute and one-third in networking. And we\nkind of expect Q4 to run the similar trend. And as far to answer your second part, no, we don't guide \u2013 yet for fiscal \u201825, but we do expect fiscal \u201825 to continue to\nbe strong, to show strong growth on our AI revenue. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Hock, one of the things that we've picked up from both suppliers and the broader ecosystem in AI, I think we heard this\nfrom NVIDIA as well, that there was a shift in their revenue in the quarter, somewhat away from cloud service providers towards enterprise. And I wondered if that\nmight potentially have a slowing effect on your revenue outlook in this end market because your participation is really pretty focused on the cloud customers. I\nwonder if you're seeing that, if you view it as a challenge or maybe you have a contrary view? Thank you. Okay. Well, it's an interesting question in terms of the shift. But see, we do not focus very much on enterprise AI market as you know well. Our products in AI are\nlargely, very much largely focused, especially on the AI accelerator or XPU side, but even -- also just as much on networking side, on hyperscalers, on cloud,\nthose three large platform and some digital natives, what you call, big guys. We don\u2019t deal very much on AI with enterprise. So we obviously don\u2019t see that trend.\nOperator\nThank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I wanted to pivot over to the software side of things. Hock, it seems like, obviously, the VMware business had a great \nfiscal third quarter. It seems like the classic Broadcom software fell off.

Well, as far as we indicated, the VMware business continues to book very well, as we convert our customers very much in two ways, one, from perpetual to a\nsubscription license, but also those subscription license for the full stack of VCF. And that has been very successful, as I indicated, given the high ratio of VCF\nsubscribers, new subscribers that we have achieved. And we see this trend continuing in Q4 very much so and also very likely through into '25. So in terms of\ndirectional trend, other than the indication I\u2019m giving you \u2013 than the guidance I\u2019m giving you in Q4 \u201824, directionally, we continue to see accelerated bookings and\nby extension, accelerated growth.\nOperator\nThank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two short ones, one on each segments. On semis, the non-AI networking is like more than 50% below where it\nwas running before it rolled off. And clearly, the other businesses are also way below their peaks. Is there any reason why those shouldn't -- is this just cyclical or\nis something else going on? Is there any reason why those shouldn't get back to prior levels once recovery happens? And then on the software side. So the\nnon-VMware pieces looks like it's back to that $2 billion-ish a quarter level or so that it was at before. Is that just Brocade falling off? And is this sort of $2\nbillion-ish a quarter, is that bottomed as well? Is that the right level we ought to be thinking about the growth for the non-VMware software business as we go\nforward from here? Yeah. On the semi side, the answer is very simple. We have -- as you all know, we've gone through your typical down cycle of semiconductors. And I'm referring\nparticularly to non-AI, and we have talked about that before many times. We've gone through a down cycle. And as the ecosystem as many of our customers, but\nthe broad ecosystems work on an adjustment in inventory levels in all stages in the supply chain. And we're not totally -- we are not immune from it, obviously, as\nwe try to insulate ourselves from it as much as possible. We've gone through it and our -- the signs on the indications we have seen very clearly is we have, in\nfact, passed through the bottom. The best indicator is the bookings we are receiving. In non-AI, our bookings in Q3 of non-AI semiconductor demand is up 20%.\nAnd so also this -- we are well on the way to recovery. Now by end markets, as I indicated, the level of the amount of recovery, the timing of recovery somewhat\nvaries. But we're seeing largely on enterprise, enterprise data center, enterprise IT spending, we've passed the bottom. And we are, in Q3 was, in fact,\nsequentially, a recovery from the bottom of, we believe Q2 or Q1 this fiscal year. And we'll see Q4 continuing that recovery and obviously, in our view, into '25 in\nterms of the cycle. Broadband, we are not seeing it yet in terms of the bottom, but we see that as close to bottom in the sense that here again, bookings are up\nfrom where it used to be. And so we are very, very clear in our thinking that broadly, we have, as a whole, non-AI semiconductors, we've gone through the down\ncycle is on an uptick.

And like, all previous cycles, my sense, Stacy, is we will get us back to the level we used to be. There's no reason at all why it doesn't and\ngiven the rate of bookings, it won\u2019t go. I dare say even put a thought in your mind that as AI permeates enterprises all across and digital natives, you need to\nupgrade servers. You need to upgrade storage. You need to upgrade networking, connectivity across the entire ecosystem. And if anything else, we are headed\n-- we could be headed for up cycle. Timing precisely when, we\u2019re not sure. But an up cycle, that could even meet or even surpass what our previous up cycles\nwould be, simply because the amount of bandwidth you need, the amount of compete -- to manage store, manage all these workloads that come out of AI would\njust put -- need to refresh and upgrade hardware. So that\u2019s my $0.02 worth on where we\u2019re headed from this down cycle. So my belief in \u201824 was the lowest point\nfor the uptick. As part of the reasons we are stating it very clearly here. On the software side, your question, no, I think we have reached a level of stability that\nputs and takes Brocade, one of those goes up and down very volatile, and that\u2019s largely. But on the non-Vmware revenue, on software revenue, I think we\u2019ve\nreached a level of very clear stability. And what we are looking towards more is how Vmware picks up over the next several a year and 1.5 years. Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Hock.\nOperator\nThank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Your line is open. Hey. Thanks a lot for the question. Hock, I wanted to ask you about semiconductors, your AI revenue. If you could just clarify some of your comments. Was the\nthird quarter $3.1-ish billion in line with your expectations and it was anything weaker than expected? And then with the sequential growth, the 3.5, where are you\nexpecting that to come from? And then, if you don't mind, you said next year AI revenue should grow quite a bit. I was just wondering if that was due to any\nadditional customers, within your hyperscaler and consumer Internet portfolio? Thanks. Well, our number in third quarter is pretty much in line what we expect AI revenue to be. And our revenue in Q4 was -- forecast for Q4 is what's giving us the\nbasis to a large extent to step up our guidance for AI revenue for the full year to over $12 billion. So if nothing else, that continues to indicate, I hope to us, that\nnext year the trend will continue to be strong. And again, it's all largely hyperscalers, cloud, and digital natives. And it's again, a mix of AI accelerators and\nnetworking. And it's also largely based on backlog we have in place for that. Beyond that -- and it shows the growth. Beyond that, no, we're not guiding you\nbeyond the backlog we have. So I kind of answer your question indirectly on, do I have any more customers? We shall see. Okay.

One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Yes. Thank you. Curious, I was hoping you could speak to the relocation of IP back to the U.S. that is causing a $4.5 billion tax liability. Historically, Broadcom\nhas redomiciled ahead of a pending transaction, and I'm getting questions from investors, if this action may relate to any asset sales as the company seeks to pay\ndown debt. So if you could clarify that, that would be helpful? Thank you. Yeah. No, it was just the timing of when we chose to do it this time. And no, it doesn't have anything to do with that. It's just we relocated the IP and that caused\nthe $4 billion charge. The offset to that is a deferred tax liability, so think of that as non-cash, very little cash impact to that. Thank you.\nOperator\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. Thanks a lot. Hock, I wanted to ask about the growth rate in your AI revenue versus what we're seeing on the GPU side. Your AI revenue grew in the same zip\ncode this year is what the GPU compute is growing. And you did say that it would be up next year, but your main customer's ramping a new version of their\ncustom ASIC next year. And there's some thought that they might shift some of their purchasing back to GPUs next year. So do you think that the growth of your\nAI revenue should still approximately track how much GPU compute is going to grow next year? If you can give us any qualitative or quantitative thoughts there,\nthat would be great. Thank you. Tim, I think we had some communication gaps here. Could you repeat the question? Yeah. So the question, Hock, really is around the growth rate of your AI revenue versus what we're seeing on the GPU side because this year, you grew about\nthe same as what GPU compute's growing. And the question is, is there anything happening next year that would change that equation so that your growth rate of\nyour AI revenue would be materially different than what GPU compute is growing next year? That's a very difficult question for me to answer because it comes in two parts, right? In terms of GPU growth, you should ask the guys who does merchant GPU\nor GPU which is obviously, NVIDIA and ASD. And I don't see -- I don't play in the enterprise market at all. See, that's part of the market I don't see. Having said\nthat, they do both play somewhat in the hyperscalers, where I'm totally focused on doing. So that's really very -- there's really no connection one with the other,\nthat is indirect. But enough suffice for me to say long term, I\u2019m saying actually and thoughtfully long term, the large hyperscalers, few and large hyperscalers with\nvery large platforms, huge consumer platform subscriber base have the entire model predicated on running a lot of large language models, a lot of AI\nrequirements, workloads out there. And it will drive, matter of time, towards creating as much as possible their own compute silicon, their own custom\naccelerators as a matter of time. And we are in the midst of seeing that transition, which may take several \u2013 a few years for that to happen. So that is on a\ndifferent trajectory, a different path, and I\u2019m in that path of doing this, enabling custom accelerators. I\u2019m in that that. I\u2019m not in a path of, in the meantime, a\ndifferent trajectory of enabling enterprises to do AI on their own workloads. That\u2019s more the merchant guys.

Thank you, Hock.\nOperator\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nCJ Muse\nYeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to focus on software gross margin. So when you closed the acquisition of VMware, we ticked\nlower from low 90s to kind of high 80s. And we're now pushing a bit higher in July. And curious, as we kind of get to that $4 billion threshold and you've kind of\nindicated higher in fiscal '25, how should we think about the gross margin trajectory overall for software? Well, it's, for us, software gross margin is actually direct, it's not that relevant. You know that, right? So unless I'm running SaaS big time, now a lot of our\nproducts on subscription but they're not SaaS. We have some products on SaaS cloud-based, but most of them are not. And our gross margin will be around\n90% at least.\nOperator\nAnd one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Yes. Thank you. Good evening. I wonder if you could speak to the custom AI revenue and perhaps the contribution from some of the other customers aside from\nthat largest customer. How meaningful are the other customers in that segment and what do you expect into next year as some of those newer projects start to\nramp? Well, I know we're dancing around the thing, as I indicated, with three customers now going on and they're all three of them are meaningful. Otherwise, we won't\ncall them customers as the criteria we've used. Until we get meaningful shipments out to them on AI accelerators, we do not really consider that as a customer.\nSimply because it's a new -- this is an emerging trend. It's not an easy product to deploy for any customer. And so we do not consider proof of concepts as\nproduction volume. These are all production accelerators deployed in AI data centers of those three customers.\nOperator\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Your line is open. Hi. Thanks for the question. My question is actually on storage. And Hock, you bought Seagate's hard disk drive SoC assets earlier in the year. Can you talk\nabout what you actually bought there, what it means in terms of economics for your company, and whether this accelerates your storage business over the next\nfew years? Thanks. Well, this is more of a partnership than anything else. Basically, it's what we essentially created in that transaction was to begin with, we actually believe long term\nin the sustainability of hard disk drive media as a great long-term sustainable storage, alternative storage or medium for those hyperscalers. It makes sense. One\nway to think eventually, everything goes to flash, don't think so. Hard disk drive storage will still be meaningful.

Now in terms of base technology\nwe developed, of course, it could be used, it could be applied, and we are very happy to share that with \u2013 as it may be useful to get \u2013 to enable Blackwell to be\npart of that, whether it\u2019s on the optical component side, which is what you\u2019re referring to, or even on the DSP side in terms of providing the interconnects to enable\nclusters of Blackwell to be built.

Joe, that's a beautiful question. I'll tell it is bluntly so they're not disappointed. Right now, I'm having my hands really full and enjoying myself doing is on really\nturning, transforming the business model of VMware. It's a great experience and you're feeling great about it when you do and when you're doing it pretty much\nrunning way beyond expectation as we indicated in that side.

Hock, last quarter, you talked about an acceleration in R&D investments by your AI customers, and you talked\nabout your follow-on wins for their next-generation XPU ASIC programs. It also looks like they're trying to accelerate their deployments of their GPUs, XPUs, and\nnetworking into their data centers here in the second half of the year. We know that on AI accelerators specifically, supply is quite tight, given the colos packaging\nand the HBM memory constraints. So has the team seen upside orders and demand for XPUs and networking here in the second half? Have you been able to\nmeet that upside demand or is the team somewhat supply constrained? I guess in other words, is the AI demand greater than your supply here in the second half\nof the year? Yeah. We continue to see orders. We continue to see upside. And you're right in the pattern of that behavior that is going because it's -- as our customers, these\nare hyperscalers trying to deploy more and more capacity of AI data centers -- in AI data centers. And you start to hear them talk in terms of power. They don't\neven talk in terms of how many XPU or GPU plus they found in the 500 megawatt, 1 gigawatt was no but people that.

Thanks.\nOperator\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Your line is open. Thank you very much. Hock, that was a perfect segue into my question. You've said in the past calls that you thought that AI compute would move away from\nASICs and go to merchant market. But it looks like the trend is kind of heading the other way. Are you still the opinion that, that's going to be the long-term trend\nof this? And secondly, as you just pointed out, power is becoming the defining factor for deployment with all the big guys at this point. Given the performance per\nwatt of the ASICs over GPUs, which is superior to GPUs, why shouldn't we see more of these guys moving to custom ASIC? I know it takes a long time and it\ntakes a lot of funding, etc. But especially as the enterprise starts getting more involved with this, there are going to be some applications that are kind of standard\nacross some of the enterprises wouldn't even see some of the bigger, like AWS, move to a custom silicon for a specific workload. So basically, the overall trend in\nASICs in AI. Thanks. Okay. Ed, did I hear you right to say at the beginning, maybe you meant that there is a trend towards ASIC or XPU from general purpose GPU, right? You're right, and you're correct in pointing out to me that, hey, I used to think that general purpose merchant silicon will win at the end of the day. Well, based on\nhistory of semiconductors mostly so far, general purpose, small merchant silicon tends to win. But like you, I flipped in my view. And I did that, by the way, last\nquarter, maybe even 6 months ago. But nonetheless, catching up is good. And I actually think so because I do think there are two markets here on AI\naccelerators. There's 1 market for enterprises of the world, and none of these enterprises are incapable nor have the financial resources or interest to create the\nsilicon, the custom silicon, nor the large language models or the software and going maybe to be able to run those AI workloads on custom silicon. It's too much\nand there's no return for them to do it because it's just too expensive to do it. But there are those few cloud guys, hyperscalers with the scale of the platform and\nthe financial wherewithal for them to make it probably rational, economically rational, to create their own custom accelerators because it's all -- right now, not\ngoing to -- not trying to emphasize", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:46Z"}

It's all about especially training those large language models and enabling it on your platform.\nIt's all about constraint, to a large part, about GPUs. Seriously, it came to a point where GPUs are more important than engineers, these hyperscalers in terms of\nhow they think. Those GPUs are much more -- XPUs are much more important. And if that's the case, what better thing to do than bringing the control and the\ncontrol of their own destiny by creating your own custom silicon accelerators. And that's what I'm seeing all of them do. It's just doing it at different rates and do --\nand they're starting at different times but they all have started. And obviously, it takes time to get there. But they're all -- a lot of them, there are a lot of learning in\nthe process versus what the biggest guy of them who had longer have been doing for seven years. Others are trying to catch up and it takes time. I'm not saying\nyou'll take seven years. I think you'll be accelerated, but it will still take some time step by the time to get there. But those few hyperscalers, platform guys will\ncreate their own if they haven't already done it and start to train them on the large language models. And that is, yes, you're right, they will on go in that direction\ntotally into ASIC or, as we call it, XPUs, custom silicon. Meanwhile, there's still a market for in enterprise for merchant silicon. Right. But that basically suggests that you're on the early part of your curve where I'm not trying to call the GPUs whatever, but you could be getting to something\ncloser to the peak of the GPU market just because everything, right, beside the cost expense and as you're spending all this money and you're paying all this\nmoney for power, the ASICs become more and more attractive.
