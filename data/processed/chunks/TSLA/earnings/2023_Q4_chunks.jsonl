Good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. First, I'm wondering if you can just walk through some of the gating factors required to unlock your\nnext-gen platform. You talked about a number of cost initiatives back at the Investor Day a year ago, things in manufacturing and powertrain. Maybe you can just\ngive us a sense of where these initiatives stand. And do you believe -- we know that there's a number of new features and technologies in Cybertruck, things like\n48 volts architecture, really employing your 4680 batteries. To what extent do you think Cybertruck is really a proving ground for the next-gen platform and is\nreally going to be a gating factor to unlocking the cost reductions needed for the next-gen platform?", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:13:22Z"}

In addition, you have the hourly wage increase. I guess we'll add to that into next year. And I thought you said raw material costs are kind or -- that\nbenefit is sort of almost played out. So is there an opportunity to continue to go below the 36,000, or should we kind of be modeling that it kind of stays at this\nlevel into '24?", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:13:22Z"}
