This increase was primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. Federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction, and a non-deductible EC fine, partially offset by changes in prior period tax positions. The effective tax rate increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2025. This increase was primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. Federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction, a non-deductible EC fine and legal settlement in the U.S., a decrease in SBC-related tax benefits, partially offset by changes in prior period tax positions. Changes to U.S. tax law enacted on July 4, 2025, allow for immediate expensing of domestic research and experimentation costs, accelerated depreciation on eligible capital expenditures, and other tax law changes impacting 2025 with certain changes effective in 2026. These changes are reflected in our results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%. Some countries have already implemented the legislation effective January 1, 2024, and we expect others to follow, however this did not have a material effect on our income tax provision for the period ending September 30, 2025. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities As of September 30, 2025, we had $98.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity securities. Sources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to stockholders.

In Google Services, we also generate cash through consumer subscriptions, the sale of apps and in-app purchases, and devices. In Google Cloud, we generate cash through consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, applications, and other cloud services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network partners, to employees for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities include payments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures. Net cash provided by operating activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2025 due to an increase in cash received from customers, partially offset by an increase in cash payments for cost of revenues and operating expenses. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities.

Net cash used in investing activities increased from the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2025 primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment, driven by investments in technical infrastructure, and a decrease in maturities and sales of marketable securities. Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of interests in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, payment of dividends, and repayments of debt. Net cash used in financing activities decreased from the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2025 due to an increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments. Liquidity and Material Cash Requirements We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months, and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Capital Expenditures and Leases We make investments in land, buildings, and servers and network equipment through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products. Capital Expenditures Our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories: \u2022technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, storage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, and data center land and building construction; and \u2022office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\").

In April 2025, the Board of Directors of Alphabet increased the quarterly cash dividend by 5% to $0.21 per share of outstanding Class A, Class B, and Class C shares. The company has declared a quarterly cash dividend in the current quarter, and intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the company\u2019s Board of Directors in its sole discretion. European Commission Fines In 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European competition law and imposed fines of \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018) and \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. In September 2022, the General Court affirmed the EC decision but reduced the 2018 fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation of the EC decision with the European Court of Justice, which remains pending. In September 2024, the EU's General Court overturned the 2019 decision and annulled the \u20ac1.5 billion fine. The EC has appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice. In September 2025, the EC announced its decision that Google had infringed European competition laws through \u201cself-preferencing\u201d practices on the buy-side and the sell-side relating to its advertising technology. The EC imposed a \u20ac3.0 billion fine ($3.5 billion as of September 5, 2025), which was accrued in the third quarter of 2025. We included the outstanding EC fines, including any under appeal, in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As of September 30, 2025, we had long-term income taxes payable of $10.1 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions. Purchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations We have material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations primarily related to energy contracts, licenses (including content licenses), and technical infrastructure and inventory orders. As of September 30, 2025, the total for these commitments was $93.7 billion, of which $72.5 billion was short-term, mostly related to technical infrastructure and inventory orders. These amounts reflect commitments and obligations through open purchase orders as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of September 30, 2025. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change based on the expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content licenses, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and energy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar commitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not readily determinable. We may experience increases in the costs associated with our purchase commitments and other contractual obligations as a result of ongoing developments surrounding international trade.

Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2025, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
