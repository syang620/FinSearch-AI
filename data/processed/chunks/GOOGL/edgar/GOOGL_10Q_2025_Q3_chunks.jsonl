STATEMENTS Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Unaudited Interim Financial Information These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2025. We have made estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. These consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the SEC. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:15Z"}

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes. Upon adoption, we will be required to disclose additional specified categories in the rate reconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. We will also be required to disclose the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. The standard, which is effective for our 2025 annual period, can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively and we are currently assessing which method to adopt. In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 \"Income Statement: Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)\" to improve the disclosures about an entity\u2019s expenses. Upon adoption, we will be required to disclose in the notes to the financial statements a disaggregation of certain expense categories included within the expense captions on the face of the income statement. The standard is effective for our 2027 annual period, and our interim periods beginning in 2028, with early adoption permitted. The standard can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently assessing adoption timing and the effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures. Prior Period Reclassifications Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. | | | | |   \n---|---|---|---|---|--- Disaggregated Revenues The following table presents revenues disaggregated by type (in millions): | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n| Three Months Ended| | Six Months Ended  \n| June 30,| | June 30,  \n| 2024| | 2025| | 2024| | 2025  \nGoogle Search & other| $| 48,509 | | | $| 54,190 | | | $| 94,665 | | | $| 104,892 |   \nYouTube ads| 8,663 | | | 9,796 | | | 16,753 | | | 18,723 |   \nGoogle Network| 7,444 | | | 7,354 | | | 14,857 | | | 14,610 |   \nGoogle advertising| 64,616 | | | 71,340 | | | 126,275 | | | 138,225 | Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices | 9,312 | | | 11,203 | | | 18,051 | | | 21,582 |   \nGoogle Services total| 73,928 | | | 82,543 | | | 144,326 | | | 159,807 |   \nGoogle Cloud| 10,347 | | | 13,624 | | | 19,921 | | | 25,884 |   \nOther Bets| 365 | | | 373 | | | 860 | | | 823 |   \nHedging gains (losses)| 102 | | | (112)| | | 174 | | | 148 |   \nTotal revenues| $| 84,742", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:15Z"}

As of June 30, 2025, we had $108.2 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately 55% of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2024 was $6.0 billion, of which $3.5 billion was recognized as revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2025. Total deferred revenue as of June 30, 2025 was $6.8 billion. Note 3. Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within | | | | |   \n---|---|---|---|---|--- Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. Debt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts. The following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions): | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n| | | | As of December 31, 2024  \n| | Fair Value Hierarchy| | Adjusted Cost| | Gross Unrealized Gains| | Gross Unrealized Losses| | Fair Value| | Cash and Cash Equivalents| | Marketable Securities  \nFair value changes recorded in other comprehensive income| | | | | | | | | | | | | |   \nTime deposits| | Level 2| | $| 2,217 | | | $| 0 | | | $| 0 | | | $| 2,217 | | | $| 2,081 | | | $| 136 |   \nGovernment bonds| | Level 2| | 27,551| | 83 | | | (214)| | | 27,420 | | | 50 | | | 27,370 |   \nCorporate debt", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:16Z"}

Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, and common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.

In the table above, realized net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later. Cumulative net gains (losses) on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following table (in millions), represents the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity security sold during the period. While these net gains (losses) may have been reflected in periods prior to the period of sale, we believe they are important supplemental information as they reflect the economic net gains (losses) on the securities sold during the period. Cumulative net gains (losses) are calculated as the difference between the sale price and the initial purchase price for the equity security sold during the period. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n| Three Months Ended", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:16Z"}

These gains were recognized in OI&E within the Consolidated Statement of Income. See Note 7 for further details on OI&E. Derivative Financial Instruments We use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns. We recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values. The accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation. We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States (U.S.) dollar. These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less. Cash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. As of June 30,", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:16Z"}

primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. We may continue to fund ongoing operations of certain VIEs that are included within Other Bets. As of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, total noncontrolling interests (NCI) in our consolidated subsidiaries were $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion was redeemable noncontrolling interests (RNCI) in each period. NCI and RNCI are included within additional paid-in capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 7 for further details on OI&E. We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments, which are included within non-marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments. As of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, our future funding commitments related to unconsolidated VIE investments were $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $25.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had $2.3 billion and $3.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, respectively, with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 4.4% in each period. The estimated fair value of the commercial paper approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025. Our short-term debt balance also includes the current portion of certain long-term debt. In May 2025, we issued $5.0 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-rate senior unsecured notes in four tranches: $750 million of 4.00% notes due 2030, $1.25 billion of 4.50% notes due 2035, $1.5 billion of 5.25% notes due 2055, and $1.5 billion of 5.30% notes due 2065. Additionally in May 2025, we issued \u20ac6.75 billion of euro-denominated fixed-rate senior unsecured notes in five tranches: \u20ac1.5 billion of 2.50% notes due 2029, \u20ac1.5 billion of 3.00% notes due 2033, \u20ac1.25 billion of 3.38% notes due 2037, \u20ac1.25 billion of 3.88% notes due 2045, and \u20ac1.25 billion of 4.00% notes due 2054.

Commitments and Contingencies We have content licensing agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of $8.2 billion as of June 30, 2025, of which the majority is paid quarterly through the first quarter of 2030. In the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate activities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, distribution partners, customers of Google Cloud offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to defend and/or indemnify certain parties against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents. It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. As of June 30, 2025, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Certain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial changes to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect. We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred. We are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations as well as litigation on various competition matters by regulatory authorities and private parties in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally, including the following: \u2022Shopping: In June 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google relating to its display and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European antitrust laws and imposed a \u20ac2.4 billion fine. In 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the fine. \u2022Android: In July 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related distribution agreements infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion fine, and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. We appealed the EC decision and implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. In September 2022, the General Court affirmed the EC decision but reduced the fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation of the EC decision with the European Court of Justice, which remains pending. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:16Z"}

We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation of the EC decision with the European Court of Justice, which remains pending. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022. \u2022AdSense for Search: In March 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google's agreements with AdSense for Search partners infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a fine of \u20ac1.5 billion, and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. In 2019, we recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine and appealed the EC decision. In September 2024, the General Court overturned the EC decision and annulled the \u20ac1.5 billion fine. The EC has appealed the General Court's decision with the European Court of Justice. \u2022Search: In October 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. In August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google violated such U.S. antitrust laws. A separate proceeding to determine remedies, the range of which vary widely, concluded in May 2025. The DOJ's remedy proposal included alterations to our products and services and our business models and operations, including structural remedies, and our distribution arrangements, among other changes, some of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We expect a decision on remedies in August 2025, after which we intend to appeal the August 2024 ruling and, potentially, aspects of the remedies decision following our review of that decision. Further, in June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and in October 2023, the Japanese Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices. In April 2025, the JFTC issued a cease-and-desist order requiring us to make changes to our Android agreements to ensure they are consistent with Japanese antitrust law. The JFTC did not impose monetary penalties. We are constructively engaging with JFTC regarding compliance with the order. Given the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss. \u2022Advertising Technology: In December 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. A trial will take place after a decision on remedies is issued in the following DOJ case against Google relating to its advertising technology. In January 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology, and a number of additional state Attorneys General subsequently joined the lawsuit. In April 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a mixed decision in the DOJ case against Google, ruling that the DOJ failed to show that Google\u2019s advertiser tools or acquisitions of DoubleClick and AdMeld were anticompetitive, but that Google\u2019s publisher tools violated antitrust laws by excluding rivals.

advertising technology, and a number of additional state Attorneys General subsequently joined the lawsuit. In April 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a mixed decision in the DOJ case against Google, ruling that the DOJ failed to show that Google\u2019s advertiser tools or acquisitions of DoubleClick and AdMeld were anticompetitive, but that Google\u2019s publisher tools violated antitrust laws by excluding rivals. A separate proceeding to determine remedies, the range of which vary widely, is scheduled to take place in September 2025. The DOJ's remedy proposal includes structural remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We also filed a remedy proposal ahead of the September proceedings. After a decision on remedies, we plan to appeal the adverse portion of the April 2025 decision and, potentially, aspects of the remedies decision following our review of that decision. Further, in June 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology, to which we responded. In September 2024, the UK also issued a Statement of Objections on similar grounds, to which we responded. Given the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss. \u2022Google Play: In July 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement in principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories and recognized a charge. Final approval of the settlement remains pending before the court. In May 2024, we funded the settlement amount to an escrow agent. In December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws related to Google Play's business. Epic did not seek monetary damages. The presiding judge issued a remedies decision in October 2024, ordering a variety of alterations to our business models and operations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing the verdict and the trial court judge temporarily paused the implementation of the remedies while the Court of Appeals considers our request to pause implementation of the remedies pending the duration of the appeal. Given the nature of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible loss.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:16Z"}

the EC opened two investigations regarding Google's compliance with certain provisions of the European Union's (EU) Digital Markets Act relating to Google Play and Search. In March 2025, the EC issued preliminary findings of non-compliance in both investigations, to which we responded. Given the nature of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible loss. In addition to these antitrust proceedings, private individual and collective actions that overlap with claims pursued by regulatory authorities are pending in the U.S. and in several other jurisdictions, including across Europe. Given the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss. We believe we have strong arguments against these open claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world. We are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations and litigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information, alleged violations of state biometric statutes, the choices we offer users, and advertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes. In April 2025, we reached a $1.4 billion agreement in principle to settle certain privacy matters. Patent and Intellectual Property Claims We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products. Further, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business. We are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, AI training, and other matters. For example, we periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. We have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, some matters concern civil judgments that include compounding penalties imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of sanctioned parties. We do not expect these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect. We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters.

In April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares. In April 2025, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of Class A and Class C shares. As of June 30, 2025, $86.3 billion remained available for Class A and Class C share repurchases.

\u2022Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, applications, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services. \u2022Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of autonomous transportation services, healthcare-related services and internet services. Revenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue. Certain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include certain AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and office space reductions are also not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our Chief Executive Officer, Sundar Pichai. Our CODM uses segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to our segments in our annual planning process and to assess the performance of our segments, primarily by monitoring actual results versus the annual plan. Our operating segments are not evaluated using asset information. The following table presents revenue, profitability, and expense information about our segments (in millions):| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n| Three Months Ended| | Six Months Ended  \n| June 30,| | June 30,  \n| 2024| | 2025| | 2024| | 2025  \nRevenues:| | | | | | |   \nGoogle Services| $| 73,928 | | | $| 82,543 | | | $| 144,326 | | | $| 159,807 |   \nGoogle Cloud| 10,347 | | | 13,624 | | | 19,921 | | | 25,884 |   \nOther Bets| 365 | | | 373 | | | 860 | | | 823 |   \nHedging gains (losses)| 102 | | | (112)| | | 174 | | | 148 |   \nTotal revenues| $| 84,742 | | | $| 96,428 | | | $| 165,281 | | | $| 186,662 |   \nOperating income (loss):| | | | | | |   \nGoogle Services| $| 29,674 | | | $| 33,063 | | | $| 57,571 | | | $| 65,745 |   \nGoogle Cloud| 1,172 | | | 2,826 | | | 2,072 | | | 5,003 |   \nOther Bets| (1,134)| | | (1,246)| | | (2,154)| | | (2,472)| Alphabet-level activities | (2,287)| | | (3,372)| | | (4,592)| | |", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:16Z"}

For further details on our segments, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Revenues and Monetization Metrics We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. For additional information on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. In addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business discussed in \"Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect\" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including: \u2022changes in foreign currency exchange rates; \u2022changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives; \u2022general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending; \u2022new product, service, and market launches; and Additionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising (\"Google advertising\"), other sources (\"Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices\"), Google Cloud, and Other Bets have been, and may continue to be, affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below. Google Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues. Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following: \u2022Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play; \u2022YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and \u2022Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. We use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while impressions and cost-per-impression pertain to traffic on our Google Network properties. Paid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on Google search properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play. Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users. Impressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users. As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions,", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:17Z"}

revenues Google Search & other Google Search & other revenues increased $5.7 billion and $10.2 billion from the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2025. The overall growth was driven by interrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage on mobile devices; growth in advertiser spending; and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery. YouTube ads revenues increased $1.1 billion and $2.0 billion from the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 to the three and six months ended June 30, 2025. The growth was driven by our direct response advertising products followed by our brand advertising products, both of which benefited from increased spending by our advertisers. Google Network revenues decreased $90 million from the three months ended June 30, 2024 to the three months ended June 30, 2025, primarily due to a decrease in AdSense and Google Ad Manager revenues, partially offset by an increase in AdMob revenues. Google Network revenues decreased $247 million from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30, 2025, primarily due to a decrease in Google Ad Manager revenues and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in AdSense revenues.

The growth was primarily driven by an increase in subscription revenues. This increase was primarily due to the contribution from growth in paid subscriptions across both YouTube services and Google One.

Use of Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information International revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. Constant currency information compares results between periods", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:17Z"}

our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period. Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

Provision for Income Taxes The following table presents provision for income taxes (in millions, except effective tax rate): | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n| Three Months Ended| | Six Months Ended  \n| June 30,| | June 30,  \n| 2024| | 2025| | 2024| | 2025  \nIncome before provision for income taxes| $| 27,551 | | | $| 33,933 | | | $| 55,866 | | | $| 75,722 |   \nProvision for income taxes| $| 3,932 | | | $| 5,737 | | | $| 8,585 | | | $| 12,986 |   \nEffective tax rate| 14.3 | %| | 16.9 | %| | 15.4 | %| | 17.1 | % The effective tax rate increased from the three months ended June 30, 2024 to the three months ended June 30, 2025. This increase was primarily due to a decrease in SBC-related tax benefits, and a non-deductible legal settlement in the U.S., partially offset by changes in prior period tax positions. The effective tax rate increased from the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30, 2025. This increase was primarily due to a decrease in SBC-related tax benefits, lower effective tax rate impacts in the U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction, and a non-deductible legal settlement in the U.S., partially offset by changes in prior period tax positions. On July 4, 2025, the OBBBA was signed into law. This legislation includes changes to U.S. federal tax law, which may be subject to further clarification and the issuance of interpretive guidance. We are assessing the legislation and its effect on our consolidated financial statements, which we expect to begin reflecting in the three month period ended September 30, 2025. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%. Some countries have already implemented the legislation effective January 1, 2024, and we expect others to follow, however this did not have a material effect on our income tax provision for the period ending June 30, 2025. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities As of June 30, 2025, we had $95.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity securities. Sources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to stockholders.

Capital Expenditures and Leases We make investments in land, buildings, and servers and network equipment through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products. Capital Expenditures Our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories: \u2022technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, storage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, and data center land and building construction; and \u2022office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\"). Assets not yet in service are those that are not ready for our intended use, including assets in the process of construction or assembly, and consists primarily of technical infrastructure. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with multiple phases, where we acquire land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install servers and network equipment. During the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025, we spent $25.2 billion and $39.6 billion on capital expenditures, respectively. We expect to increase, relative to 2024, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when such assets are ready for our intended use. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025, depreciation on property and equipment was $7.1 billion and $9.5 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2025, the amount of total future lease payments under operating and finance leases was $17.4 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2025, we have entered into leases primarily related to data centers that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $23.9 billion. These leases will commence between 2025 and 2031 with non-cancelable lease terms between one and 25 years. For additional information on leases, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $25.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2025, we had $3.0 billion of short-term commercial paper outstanding.

In the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, total cash dividends were $1.2 billion and $2.4 billion for Class A, $178 million and $350 million for Class B, and $1.1 billion and $2.2 billion for Class C shares, respectively. In April 2025, the Board of Directors of Alphabet increased the quarterly cash dividend by 5% to $0.21 per share of outstanding Class A, Class B, and Class C shares. The company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the company\u2019s Board of Directors in its sole discretion. European Commission Fines In 2018 and 2019, the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European competition law and imposed fines of \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018) and \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019), respectively. In September 2022, the General Court affirmed the EC decision but reduced the 2018 fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation of the EC decision with the European Court of Justice, which remains pending. In September 2024, the EU's General Court overturned the 2019 decision and annulled the \u20ac1.5 billion fine. The EC has appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice. We included the outstanding EC fines, including any under appeal, in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As of June 30, 2025, we had long-term income taxes payable of $10.0 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions. Purchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations As of June 30, 2025, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $72.5 billion, of which $51.0 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain technical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory, and network capacity. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of June 30, 2025. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change based on the expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content licenses, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and energy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar commitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not readily determinable. We may experience increases in the costs associated with our purchase commitments and other contractual obligations as a result of ongoing developments surrounding international trade.

ITEM 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2025, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
