You obviously have a lot of irons in the fire here. You've\nbeen talking about some of the early momentum with tens of thousands of advertisers. The question is, can you sort of walk us through some of the hurdles and\ngating factors that we should be thinking through that dictate the pace at which these tools can really be rolled out broadly just so we and advertisers can kind of\nget an understanding for when they could have a bigger impact on the whole business?

Sundar, a bigger-picture question, coming back to your comments earlier in the call on Search Generative Experience. When you think about the\nevolution of product over the next couple of years, how do you envision more traditional search and things like the Google Assistant continuing to evolve in a\nworld of Search Generative Experience and Bard and what that might mean for elements of commercial and non-commercial search and how use cases might\nchange in the years ahead? And then, Ruth, I just want to make sure we understood some of the messaging from the release and the public comments around\none-timers in the quarter itself. It seems as if they were not allocated to the segments but are more elements of Other Bets and Alphabet-level activities. I just\nwant to confirm whether elements of those one-timers were captured in the P&L statement and whether there were also any elements of legal one-timers that\nwould be called out this quarter as well?", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:14:35Z"}

Digging back to 2019,\nyour business has, I think, more than doubled since then. So I guess, as we sit here today in early 2024, how do you feel about Google's ability to drive Search\nRPM going forward?

On Cloud first, there's just this volatility, this material deceleration last quarter and the nice reacceleration this\nquarter. Is that explained by where we are in the optimization cycle, and it may be generative AI workloads starting to trickle in now and cause that growth curve\nto bend back up? Any commentary just on the sort of the volatility, the deceleration and the reacceleration that we've seen? And then, Philipp, I wanted to ask on\nthe creative side, and particularly on YouTube and ads and the creative, using AI to improve the creative and really to offer SMBs who have been with Google\nforever but offer them now performance-based video ad campaigns created by AI. Is that kind of a new growth area? How far along are you in terms of offering\nthis out into the market?
