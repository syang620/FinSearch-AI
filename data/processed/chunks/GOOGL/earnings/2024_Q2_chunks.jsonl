I guess we're sort of 18 months this fever pitch around the GenAI focus in the world. Maybe from any of your perspective, can \nyou just sort of talk to us about areas where you've seen faster than expected traction or testing adoption of some of the AI, generative AI capabilities versus \nslower than expected traction and testing from a Google perspective. And then, Ruth I appreciate all the comments about structurally reengineering the OpEx \nbase. Are there any more tangible examples of areas you can talk to us about where you still see further ways to drive more efficiency across the company.\n\nThanks.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:14:35Z"}

Just two questions on the AI CapEx. So it looks like from the outside at least, the hyperscaler industry is going from kind of an under bill situation\nthis time last year to better meeting the demand with capacity right now to potentially being overbuilt next year if these CapEx growth rates keep up. So do you\nthink that's a fair characterization? And how are we thinking about the return on invested capital with this AI CapEx cycle. And then related to that, do you think\nthat the AI industry is close to or far away from hitting some kind of wall on foundation model improvement in AI training, based on like lack of availability of new\ndata to train on. Just your thoughts on that would be great. Thank you.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:14:35Z"}
