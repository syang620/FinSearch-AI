So first, Sundar, given the high stakes around native AI product usage, are\nthere any milestones you can share around where Gemini usage is compared to the 250 million weekly active users that ChatGPT is seeing right now? And then\nthe second question is, I'm sure this is something you guys have been thinking about for a while, but it looks like the way that the Google versus DOJ search trial\nis going, there's a decent likelihood that the Apple ISA contract and some of the Android pre-install contracts are going to be voided out at some point in the\nfuture. So I guess the question is, what plans do we have in place to recapture some of the usage that might be going away in those search access points?

I'd like to ask two questions, please, to Anat. First, the margins at cloud have really started to ramp nicely. There are comps in the industry with still\nmaterially higher operating margins. I imagine that's a matter of scale and trying to catch up from a third place position. But how do you think about the margin\ntrends that you're seeing? And what's your level of confidence that those margins can kind of match up to other industry players that are doing closer to 30%\nmargins? And then secondly, just across the board, when you think about the business that's running at, what, 32% operating margins this last quarter, and you\ncome in looking at this fresh, is it clear to you that there are a lot of kind of newfound cost efficiencies or ongoing cost efficiencies? Like what do you see as the\nbiggest opportunities to kind of take those margins and maybe over time, take them materially higher? Thank you very much.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:14:36Z"}

Two, if I may. First, just on search, why does it make sense to have completely - why doesn't it make sense to have two completely different\nsearch experiences. One, an agent-like answers engine, and then two, a links-based more traditional search engine. You could innovate on both and let the\nconsumer decide. It's - maybe think of it as the ultimate A/B test. So I'd be curious to get your thoughts there. And then the second, if you could touch a little bit on\nthe consumer environment in 4Q. Perhaps nobody has a better view into the health of the consumer in multiple verticals. If you could talk a little bit about - you\ntalked about tougher comps on the Asia e-commerce side, but any other trends you could point out be around the election or fewer holiday days this year, that\nwould be really helpful.

Hi, Sundar. I think in two separate blog posts from Google Cloud, talking about the real-life use cases for GenAI, I think you highlighted what\nwas a pretty material increase in a number of companies that are starting to turn their, I guess, ideas into products. I think it was like an 80% increase in the\n6-month period. And I think you guys also published some survey data saying that your customers are generating tangible ROI there. So can you update us on\nwhat you're seeing in terms of sales cycles, perhaps accelerating? And how much of the heavy lifting the cloud team may have to do to help your customers turn\nthose ideas into reality more quickly? And Philipp, I think one of the feedbacks that we're getting from advertisers is that while the initial use case for PMax for\nthem was in search, they're starting to use it more and more for mid and upper funnel campaigns and budgets as well. So can you talk about whether that's an\nanecdote or something that you're already seeing perpetuate among all of your advertisers? Thank you.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:14:36Z"}
