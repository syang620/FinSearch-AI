The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or a change in or failure of one or more of the Company\u2019s logistics, supply or manufacturing partners. Varied stakeholder expectations about social and other issues expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business. Various stakeholders, including governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and others, have differing expectations about a wide range of social and other issues related to the Company\u2019s business. The Company makes statements about its values, including the environmental and societal impact of its business, through various non-financial reports, information provided on the Company\u2019s website, and in press statements and other communications. The Company also pursues environmental and other goals and initiatives that involve risks and uncertainties, require investments, and depend in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company\u2019s control, and there can be no assurance that the Company will fully achieve all of its goals and initiatives. Efforts by the Company to advance its business and values, or achieve its goals and further its initiatives, or to align with stakeholders\u2019 expectations, or comply with evolving, varied and at times conflicting federal, state and international laws, regulations and standards, or any failure or perceived failure to do so, can result in adverse reactions by consumers and other stakeholders, including the commencement of legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company, and can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.
