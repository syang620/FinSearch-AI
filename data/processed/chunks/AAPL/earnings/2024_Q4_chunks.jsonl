I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks. Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $94.9 billion, a September quarter record \nand up 6% from a year ago. iPhone grew in every geographic segment, marking a new September quarter revenue record for the category, and Services set an \nall-time revenue record, up 12% year-over-year. We also set September quarter segment revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and the Rest of Asia Pacific, \nas well as in a large number of countries, including the United States, Brazil, Mexico, France, the UK, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. And \nwe continue to be excited by the enthusiasm we're seeing in India, where we set an all-time revenue record. This has been an extraordinary year of innovation at \nApple. We brought the revolutionary Apple Vision Pro to customers in February, which brings users tomorrow's technology today. And in June, we announced incredibly useful and relevant. Apple Intelligence marks the beginning of a new chapter for Apple innovation and redefines privacy and AI by extending our \ngroundbreaking approach to privacy into the cloud with Private Cloud Compute. Earlier this week, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in \nUS English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users, with systemwide Writing Tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural and conversational Siri, a more \nintelligent Photos app, including the ability to create movies simply by typing a description, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification \nsummaries and priority messages. And we look forward to additional intelligence features in December, with even more powerful Writing Tools, a new visual \nintelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence, and ChatGPT integration, as well as localized English in several countries, including the UK, Australia, \nand Canada. These features have already been provided to developers and we're getting great feedback. More features will be rolling out in the coming months, \nas well as support for more languages, and this is just the beginning. Now, I'll turn to our results for the quarter, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenues set a \nSeptember quarter record of $46.2 billion, up 6% from a year ago, with growth in every geographic segment.

Now, I'll turn to our results for the quarter, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenues set a \nSeptember quarter record of $46.2 billion, up 6% from a year ago, with growth in every geographic segment. With the introduction of Apple Intelligence, we're \nbeginning a new era for iPhone. iPhone 16, powered by A18, is equipped with an incredible new 48-megapixel Fusion camera, fantastic photo experiences, and \nthe addition of the action button and camera control. An iPhone 16 Pro is the most advanced iPhone we've ever made, powered by A18 Pro and featuring even \nlarger displays, an industry-leading pro camera system with camera control, and studio quality mics, all with a huge leap in battery life. Turning to Mac, revenue \nwas $7.7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Just this week, we brought a new generation of Apple Silicon to Mac, M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. From blazing fast \nperformance to Apple's most advanced neural engine yet, our latest chips can easily tackle incredibly complex workflows, and they ensure our newest Macs will \nbe the best personal computers for AI the instant they hit stores. With the newest additions to our Mac lineup, customers can choose the Mac that's just right for \nthem, whether that's iMac, the world's best and most beautiful all-in-one; MacBook Air, the world's most popular laptop now with double the starting memory; \nMacBook Pro, the best Pro notebook anywhere; or the incredible, mighty new Mac mini, our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac. iPad revenue was $7 billion, 8% higher \nyear-over-year. iPad is unlike any other product on the market today, and it's become an essential device in homes, schools, and businesses of all sizes. \nRecently, we were thrilled to introduce the newest iPad mini, featuring an ultra-compact design built for Apple Intelligence with support for Apple Pencil Pro. It's \nbeen a big year for iPad. iPad Air was popular with students and teachers as they got back to school this year, while creators are pushing the boundaries of \nwhat's possible with the M4-powered iPad Pro. In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $9 billion, down 3% from a year ago. During the quarter, we \nlaunched the all-new Apple Watch Series 10, bringing a beautiful new design and new capabilities to the world's most popular watch that make it even more \npowerful, intelligent, and sophisticated. It's the thinnest Apple Watch yet, making it more comfortable than ever, while offering the biggest, most advanced display. \nwatchOS 11 brings some huge new health and fitness insights to users, including sleep apnea notifications, which help to alert people with a potentially serious \nbut often undiagnosed condition. We're proud of the impact we make through our health innovations on watch, and I'm grateful for every note I receive about the \nimportance of watch in people's lives. With AirPods 4, we broke a new ground in comfort and design with our best-ever open-ear headphones available for the \nfirst time with active noise cancellation. And we were especially pleased to unveil revolutionary end-to-end hearing health capabilities for AirPods Pro 2 with \nhearing protection, hearing test, and hearing aid features. These just became available in a software update this week, and we believe this will make a meaningful \ndifference in our users' lives.

And Apple Vision Pro continues to deliver \nspatial experiences that weren't possible before, including immersive entertainment like the new short film, Submerged, which gives people a view into the unique \nstorytelling power made possible by spatial computing. Vision Pro has more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million compatible apps for visionOS 2, as well \nas applications companies are building to reimagine how they work. Vision Pro continues to inspire awe in its users, and we're just scratching the surface of \nwhat's possible. And just yesterday, we announced we're bringing Vision Pro to Korea and the UAE. As I mentioned earlier, Services achieved an all-time \nrevenue record of $25 billion, up 12% from a year ago, and with all-time revenue records across most of our categories. With Apple TV+, we love celebrating the \ncraft of great storytellers who know how to put on a show. Audiences love to discover new movies like Wolfs, explore acclaimed new series like Disclaimer, and \ndive back into returning favorites like Slow Horses and Shrinking. Apple TV+ productions have become fixtures at award shows, earning more than 2,300 \nnominations and more than 500 wins today. Apple also offers a live sports experience in a league of its own with MLS Season Pass, and subscribers have been \ncheering on their favorite teams in the MLS Cup playoffs. This month, we also marked 10 years of Apple Pay. There's always something magical about being able \nto buy groceries or pay for movie tickets seamlessly with your Apple device. Today, users choose Apple Pay for purchases across tens of millions of retailers \nworldwide. And we're excited to make the Apple Pay experience even better, with the option to redeem rewards and access loans from credit cards, debit cards, \nand other lenders right at checkout.

In honor of World Teachers' Day, Apple was proud to share new resources for teachers to engage their students\nin ways that aim to make learning easy and fun. Additionally, we've expanded our education grant program into 100 new schools and communities, helping with\neverything from access to technology, to educator resources, to scholarships and financial support. As we near the end of the year, we're proud of the progress\nwe've made in our efforts to be carbon-neutral across our entire footprint by the end of the decade.

Before I hand it over to Luca, with Luca\ntransitioning to a new role with Apple, this will be the final time he's joining our call. So, I just wanted to take a moment to recognize his extraordinary service as\nApple's CFO and to thank him for his partnership. I am deeply grateful. In his 10 years in the role, Luca has done truly exceptional work in shaping Apple as we\nknow it today. He has helped manage Apple for the long term, thoughtfully and deliberately. He has helped us enrich the lives of so many around the world, and\nhe has been a leader that people look up to and have learned so much from. I have incredible confidence in our incoming CFO, Kevan Parekh, and we look\nforward to more of you meeting and working with him going forward. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you, Tim, for the very kind words.

Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the midpoint of the\nguidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and up 6% year-over-year. During the quarter, we recorded a one-time income tax charge of $10.2\nbillion, which relates to the impact of the reversal of the European General Court's State Aid decision. When we exclude this one-time charge, net income was\n$25 billion and diluted earnings per share were a $1.64, up 12% year-over-year, and a September quarter record. Operating cash flow was very strong at $26.8\nbillion, a new September quarter record. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46.2 billion, up 6%\nyear-over-year, and a September quarter record in total and across several markets, including the US, the Middle East, Korea, and South Asia. The iPhone active\ninstalled base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the September quarter, many iPhone models were among the\ntop-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top-selling model in the US, Urban China, the UK, Australia,\nand Japan. We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction for the iPhone 15 family, with 451 Research recently measuring it at 98% in the US. Mac\nrevenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the strength in MacBook Air. Customers have been loving the performance of Apple Silicon on Mac and\nwe are very excited to bring the latest M4 family of chips to the lineup. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high with about half of customers in the quarter\nbeing new to Mac. And in the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 95% in the US. iPad generated $7 billion in revenue, up 8%\nyear-over-year. In addition to growth in developed markets, we also saw strong performance in many emerging markets, with double-digit growth in Mexico,\nBrazil, the Middle East, India and South Asia. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased iPads during\nthe quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97% in the US. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9\nbillion, down 3% year-over-year. The Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the\nquarter being new to the product.

And\nas always, we remain focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services from new games on Apple Arcade to new features like Tap to Cash and pay\nwith installments using Apple Pay to many successful new and returning shows on Apple TV+. This past quarter, we celebrated the five-year anniversary of Apple\nCard, which was ranked #1 in customer satisfaction among co-branded credit cards by J.D. Power for the fourth year in a row.

And Novartis, a leading global pharmaceutical company, recently chose iPhone 16 as the\nstandard mobile device for all employees. We also see continued momentum with Apple Vision Pro in the enterprise space. UC San Diego Health is the first\nhospital in the world to test spatial computing apps on Apple Vision Pro in clinical trials for patient surgery in the operating room. Let me now turn to our cash\nposition and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $157 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $2.6 billion in maturing debt and\nincreased commercial paper by $7 billion, leaving us with total debt of $107 billion. As a result, net cash was $50 billion at the end of the quarter. During the\nquarter, we returned over $29 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25 billion through open market repurchases of 112\nmillion Apple shares. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that\nSuhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are\nprojecting today for the current quarter. We expect our December quarter total company revenue to grow low- to mid-single digits year-over-year. We expect\nServices revenue to grow double-digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the fiscal year 2024. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We\nexpect OpEx to be between $15.3 billion and $15.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $250 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to\nmarket of minority investments. And our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of\ncommon stock payable on November 14, 2024 to shareholders of record as of November 11, 2024. With that, let us open the call to questions. Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions.

Thanks. Thanks, Michael. As I noted in my comments, just this week on Monday, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in US English for iPhone,\niPad, and Mac. This includes things like systemwide Writing Tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural conversational Siri, more intelligent Photos\napp, including the ability to create movies, simply by typing a description, which is really cool, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification\nsummaries and priority messages. There's also email summaries and email priority. We're getting a lot of positive feedback from developers and customers. And\nin fact, if you just look at the first three days, which is all we have obviously from Monday, the 18.1 adoption is twice as fast as the 17.1 adoption was in the\nyear-ago quarter. And so, there's definitely interest out there for Apple Intelligence. Carrying on in the quarter, we are looking forward to bringing even more\nfeatures in December, and this will include even more powerful Writing Tools and visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence, and ChatGPT\nintegration in addition to other features, as well as we'll bring localized English to several countries that include the UK, Australia, and Canada. So, it's going to be\nquite a software quarter between the release on Monday and the release in December. And then, as we turn the corner to '25, we'll have more languages rolling\nout, starting in April as well and more features as well. And so, it's a very strong drumbeat, and we couldn't be more excited about it.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:13:04Z"}

A question that I think will overlap with your new role as well. Could you just talk a little bit about the CapEx outlook and whether\ninvestments in things like Private Cloud Compute could change the historical CapEx range of roughly $10 billion a year? Thank you very much. Thank you, Michael. On the CapEx front, I've mentioned before a number of times, we have a bit of a hybrid model in the way we run our data centers. In some\ncases, we use our own data centers. In some cases, we use, third-party providers. So, our CapEx numbers may not be fully comparable with others.

You will see in our 10-K the amount of CapEx that we've incurred during the course of fiscal '24, and we will -- in fiscal '25, we will continue to make all\nthe investments that are necessary, and of course, the investments in AI-related CapEx will be made.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:13:04Z"}

Thanks so much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Tim, maybe if we start with you, I think each of the last four years you've exited the December\nquarter with iPhone demand outpacing supply. As we look to this quarter in the iPhone 16 cycle, lead times are relatively short. There are no known supply\nshortages. And I'm just curious whether you've been able to maybe get a better read on early cycle iPhone demand this year relative to past years. And if so,\nwhat you've learned about upgrade rates, switching rates, trade-ups versus trading down and being more price sensitive? And overall, any impact that Apple\nIntelligence may have on iPhone 16 sales? And then, I have a follow-up. Thank you. There's a lot there. On Apple Intelligence, we believe it's a compelling upgrade reason. And we'll -- but we just launched it three days ago and so what we've got\nnow from a data point point of view is the number I just referenced that 18.1 has twice the adoption rate of 17.1. So, that clearly shows a level of interest out\nthere. In terms of exiting the December quarter with demand greater than supply, that's not my recollection that, that happened for all four of the years. We clearly\nhad cases during COVID where there were disruptions and that's the some spilled over, but in a more regular environment where we're not having something, a\n100-year flood kind of thing, we would -- our desire is to get into balance as quickly as possible. We don't want customers having to wait for products. And so, if\nyou look at how we've done this year, we did that very quickly on the 16, on the 16 Pro family, the Pro and the Pro Max, we've been constrained in October, but\nwe believe that soon we'll be out of constraint. And so, that's a good sign from our point of view. Keep in mind that, that's a function of supply and demand, not\none side or the other. And we've been preparing for the quarter for a while. So that's what I would say there.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:13:04Z"}

Historically, you do guide gross margins up 50 basis\npoints sequentially, which you just told us about for the December quarter. So, can you maybe just help us understand your view of component prices and broadly\nwhether you still see those as tailwinds to gross margins and how sustainable that tailwind might be, or whether that should become a headwind as we look\nforward? Thanks so much. Yes, Erik. As you know, our gross margins are a factor of many, many variables. Commodities, of course, are important. They're not the only factor. But\nspecifically on commodities, I can tell you that both for the September quarter and what we expect for the December quarter, most commodities are going to\nmove down in price, while NAND and DRAM increased during the course of the September quarter and we expect them to increase during the December quarter.\nWe are very pleased with the level of gross margins that we've reported during the course of the year.

As\nyou look at the Services portfolio today, can you just talk about how much of this business do you think is reoccurring versus transactional? And are the growth\nrates different between the subscription portfolio over here versus transactional portfolio? Yes, Amit, I'll take this one. Yes, we are, first of all, very, very happy with -- it's an important milestone. Of course, we've got to a run rate of $100 billion. You look\nback just a few years ago, and the growth has been phenomenal. We're very pleased. We've got a very diversified portfolio of services. And over the years, the\namount that is recurring in nature has grown and is growing faster than the transactional piece. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions on our platform right\nnow between our own services and third-party services. That continues to grow strong double-digits. So, we feel very, very good.

Hi, thanks for taking my question. And again, thanks Luca for all your help with analyts and investors. My first question is on R&D. Given how much your\ntech peers are spending on AI, does this new era of Apple Intelligence actually require Apple to invest more in R&D beyond your current 7% to 8% of sales to\ncapture this opportunity? And then, I had a follow-up. Krish, as you know, we've been investing heavily in R&D over the last several years. Our R&D growth has been significant during the last several years. And\nobviously, as we move through the course of fiscal '24, we've also reallocated some of the existing resources to this new technology to AI. And so, the level of\nintensity that we're putting into AI has increased a lot, and you maybe don't see the full extent of it because we've also had some internal reallocation of the base\nof engineering resources that we have within the company.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:13:04Z"}

I understand Apple Intelligence is a feature on the phone today, but do you think that, in the\nfuture, it could potentially have or benefit the services growth business, or is that too -- are these too bifurcated to even make a call on the [indiscernible]? Thank\nyou. I think, just to keep it in mind, Apple Intelligence is also available on the Mac for the M-series products and on certain models of iPad, and in addition to the\nphone.

And what I'm really curious about if you have any thoughts given that Apple Intelligence is now going to be a consistent\nfeature set across all the four sort of iPhones on the iPhone 16 series that you launched and going back to iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. Are you seeing any\nchange in behavior from a consumer perspective in terms of which sort of on the mix front within the iPhone series where consumer adoption is given that there's\nmore consistency of the features when it comes to Apple Intelligence across the board? And I have a follow-up. Thank you. It's tough to answer your question, because we've been constrained in October on the Pro and the Pro Max. And so, it's really too early in the curve to call the\nprecise mix on the consumer versus the Pro. So, we'll see.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:13:04Z"}
