Cook\nThank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, we are proud to report a June quarter revenue record of $94 billion, up \n10% from a year ago, which was better than we expected. EPS set a June quarter record of $1.57, up 12% year-over-year. We saw an acceleration of growth \naround the world in the vast majority of markets we track, including Greater China and many emerging markets. And we had June quarter revenue records in \nmore than two dozen countries and regions, including the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, India and South Asia. These results \nwere driven by double-digit growth across iPhone, Mac and Services. We set a June quarter record for iPhone, which grew a strong 13% year-over-year. We saw \niPhone growth in every geographic segment and double-digit growth in emerging markets, including India, the Middle East, South Asia and Brazil. Mac continued \nto see excellent results with revenue up 15% year-over-year. And we set another all-time revenue record in Services, which grew 13% with double-digit growth in \nboth developed and emerging markets. Last month, we hosted WWDC, an incredible event for our developer community with millions joining us online and more \nthan 1,000 developers here in person at Apple Park. We shared some truly exciting updates, including a stunning new design crafted from a material we call experience it this fall. And we were excited to share some updates across our AI work. We announced even more capabilities coming later this year, including live \ntranslation and Workout Buddy. In addition to those new features, we announced new support for a number of languages, and we opened up access to the \non-device foundation models at the core of Apple Intelligence, enabling developers to build a whole new experience for our users. It's wonderful to see great \nmomentum building for our platforms. iOS 26, macOS 26 and iPadOS 26 are by far the most popular developer betas we've had.

Taking a step back, we see AI \nas one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. We are embedding it across our devices and platforms and across the company. We are also \nsignificantly growing our investments. Apple has always been about taking the most advanced technologies and making them easy to use and accessible for \neveryone. And that's at the heart of our AI strategy. With Apple Intelligence, we're integrating AI features across our platforms in a way that is deeply personal, \nprivate and seamless, right where users need them. We've already released more than 20 Apple Intelligence features, including visual intelligence, cleanup and \npowerful writing tools. We're making good progress on a more personalized Siri, and as we've said before, we expect to release these features next year. Apple \nsilicon is at the heart of all of these experiences, enabling powerful Apple Intelligence features to run directly on device. For more advanced tasks, our servers \nalso powered by Apple silicon deliver even greater capabilities while preserving user privacy through our private cloud compute architecture. We believe our \nplatforms offer the best way for users to experience the full potential of generative AI. Thanks to the exceptional performance of our systems, our users are able \nto run generative AI models right on their Mac, iPad and iPhone. We're excited about the work we're doing in this space, and it's incredibly rewarding to see the \nstrong momentum building. Now let me turn to more details about our results for the quarter, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $44.6 billion, up 13% from \na year ago, and we set a June quarter record for upgraders. This strong broad-based performance was driven by the incredible popularity of the iPhone 16 family, \nwhich was up strong double digits year-over-year as compared to the 15 family. We also recently marked a significant milestone. We shipped the 3 billionth \niPhone since its launch in 2007. From the Pro models with the powerhouse A18 Pro and innovative Pro camera features to the iPhone 16e with breakthrough \nbattery life and a 2-in-1 camera system, users are finding so many reasons to love the best iPhone lineup we've ever created. And iOS 26 will take that \nexperience even further. In addition to the beautiful new design and powerful Apple Intelligence features, it introduces a range of meaningful updates like \nreal-time call screening and hold assist in the phone app, smarter messaging tools and new live translation features. It all adds up to a smarter, more personal \niPhone experience that we can't wait for users everywhere to enjoy this fall. In Mac, we had another strong quarter with revenue of $8 billion, up 15% \nyear-over-year, largely driven by the strength of the M4 MacBook Air. We set a June quarter record for upgraders on Mac, and we saw great performance in \nemerging markets with strong double-digit growth on revenue as well as strong double-digit growth on both upgraders and customers new to Mac. MacBook Air, \nthe world's most popular laptop, unlocks a whole new level of performance with the power of M4. MacBook Pro customers meanwhile continue to be drawn to its \nincredible power and the longest battery life we've ever had on a Mac. Customers are also loving the newest Mac Studio, which is the most powerful Mac we've \never made with next-level capabilities to tackle even the most demanding AI workflows. At the same time, Mac mini continues to win over customers by packing \nso much performance into an ultracompact design.

It starts with a new windowing system that's remarkably intuitive, giving users more control than \never of their iPad experience. An enhanced files app makes it easier than ever to stay organized. And that's all on top of a beautiful new software design that \nbrings these updates to life. Turning to Wearables, Home and Accessories. Revenue was $7.4 billion, and we saw a June quarter record for upgraders to Apple \nWatch. During the quarter, we marked the 10-year anniversary of Apple Watch, celebrating a decade of helping users navigate their health and fitness journeys. \nAnd with watchOS 26 Apple Watch will be more intelligent than ever with smart updates to the workout app and Smart Stack, along with a fresh new design that \nfeels both dynamic and personal. We're also thrilled about what's coming to Apple Vision Pro with visionOS 26 introducing spatial widgets that let users customize \ntheir digital space, more life-like personas and new enterprise APIs that empower companies to build their own spatial experiences. And this fall, new features for \nour latest AirPods lineup will unlock even more possibilities from studio quality audio recording to using AirPods as a camera remote, giving users powerful new \nways to capture content and stay connected. As we're innovating across our lineup, we're especially proud of the work we're doing to help our users live healthier \nlives.

Turning to Services. Revenue for the June quarter was $27.4 billion, up 13%\nfrom a year ago and an all-time record. Apple TV+ scored 81 nominations, a record for the platform across nearly every eligible category for this year's Emmy\nAwards. Severance leads all Emmy nominees with 27 nominations and The Studio follows close behind with 23 nominations, more than any other freshman\ncomedy series ever. It's amazing to see how these and other Apple TV shows have captured the popular imagination. To date, Apple TV+ has earned more than\n2,700 award nominations and 585 wins on the strength of the highest-rated original content of any streaming network. And we continue to see very positive trends\nin the June quarter with TV+ viewership up strong double digits year-over-year. In June, we were also thrilled to release F1 in theaters around the world, one of\nthe summer's most unforgettable blockbusters. During the quarter, we celebrated a big anniversary with 10 years of Apple Music. To mark the occasion, we\nlaunched an all-new studio space in Los Angeles for artists to create content and connect with fans. And later this year, we're bringing Apple Music users even\nmore to love from an enhanced listening experience with AutoMix, which mixes songs like a DJ to lyrics translation and more. The App Store meanwhile\ncontinues to be the very best place to discover the latest apps from developers around the world in a safe and trusted way and App Store revenue grew double\ndigits year-over-year, setting a June quarter record. In retail, we continue to find opportunities in emerging markets to connect with even more customers. We\nrecently launched the Apple Store online in Saudi Arabia, and we couldn't be more excited to open new stores in the UAE and India later this year. We were also\ndelighted to welcome customers in Japan to a new location in the heart of Osaka. Across everything we do at Apple, we show up by leading with our values. We\nfeel strongly that the benefits of technology should be shared by everyone. That's why we make technology for everyone. In May, to mark Global Accessibility accessibility reader, a new system-wide reading mode to make it easier to understand content. And we're proud to introduce accessibility nutrition labels, giving\nusers an understanding of accessibility features before they download an app while helping developers educate people on features their app support. This month,\nwe also announced a $0.5 billion commitment with MP Materials to strengthen the supply of vital recycled rare earth materials in the U.S. and support American\nindustry. And in August, we're opening our all-new Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit to train and support American manufacturers. These investments are\npart of Apple's largest ever spend commitment, which we announced earlier this year. Over the next 4 years, Apple is investing $500 billion in the U.S., driving\ninnovation and creating jobs in cutting-edge fields like advanced manufacturing, silicon engineering and artificial intelligence. We're proud of this work and all that\nwe're doing to tap into American innovation and bring the best technology experiences to users across the globe. And we continue to look for further opportunities\nto do even more. Finally, the situation around tariffs is evolving, so let me provide some color there. For the June quarter, we incurred approximately $800 million\nof tariff-related costs. For the September quarter, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter\nand no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add about $1.1 billion to our costs.

With that, I'll turn it over to Kevan. Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our revenue of $94 billion was up 10% year-over-year and is a new June quarter record. We grew in every \ngeographic segment and in the vast majority of the markets we track. Products revenue was $66.6 billion, up 8% year-over-year, driven by growth across iPhone \nand Mac. And thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our installed base of active devices reached another all-time high across all \nproduct categories and geographic segments. Services revenue was $27.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year and an all-time record. We saw strength across the \nworld with double-digit growth in the majority of our markets. Company gross margin was 46.5% at the high end of our guidance range and down 60 basis points \nsequentially, primarily driven by approximately $800 million in tariff-related costs Tim mentioned earlier. Products gross margin was 34.5%, down 140 basis points \nsequentially, driven by mix and tariff-related costs, partly offset by cost savings. Services gross margin was 75.6%, down 10 basis points sequentially. Operating \nexpenses landed at $15.5 billion, up 8% year- over-year. This strong business performance led to June quarter records for both net income at $23.4 billion and \ndiluted earnings per share of $1.57, which was up 12% year-over-year. Operating cash flow was also strong at $27.9 billion. Now I'm going to provide some more \ndetails for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $44.6 billion, up 13% year-over- year, driven by the iPhone 16 family. As Tim noted, we saw \niPhone growth in every geographic segment and double-digit growth in many emerging markets. The iPhone active installed base grew to an all-time high in total \nand in every geographic segment, and we reached a June quarter record for upgraders. According to a recent survey from Worldpanel, formerly of Kantar, iPhone \nwas a top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, the U.K., Australia and Japan during the June quarter. And we continue to see very high levels of customer \nsatisfaction in the U.S. at 98% as measured by 451 Research. Mac revenue was $8 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by continued strength across the \nportfolio, including MacBook Air, Mac mini and MacBook Pro. We grew in every geographic segment and saw double-digit growth in Europe, Greater China and \nthe rest of Asia Pacific. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high, and we hit a June quarter record for upgraders.

And based on the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 98% in the U.S. Wearables, \nHome and Accessories revenue was $7.4 billion, down 9% year-over-year.

We continue to improve the quality and breadth of our Service offerings from the new Apple Games app to a \ncontinued expansion of Tap to Pay and Wallet. Turning to enterprise. Organizations are continuing to invest in Apple products to drive employee innovation and \nproductivity. With companies like PayPal and Roche deploying more Macs for their workforce, we had the best June quarter ever for Mac in enterprise.

CAE, a leader in pilot training and simulation technology is using Apple Vision Pro to enable \npilots to become more familiar with aircraft procedures, leading to more productive in-person flight simulator training outcomes. Let's turn to our cash position and \ncapital return program. We ended the quarter with $133 billion in cash and marketable securities. We had $5.7 billion of debt maturities, issued $4.5 billion of new \ndebt and increased commercial paper by $4 billion, resulting in $102 billion in total debt. Therefore, at the end of the quarter, net cash was $31 billion. During the \nquarter, we returned over $27 billion to shareholders.

Maybe Tim, just on the supply chain strategy. I know last quarter, you talked about focusing production or assembly to India.\nAnd I just want to get an update on how you're thinking about the strategy holistically, given sort of the tariff rates, I think, in India potentially are higher than I think\nanyone had expected. So I know you mentioned some U.S. investments, would love to kind of get your thoughts on how you're thinking about China versus the\nrest of Southeast Asia and India going forward? And then I'll give you my second question also. So Kevan, I'm just trying to understand a little bit more about the\ndemand drivers of iPhone in the quarter because obviously, the 16 has been in the market for some time. I know there was some promotional activity. But\nseasonally, you generally don't see this kind of strength in the June quarter. Maybe you can help us understand outside of maybe the promotional activity, what\nelse were some of the drivers that led to what was -- looks like a pretty significant above seasonal strength in the June quarter stats?\nTimothy D. Cook\nYes. In terms of the tariff situation and country of origin and so forth. One thing I would say, just to remind everyone is keep in mind that the vast majority of our\nproducts are covered under the Section 232 investigation. And so the -- today or I should say, last quarter, the bulk of the tariffs that we paid were the IEEPA\ntariffs that hit early in the year related to China. And so that's just a reminder of where things are and what we assumed as we calculated the projection of $1.1\nbillion that's in our outlook color. In terms of the country of origin, it's the same as I referenced last quarter. There hasn't been a change to that, which is the vast\nmajority of the iPhone sold in the U.S. or the majority, I should say, have a country of origin of India and the vast majority of the products, other products, the Mac\nand the iPad and the Watch have a country of origin of Vietnam that are sold in the United States. Still, the products for other international countries, the vast\nmajority of them are coming from China. And so that hopefully gives you a flavor of the of where things are. But I would stress again that we do a lot in this\ncountry in the United States. And we've committed $500 billion, and we're always looking to do more. And you could kind of see that in the most recent\nannouncements, whether it's MP Materials or our manufacturing academy that we're standing up in Detroit in a couple of weeks or so. And so we're going to be\ndoing -- we're doing more in this country, and that's on top of having roughly 19 billion chips coming out of the U.S. now, and we will do more, and of course,\nglass from iPhone and the Face ID module. And so there's loads of different things that are done in the United States.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:13:05Z"}
