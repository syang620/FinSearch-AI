I wanted to ask, Jensen, about the deployment of Blackwell versus Hopper just between the systems nature and all the demand for GB that you\nhave. How does the deployment of this stuff differ from Hopper? I guess I ask because liquid cooling at scale hasn't been done before, and there's some\nengineering challenges both at the node level and within the data center. So do these complexities sort of elongate the transition? And how do you sort of think\nabout how that's all going? Thanks.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:18:28Z"}

Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, in the past, you've made the observation that general-purpose computing ecosystems typically dominated each\ncomputing era. And I believe the argument was that they could adapt to different workloads, get higher utilization, drive cost of compute cycle down. And this is a\nmotivation for why you were driving to a general-purpose GPU CUDA ecosystem for accelerated computing. And if I mischaracterized that observation, please do\nlet me know. So the question is, given that the workloads that are driving demand for your solutions are being driven by neural network training and inferencing,\nwhich on the surface seem like a limited number of workloads, then it might also seem to lend themselves to custom solutions. And so then the question is about\ndoes the general purpose computing framework become more at risk or is there enough variability or a rapid enough evolution on these workloads that support\nthat historical general purpose framework?
