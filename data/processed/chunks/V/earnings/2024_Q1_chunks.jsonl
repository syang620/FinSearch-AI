I just wanted to ask a question around the new partnerships within value-added services. Ryan, it sounds like, as part of the priorities, you want to get\nvalue-added services on all the networks. And I think you were alluding to the fact that this is going to be maybe a bigger shared responsibility with this\npartnership growth, and ServiceNow is obviously a great example. But I'm just trying to reconcile kind of how we should be thinking about Visa maybe opening up\nthose opportunities with these two partnerships and what that may do at some point to the financial picture of the company? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney\nYes. Again, if I back up before I answer to the specific question about ServiceNow and partners, we're very excited about the progress that we've made on our\nvalue-added services strategy. We're excited about the momentum that we're seeing kind of in the market. We're excited to see our sales efforts really driving\nsuccess and performance across issuing, acceptance, risk and identity, advisory and open banking. And it's exactly as you were saying with partners like\nServiceNow. What we're finding is we can have great efforts selling to our partners directly around the world. But we're also getting a lot of demand from various\ndifferent platforms that already have relationship with thousands or tens of thousands or, in some cases, more customers in any one country or region. And\nthey're very excited to sell through our value-added services as a way of differentiating their platform and deepening relationships with their users and their\ncustomers. And so in the example of ServiceNow, they had been talking to their bank clients, and their bank clients had asked for and been interested in some of\nthe dispute services that we provide. And so we're going to market first, as I said in my prepared remarks, with our dispute services via ServiceNow. We've got a\npipeline of other products and services that we're working with them on. And we're deep in discussions with other platforms around the world about bringing our\nmoney movement solutions and our value-added services solutions as a way to differentiate their platform and add value to their users. Yes, will do. So yes, on Reg II, so as we indicated, we did see some modest impact in the U.S. Payment volumes growth in the U.S. was down about 80 basis\npoints from Q4 to Q1. And that slowdown was primarily due to a couple of things. One is the mix of spend days, but also there were a few smaller things, a softer\nOctober and the modest impact from Reg II that we're talking about. So a couple of things. It's important to note, we've actually not seen any meaningful changes\nto volumes being routed away since October. So all in all, the impact is modest, really hasn't changed over the past quarter, and that's actually what we have\nassumed and we shared for the rest of the year. Now to your second part of your question about one-time items, I talked a little bit about the things in the U.S.,\nReg II and the slow October. The other place where I talked about onetime items was in the new flows business. As I said, the revenue growth was impacted by a\ncouple of things. One, I talked about the cross-border normalization as on travel. And then secondly, there were these one-time items, and I'll give you an\nexample of one. In the normal course of our business, we regularly true up or true down our incentive and rebates with our clients based on their reported metrics.\nAnd in the first quarter, the net impact of these adjustments ended up being larger than we might typically see in a quarter. But all in all, it's not something that\ngives us concern. The underlying business fundamentals remain healthy.

I want to follow-up on services.

As I was saying earlier, I think the strategy is really firing on all cylinders. Our execution is firing on all cylinders. The client demand remains\nstrong. The TAMs are large, as you were saying. Last year, we generated about $7 billion in revenue in the value-added services business. I think we said in the\nquarter, it was a little more than $2 billion and up 20% in constant dollars. Those are great results. To get in a little bit into the details of your question, I mean, we\nrun these businesses segment by segment. In issuing solutions, we're having great success with our network products around the world. DPS continues to have\ngreat success with clients in the U.S. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had renewed with Bank of America. That's one of our, as you might expect,\nlargest clients in DPS, a fantastic partner, as well as a number of the other value-added services I mentioned. In the acceptance solutions business, CyberSource\ncontinues to have great success around the world, both with their omnichannel services as well as some of the value-added services they have, like token\nmanagement service and the like. Our disputes business beyond just what I mentioned earlier around ServiceNow is having great success.

Just wanted to get a couple of clarifications. I think last quarter, Chris, you talked about growth would be at a low point in the first quarter, and then you\nwould see that trough accelerate going forward. Just a nuance of the guide is mid to high single digits, so just trying to make sure if there was anything else new\nto report on Q2 versus Q1 being the trough. And then secondly, just a slightly higher operating expense in constant currency from, I think, it was high single to low\ndouble, just the low double now. Was there anything to factor in for that? Yes. Thanks, Bryan. Yes, so just backing up to your point, going into Q1, you outlined the guidance that I gave. We set an expectation at that time, similar\nlanguage, high to mid-single digits to high -- sorry, mid- to high single digits, and we did come in at the high end of that range, which was, again, largely benefiting\nfrom timing of incentive performance. We have a similar expectation in terms of the range of growth in Q2, but many of the variables that I talked about in terms of\nthe half one versus half two a quarter ago, which was lapping high volatility, lapping high cross-border performance from a year ago and lapping lower incentive\ngrowth from a year ago, those, we continue to believe, hold true. And we do anticipate that growth will accelerate into the second half of the year. In terms of your\nquestion on OpEx, yes, the changes that you picked up in terms of the full year guide primarily have to do with two things. One is we're now including the impact\nof the acquisition of Pismo into the guide for OpEx, and there's been some slight updates based on FX, the current FX rates.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:46Z"}

I wanted to touch on the cross-border travel volume growth. It looks like it slowed from roughly 25% to maybe 16% to 17% in January. And back when\nyou're kind of outlining your assumptions for fiscal '24, you thought it would be in the low-20%, and we see a 4 to 5 percentage point improvement compared to\n2019. Just wondering how we should think about that as an assumption going forward. Do you think we'll bounce back to that low 20s? Or do you think something\ncloser to where you've seen in January makes more sense? Now this is an area that sometimes you have at least some forward visibility, so trying to get a sense\nof where we should be thinking about that component? Yes. Great. Thanks, James. We had a really good quarter in Q1 to start the year on our cross-border business. Cross-border volumes, as you said, was up 16%.\nWe feel great about that; and as you click into those, e-com growth in the low teens and 19% growth in travel, with the index going from 139% to 142%. And I'll\njust clarify one thing you said in terms of the guidance that we had provided into the low 20s, that was related to the travel portion of that, which came in at 19% or\nalmost 20%. I do think when understanding the composition by region of our performance, and some of this is a little repetitious but I think important to go\nthrough, looking at it region by region is helpful. In LAC, CEMEA, Europe and U.S. outbound, strong results, indexing between 145% to 170% relative to the 2019\nlevels; second, U.S. inbound, which up until Q4 had lagged 2019, also continued to improve in Q1 and in line with our expectations; in AP, we did see continued\nexpansion in and out of AP but a little bit slower than we saw in Q4, and that was specific to Australia and Japan. And it's probably also worth mentioning, well,\nnot necessarily a large number, the war in the Middle East did have some impact on the cross-border numbers as well. But again, stepping back, we feel really\ngood about our cross-border business in total. The Q1 results were strong, 16% growth; healthy growth for both travel and e-com.

Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to dig into Pismo a little bit. The website talks about large banks, marketplaces and fintechs. And you mentioned\nearlier the movement away from the legacy systems into more modern cores. I want to talk a little bit about the ambitions and the potential in terms of the bank\nsizing. And also, these core conversions, are they for new product and sort of sidecar cores, if you will? Or are we talking about the potential for your core kind of\nissuing clients in the U.S., midsized banks, to be moving their legacy core potentially over to something offered by Pismo in the future?\nRyan McInerney\nSo let me step back and talk a bit about how we found Pismo and then answer your question directly, Timothy. I mentioned in my prepared remarks these \nnarratives and these priorities that we've been hearing from CEOs of banks all over the world, in the U.S. and all over the world, medium-sized, big-sized banks,\n\nwhich is, one, they're trying to make this transition from their legacy tech stacks to the cloud; and the second is they want to expand, especially in emerging\nmarkets where they don't have enough options of issuer processors to help them. That led us, hearing that over and over and over again, to go search the world\nfor what we thought was the best cloud-based processor and core bank provider that we could find. And that led us to Pismo. And so while Pismo is based down\nin Brazil, their platform is global. Their clients today are a mix of some of the biggest and most sophisticated banks in the world as well as medium-sized banks\nand fintechs. So they already today have a mix of different client types. And our ambitions, our ambitions are what I said in my prepared remarks, which is we\nwant this to be the preferred provider of banks around the world. You asked specifically about midsized banks in the U.S. for their core banking platform, the short\nanswer is absolutely. As you think about large banks and their issuer processing capabilities not just for debit, which we have today in the U.S., but for debit,\ncredit, prepaid, commercial, not just in the U.S. but globally, we think Pismo is absolutely a solution that our issuers could be using around the world.
