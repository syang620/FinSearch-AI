You highlighted there have\nbeen a little bit of slowing growth there, maybe domestically, but overall still remained good and maybe impacted by FX, et cetera, but we've seen a lot of FX\nmoves. So just wondering how you're feeling about the travel outlook on a go-forward basis and anything you can glean from early bookings, et cetera? Thanks.\nRyan McInerney\nHi, James. Yeah. We covered a number of moving parts in our travel and cross-border business as it impacted Q2 and gave some assumptions about what we\nanticipated going into the back-half of the year. I think I'll make two points. One is, obviously, the situation is quite fluid, and we're monitoring the data very closely,\nand we're really relying on facts and facts and the results as we see them. But the second point maybe is even more important is that when we look across our\nbusiness, we talk about the diversity of our business across -- in many dimensions. Regional is one of them. But certainly, when we look at our cross-border\nbusiness, whether that's issued or acquired, we also benefit from that diversity. And when it comes to inbound travel into the US, the US specifically actually is\none of the smaller regions as measured by cross-border inbound travel volume, even though it does have strong yields. And so we just keep that in mind. We'll\nhave to watch how the data comes in, but we have great diversification in our cross-border business, and we anticipate that we'll be able to navigate this period. Next question.\nOperator\nNext, we'll go to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:46Z"}

I appreciate you taking the question. Chris, I was wondering if you could double-click again on some of the comments you shared around the\nincentives outlook. I think you've been talking about a pretty front-loaded renewal schedule. I thought -- I heard, but correct me if I'm wrong, the outlook is for\nmodest increases in the growth rate over the next two quarters, but I may have misheard that. But if that was the case, could you just talk through cadence and\nsome of the drivers, kind of help square that with the front-loaded renewals? Appreciate it. Thank you. Sure, Will. Thanks for the question. You did hear correctly, and let me try to add a little bit of color and clarify. Q2 incentives grew 15%, came in lower than we\nhad anticipated, primarily due to factors related to deal timing. I covered that on the call. In terms of what we expect for the full year and into the second half of the\nyear, we've updated the expectation that in the back half of the year, our growth will be slightly higher than originally expected due to two factors that we called\nout. One is client-related performance adjustments, and the second is deal timing, which means specifically anticipated early renewals. And so when we\nreforecast the second-half of the year, we do expect the second-half to grow higher than the first-half of the year, and we do expect that sequentially to be Q3 a\nlittle higher than Q2, and Q4 to be a little higher than Q3. And then maybe the final thing I'll say is, when we look at the volume -- payment volume that was\nimpacted by renewals, we still believe that we have the same expectation that we started the year, which is 20% of the payment volumes being impacted.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:46Z"}

Thank you. Chris, I want to dig in a little bit more on the delta between nominal cross-border volumes and nominal international revenue. I think you did a\ngreat job going through the items. But to recap, there's the FX volatility. There's the quarter and client mix, there is a pricing aspect. And then, of course, there's\nthe hedging, which impacts the revenue, but not the volumes. I think you touched on the FX volatility, meaning not assuming in the guide that the high levels will\npersist, which is a good conservative approach. You talked around quarter mix and the yields being higher for US inbound. The one I was hoping you could drill in\na little bit more is pricing, because I know previously the guidance talked a little bit about pricing being a second-half of the fiscal year event. So, whether it'd be\nspecific to cross-border or for the whole business, maybe you could just touch a little bit on that pricing topic. Sure. Hi, Tim. Yes, let me parse those apart a little bit. You covered my points on international transaction revenue. As you pointed out, we grew 10%, which was \nin line with the nominal volume growth, but below the 13% constant-currency, that's the impact of FX. And I covered a number of items that impacted that, in\n\naddition to FX, higher volatility, and some offsets there that you mentioned. Happy to give you more color on those. But let me hit to your second point, which is\nour expectations on the full-year on pricing. Just to remind everyone, at the start of the year, we said we would anticipate that the pricing contribution to growth in\nthe full year would be similar to the previous year, but the timing would be a little bit different, where we'd have more back-end loaded pricing. That's still our\nexpectation. We don't have a different view. We do believe that pricing will benefit in the second half more than it did in the first half of this year.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:46Z"}

It's -- the overall environment, I'll go back to some of the comments Ryan made, the overall comment, the overall environment\nremains stable, healthy, and steady. Whenever we give the month-to-date data, I always disclaim it by saying two or three weeks, or three weeks in this case,\ndon't make a trend. We'll have to see how the rest of the quarter plays out.

One is, trends sort of triangulating around the data. The most important thing I think to keep in mind is that when we see --\nwhen we talked about discretionary versus non-discretionary, they were both quite strong and healthy relative to the previous quarter. And so within that, we did\nhave some puts and takes. I mentioned some travel and entertainment, but also offset by retail goods, as an example. And so there are puts and takes, there are\nsome moving parts within that, but overall, healthy stable volumes, whether it's discretionary or non-discretionary.

My extrapolation of your guidance is, if there's a little bit of weakness, kind of just more related to cyclicality as opposed to\nanything more crazy, you guys can absorb that, correct me if I'm wrong on that assumption.

Thanks.\nRyan McInerney\nYes. Hi, Adam. I touched on some of these points a little bit ago, but let me just expand on them because I think it's sort of an interesting way to think about it.\nObviously, every recession is different. But over the course of time and over history, Visa has proven to be quite resilient even during these economic downturns.\nWe don't know what's going to happen. We're not economic forecasters. But the management team here is ready to move decisively should the need arise. Now\nour business is resilient. I talked about the diversification of the business, more exposure to everyday spend, more exposure to debit, even our cross-border\nvolume is more e-commerce today than travel than it was, if I think about pre-COVID levels. And so that diversification helps us. And so if there was a downturn, I\nthink our performance during this potential economic slowdown we would be resilient, and it can impact our business. If you think about it, between volumes and\nrevenue, volumes historically grown faster than PC. Even if PC slows, we're confident that we can continue to grow faster than that for all the reasons I spoke\nabout. And then the one other thing I'd add is on the revenue front, remember that incentives are largely variable. And so to the extent that volume growth does\nget impacted, there could be an offset on incentives. On the expense side, I think we've also historically shown we could flex our expenses. We could make -- we\nobviously want to balance between short and near-term and long-term priorities. We don't want to overreact to anything. We want to be thoughtful about making\nsure that we're investing in the right areas to ensure that Visa is successful over the long term, but we do have levers, and this is a management team that stands\nready to act. Next question.\n\nOperator\nNext, we'll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRamsey El-Assal\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. Stablecoin seem to be having their moment, maybe helped along by clear regulations. I know you called out your strategy\nthere, including this -- reaching $200 million of settlement flows.

Thanks.\nRyan McInerney\nIt's still early, but we do see real potential, which is why we've been investing in the crypto space broadly in the stablecoin space specifically for many years now.\nWe've built up a team of real experts that I think are very well-respected among the ecosystem. But it's early. On the one hand, $200 million is a great kind of\nmilestone. On the other hand, it's still a relatively very small portion of our overall settlement volume. I guess I'd say a couple of things. One is, we are optimistic\nabout the kind of the US government passing more clear and pragmatic regulations.

As long as we are permitted to operate in a country or territory, even if\nit's been more difficult for us to operate there than it has historically, we have a proven track record of being successful.
