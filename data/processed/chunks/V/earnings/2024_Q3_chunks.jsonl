And with that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\nRyan McInerney\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We delivered strong third quarter results with $8.9 billion in net revenue, up 10% year-over-year, and EPS up \n12%. Our key business drivers were relatively stable as compared to Q2, adjusted for leap year. In constant dollars, overall payments volume grew 7% \nyear-over-year, U.S. payments volume grew 5%, and international payments volume grew 10%. Cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe, rose 14%, and \nprocessed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. We recently received the results from our annual Global Client Engagement Survey where Visa achieved a processors and across our regions, the results remain strong, with a notable 6-point NPS improvement in North America. I want to thank all of our 30,000 \nemployees who helped deliver these fantastic results. And as I review some highlights from the quarter, you'll see how this focus on serving our clients by \nmeeting their needs, innovating, and helping them grow is fueling our success across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Let's start with \nconsumer payments, where we see more than $20 trillion of opportunity to capture cash, check, ACH, domestic schemes and other forms of electronic payment. \nIn our client engagement survey, our clients ranked our strategic partnership and our brand as two of the most important factors to our successful relationships. I'll \nshare some examples of how each of these played out this quarter. In strategic partnerships, we are constantly seeking ways to add more value and grow \ntogether with our clients. We are pleased to have been named the Preferred Network Partner by Lloyds Banking Group, renewing our debit relationship and \nsignificantly expanding our relationship in credit, winning 10 million additional credit credentials across the Group's consumer and commercial business. Also in \nthe U.K., NatWest has launched a new Visa Travel Reward credit card, following the signing of our partnership last year. They will also be utilizing many \nvalue-added services, including transaction controls and card benefits. On the European continent, we worked with Raiffeisen Bank International AG, a leading \nbank in several markets. And recently, in the Czech Republic and Romania, we renewed our commercial business and expanded our consumer debit and credit \nbusiness totaling over two million potential new credentials. In Korea, we deepened our partnership with leading issuer KB Kookmin Card. Already a user of Visa \nDirect cross-border money movement and a Visa consumer and commercial issuer, they will grow their consumer credit and debit portfolios with Visa and use \nvalue-added services, including consulting", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:47Z"}

Already a user of Visa \nDirect cross-border money movement and a Visa consumer and commercial issuer, they will grow their consumer credit and debit portfolios with Visa and use \nvalue-added services, including consulting and marketing services. In Peru, we extended our partnership with leading issuer, Banco de Credito de Peru, across \nconsumer and commercial portfolios with plans to launch additional new flows offerings and value-added services. In the U.S., we extended our agreement with \nWells Fargo. This will allow us to continue to support Wells Fargo's strategy to reinvent their credit business and provide additional growth by leveraging key Visa \nassets like consulting and Visa sponsorships such as FIFA and the Olympic and Paralympic Games. On the brand front, with the Olympic Games opening \nceremony later this week, it is exciting to see the engagement with the Visa brand and activation across the world in marketing campaigns, cardholder \nexperiences and Olympic and Paralympic-branded Visa issuance, which I am happy to report in Europe is at nearly six million cards compared to the five million \nnumber I quoted just last quarter. We have also added nearly 100,000 new merchant locations in France in advance of the event. Our brand also plays an \nimportant role in winning co-brand partnerships. In India, growing credit issuance and reaching affluent and cross-border consumers remain areas of focus. We \nare excited about the launch of a co-brand card with Adani One and ICICI Bank as India's first co-branded credit card with rich airport-linked benefits for their \ntarget base of 400 million customers through the Adani One platform. We also signed an agreement to launch a new co-brand card with Tata Digital, along with \nan Indian banking partner, building on the success of our existing credit co-brand relationship. This new co-brand offering consists of a multicurrency prepaid \nforeign exchange card that will target travelers from India, also benefiting from the rewards of the Tata Digital Super App, Tata Neu. Across seven countries in using CyberSource. And in CEMEA, we reached a de novo co-brand arrangement with BinDawood, a leading grocer in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with 88 \noutlets and over five million loyalty program members. On the travel side, we extended our relationship with Malaysia Airlines from a prepaid co-brand card \ntargeting millennials and Gen Z customers to also launch a new co-brand credit card for the travel-minded affluent. And in the U.S., Turkish Airlines have chosen \nVisa to be their exclusive network partner for their new Miles and Smiles co-brand credit card. Our consumer payment strategy is focused on growing credentials \nas we are doing across all the partnerships I just mentioned and increasing acceptance locations. And wallets are a great example of where this comes together, \nwhere Visa can be a funding source, an embedded credential, and an accepted form of payment by wallet merchants. This increases the value proposition for \nwallet providers and their users. Two wallet highlights this quarter are in Peru and Vietnam. Yape is a Peruvian super app with more than 15 million users who \nalready have a Visa credential that enables them to send money across P2P apps via Visa Direct. And just recently, they launched Tap to Phone functionality for \ntheir more than two million merchants to accept Visa. And in Vietnam, a country with approximately 50 million wallet users, the three leading digital wallets, \nMoMo, VNPAY, and ZaloPay are now enabling their users to utilize Visa cards as a funding source for transactions at over 500", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:47Z"}

One additional area that we are very focused on is delivering simple, easy, and secure checkout experiences. Let me share a few \nrecent examples. First, we are integrating Click to Pay and the Visa Payment Passkey Service, enabling a customer to authenticate themselves using biometrics. \nAlready, we have hundreds of issuers enabled for passkeys in Europe and a number of issuers who represent more than 50% of our e-commerce payments \nvolume in Europe piloting the solution. Second, we crossed 10 billion tokens this quarter, a significant milestone. And in 2023 alone, Visa tokens helped generate \nmore than an estimated $40 billion in incremental e-commerce revenue for businesses globally and saved more than $600 million in fraud.

With tapping as one of the best in-person commerce experiences, we want to provide Visa users with more ways to\ntap, including Tap to Pay, tap to authenticate an identity, tap to add a card, or tap to send money to family or friends. And finally, this quarter, Tap to Pay grew\nfour percentage points from last year to 80% of face-to-face transactions globally, excluding the U.S. In the U.S., we surpassed 50% and have 30 U.S. cities\nabove 60% penetration. Now moving on to new flows. This quarter, new flows revenue grew 18% year-over-year in constant dollars with Visa Direct overall\ntransactions growing 41% for the quarter to 2.6 billion and commercial volumes up 7% year-over-year in constant dollars. Let me provide some updates, starting\nwith B2B, where we have focused on penetrating new verticals and delivering innovative products and solutions. In healthcare, we will work with AXA and\nPaysure to launch a commercial virtual card solution to simplify the claims processes for their customers worldwide. We have also expanded our virtual card\nacceptance with a key business services provider, Cintas, who offers uniform, safety, and fire protection services to over one million customers. Together with our\npartner, Billtrust, we will help Cintas streamline their payments, automate processes, and manage costs on Billtrust's Business Payments Network or BPN. We\nalso just recently extended our long-standing BPN collaboration with Billtrust that connects suppliers and buyers to facilitate straight-through processing of virtual\ncard payments with rich data that optimizes acceptance costs. Our products and solutions in B2B remain very important in winning and growing our business.\nOne such solution is the enhanced B2B data that we can provide. In Brazil, together with Solero, a leading business financial management solution, we will\nprovide issuers with enhanced visibility into small business spend by aggregating data across cards, bank accounts, boletos and more, enabling them to better\nmanage their client relationships and offer compelling products. Another solution is Spend Clarity, which provides expense program management, including card\nissuance, controls, and reporting. Wells Fargo has white-labeled our solution called Wells One Expense Manager, which has now onboarded 6,000 corporate\nclients representing over one million users, providing access to their spend data. Now moving on to Visa Direct. We continued to grow our transactions through\nexpanded and new relationships. Over the past year, total Visa Direct cross-border P2P transactions have nearly doubled, with Europe and CEMEA being the\nlargest regions. In CEMEA, we are very excited to have renewed our Visa Direct relationship with fintech Monobank in addition to renewing their consumer and\ncommercial credit, debit, and prepaid portfolios. In Asia Pacific, we are partnering with China Zhongsheng Bank on cross-border capabilities, including Visa Direct\nand Currencycloud, allowing the bank to support cross-border payments for their merchant clients. Canadian fintech Nuvei has extended its agreement with us for\nVisa Direct across all cross-border use cases in more than 30 countries for their merchant clients and recently became the first Visa Direct enabler in Colombia.\nWe also executed our first global agreement with WorldRemit and Sendwave, enabling their customers to eventually send Visa Direct cross-border remittances\nfrom 50 countries to recipients in 130 countries. Quickly, a leading South Asian marketplace, has enabled Visa Direct cross-border remittance solutions for U.S.\ncustomers to send money to relatives and friends in India and the rest of South Asia. And in earned wage access, we reached an agreement with Weaver, a\nU.K.-based embedded finance provider.

And in earned wage access, we reached an agreement with Weaver, a\nU.K.-based embedded finance provider. In addition to card issuance, they will be utilizing Visa Direct to enable Weaver's business clients to offer employee\nexpense reimbursement, reward and recognition, and earned wage access. Earned wage access provider PayActiv, who serves 4,000 businesses has renewed\nits agreement with us and will enable Visa+ for payouts. Similarly, we expanded our relationship with enabler, Astra. In addition to domestic disbursements, Astra\nwill now offer cross-border remittances, implement Visa+ to reach domestic wallets in the U.S., and expand to additional use cases, including payroll, earned\nwage access and marketplaces. Visa+ is still in the early stages but is fully rolled out and live for PayPal and Venmo users and more providers continue to join\nthe platform. Wrapping up new flows, we also renewed an agreement with FIS, an important issuer processing partner to enable a suite of value-added services\nand new flows capabilities for their clients, including Visa Direct. And now on to value-added services, where revenue was up 23% in the third quarter in constant\ndollars. Let me highlight some of the progress we have made in driving adoption and growth among our value-added services portfolio. First in issuing solutions.\nOne area of strong revenue growth this quarter was in card benefits, where we enable our clients to offer unique value propositions tailored to their customer\nbase in travel, entertainment, restaurants, insurance and more. Strong issuance in premium cards across most of our regions has fueled this growth in the third\nquarter. For example, in Latin America, travel benefits have grown with over 370,000 unique visits to our Visa Infinite Airport Lounge in Brazil, representing\ncustomers from a number of leading issuers. In addition, since its launch in 2022, our Visa Infinite Fast Pass in Brazil, which allows cardholders to get through\nairport security more quickly, has screened over one million travelers. These are among the top five card benefits in Brazil and deliver value to customers, issuers\nand Visa. We continue to add more benefits like the recently launched partnership with OpenTable to offer eligible Visa cardholders access to coveted restaurant\nreservations and experiences in the U.S., with plans to expand into Canada and Mexico. In Acceptance Solutions, third quarter growth was driven by increasing\nutilization across both token and e-commerce-related services. In e-commerce, one such example is with iFood, the largest food delivery platform in Brazil who is\nutilizing our Verifi solution to help prevent disputes before they become chargebacks. In addition, they will be using our authentication solutions. In Risk & Identity\nSolutions, we continued to see strong adoption by new and existing clients, driven in part by growth in card-not-present transactions. In North America, acquirer\nWorldpay will be expanding their use of our authentication solutions from CardinalCommerce, fostering collaboration and real-time enhanced data exchange\nbetween Worldpay merchants and issuers during card-not-present transactions, reducing fraud and allowing more transactions to be properly authenticated and\nauthorized securely. We are also pleased that the pilot of our account-to-account risk scoring solution Visa Protect with Pay.UK has had great results, showing an\naverage 40% uplift in fraud detection over the 3-month pilot period. In addition, we are now launching Visa Protect in Argentina with a core payments technology\ncompany, Celsa after successfully piloting the solution there as well.

The last two value-added services are open banking and advisory services. We continue to\nsign new partners with Tink in Europe and the U.S. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong growth in client demand for our consulting and\nmarketing services, particularly around marquee events such as the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Our value-added services portfolio solutions is strong and is\ndriving meaningful growth for our clients and for Visa. Before I close, I wanted to speak to the fact that the settlement reached for the injunctive relief class was\nrejected by the court. We are, of course, disappointed with this decision. We believe that the prior settlement provided meaningful relief to all merchants and we\nwill continue to work towards another settlement. To close, so far this fiscal year, we have seen strong revenue and EPS growth as a result of relatively stable\nvolume and transaction growth. I remain very excited about the opportunity that lies ahead of us. At Visa, we come to work in service of our clients and partners\nand are focused on building and deploying the best solutions possible across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services. Now over to Chris. Thanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. In Q3, we had another strong quarter with relatively stable growth across payments volume, cross-border volume, and \nprocessed transactions when compared to Q2, adjusted for leap year. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 7% year-over-year and cross-border \nvolumes, excluding intra-Europe, was up 14% year-over-year. Processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. Fiscal third quarter net revenue was up 10% in \nboth GAAP and constant dollars, in line with our expectations. EPS was up 12% year-over-year and 13% in constant dollars. Now let's go into the details. In the \nU.S., payment volumes growth numbers were generally in line with Q2 adjusted for leap year, with total Q3 payments volume growing 5% year-over-year, with \ncredit and debit also growing 5%. Card-present volume grew 2% and card-not-present volume grew 7%. In the U.S., while growth in the high spend consumer \nsegment remained stable compared to prior quarters, we saw a slight moderation in the lower spend consumer segment. Moving to international markets. Total \npayments volume was up 10% in constant dollars, relatively stable with Q2 when adjusted for leap year. Payments volume growth rates were strong for the \nquarter in most major regions, with Latin America, CEMEA, and Europe ex U.K. each growing more than 16% in constant dollars. Asia Pacific payments volume \nslowed to less than 0.5 point of year-over-year growth in constant dollars for the quarter, driven primarily by the macroeconomic environment, most notably in \nMainland China. Now to cross-border volume, which I will speak to today in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume \nwas up 14% in Q3, relatively stable to Q2 adjusted for leap year.

Cross-border travel volume growth was also up in the mid-teens or 157% indexed to\n2019. This quarter, we saw the inbound Asia Pacific Index improve nine points at a similar pace to Q2 to 151% of 2019. The improvement in Asia Pacific\noutbound travel, however, slowed from Q2 with the index increasing by less than one point to 125% of 2019. We continue to see the same primary drivers as last\nquarter with some additional pressure from macroeconomic conditions. Now let's review our third quarter financial results. I'll start with the revenue components.\nService revenue grew 8% year-over-year versus the 8% growth in Q2 constant dollar payments volume, with revenue yield improving sequentially and versus last\nyear due to improving utilization of card benefit. Data processing revenue grew 9% versus 10% processed transaction growth with the revenue yield generally in\nline sequentially and versus last year. International transaction revenue was up 9% versus the 14% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding\nintra-Europe, impacted by lapping higher currency volatility from last year. Volatility levels remain consistent on average to last quarter. Other revenue grew 31%,\nprimarily driven by strong consulting and marketing services revenue related to the Olympics and, to a lesser extent, pricing. Client incentives grew 11%. Now on\nto our three growth engines. Consumer payments growth was driven by relatively stable payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transaction\ngrowth. New flows revenue grew 18% year-over-year in constant dollars. Visa Direct transactions grew 41% year-over-year, helped by growth in Latin America for\ninteroperability among P2P apps. Commercial volumes rose 7% year-over-year in constant dollars. In Q3, value-added services revenue grew 23% in constant\ndollars to $2.2 billion, primarily driven by Issuing and Acceptance Solutions and Advisory Services. Operating expenses grew 14%, primarily due to increases in\ngeneral and administrative personnel and marketing expenses, including spend related to the Olympics. FX was 0.5 point drag versus the 1.5 point benefit we\nexpected. Pismo represented an approximately one point drag. Nonoperating income was $73 million. Our tax rate was 18.8% and EPS was $2.42, up 12% over\nlast year, inclusive of an approximately 1.5 point drag from exchange rates and an approximately 0.5 point drag from Pismo. In Q3, we bought back\napproximately $4.8 billion in stock and distributed over $1 billion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of June, we had $18.9 billion remaining in our\nbuyback authorization. Now let's move to what we've seen so far in July through the 21st with volume growth in constant dollars. Cross-border is excluding\nintra-Europe. U.S. payments volume was up 4% with debit up 4% and credit up 3% year-over-year. The slight deceleration from Q3 does not appear to be from\nany one factor but likely a number of smaller factors such as weather, timing of promotional shopping events, and the technology outage, among others.\nCross-border volume grew 13% year-over-year, below Q3 levels with travel-related volume growing slightly less, which continued to be impacted by Asia Pacific\nand card-not-present ex travel volume growing at similar levels to Q3.

You can review these disclosures in our earnings\npresentation for more detail. Let's start with the fourth quarter. We expect payments volume and processed transactions to grow at a similar rate to Q3. For total\ncross-border volume growth, we are expecting to end up slightly below Q3. Currency volatility continues to average around 4-year lows through July 21. And as\nsuch, we are making an adjustment to currency volatility expectations for Q4, now assuming volatility will stay in line with Q3 levels. Incentives are expected to be\nat their lowest growth rate all year. Pulling it all together, we expect adjusted net revenue growth in the low double digits, which equates to a slight improvement\nfrom the 10% adjusted revenue growth rate in the third quarter. We expect our Q4 adjusted operating expenses to grow in the high single digits. Nonoperating\nincome is expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. The tax rate is expected to be between 19% and 19.5% in Q4, which puts Q4 adjusted EPS growth\nrate in the high end of low double digits. Moving to the full year. With three quarters now complete, our expectations for full year adjusted net revenue growth\nremains unchanged from what we shared at the start of the year. Whilst absorbing the impact of lower currency volatility and the macroeconomic challenges in\nAsia, which have affected volumes, we still expect to reach low double-digit adjusted net revenue growth for the full year. Full year adjusted operating expense\ngrowth will be in the high single digit to low double digits, reflecting the less favorable impact of FX. This keeps full year adjusted EPS growth in the low teens. In\nclosing, we delivered strong results this quarter, with new flows and value added services revenue growing faster than consumer payments.

Can you just talk a little bit about how\nmuch of that is volume-driven, versus the amount of renewals you're seeing? And just trying to think about, as we head into next fiscal year, just what kind of\ngrowth or sustainable growth should we think about for incentives? Thanks. Thanks for the question. I'll even take us back a little bit about the expectations that, we had for incentives coming into the fiscal year. As we ended fiscal '23, that\nwas a high year for us in terms of volume of renewals, a little higher than our typical sort of normal cadence. That did impact how we thought about the incentive\nvolumes in FY '24. And even last year, we had sort of a different growth rate in the first half and the second half of the year. And so as we looked across this year,\nwe had a slightly lower volume of renewals this year. Obviously, year-to-date incentives have played out slightly differently, largely due to client performance, deal\ntiming, things like that. And overall, it's been better than, as it's been lower, I guess, than what we anticipated. When we go into Q4, sort of the same trend\napplies. We still expect Q4 to benefit from the lapping of the high incentives that, we saw in the second half of last year, which informs, again, the growth rate that\nwe anticipate in Q4.

Thanks.\nRyan McInerney\nHi, Will. Thanks for the question. And you're asking about the MDL litigation. I guess I'll just back up. The first thing I would say is we strongly disagree with the\njudge's decision. We believe the settlement was fair. We believe the settlement provided meaningful relief to all merchants. The second thing, I would say is the\ndecision failed to take into consideration a number of things, especially the complex multisided ecosystem that we operate in. The role that - the complicated role\nthat many different players in the ecosystem delivered. So, but having said that, we're pursuing a revised settlement. It's too early to speculate on what that\nsettlement is. So I just - I won't do that today.

Thanks for taking the question. I want to hit on that at the same time tackles, both incentives and value-added services revenue. So it's the concept of value\nin-kind incentives. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about whether or not, these are becoming more prominent, meaning you're using them a little bit more in\ndiscussions with issuers. And then, if you could just briefly recap some of the mechanics around the revenue recognition, the contra revenue, the addition to\ndeferred revenue. And then eventually, the value-added services revenue? Thanks a lot.\nRyan McInerney\nYes. I'll just give you the high level on this. The value in-kind is a great way for us to, as it says, to deliver value to our clients. And increasingly, our clients, as you\nsee in our performance are preferring to buy our value-added services, versus just take incentives that might drop to the bottom line. So that is absolutely\nsomething that, our clients are asking for more of. It's something that is helping our clients grow their businesses. And I talked earlier about just the last several\nyears about our product pipeline, how we've gone to market, how we built new products to solutions and services for our clients. And that's what's driving the\ndemand. So that's kind of become a more important part of our client renewals and our client renewal discussions. And increasingly value-added services are\nbecoming a way for us to differentiate ourselves with our clients, and grow our consumer payments business. Do you want to talk about the organics? Tim, to the second part of your question, maybe I'll just give you a high-level summary. I think you have sort of the pieces you called out. At a high level, when\nvalue in-kind is offered in lieu of a cash incentive, it can - it would be recognized as a contra revenue at the time that it's granted or earned, depending on the\nnature of the contract. And then on the other side, when the client is able to utilize that value in-kind for services from Visa, commonly in our value-added services\nbusiness, that's then recognized as revenue and the associated costs are also recognized in our P&L.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:47Z"}

Like Chris said, we're three weeks into the quarter. We had a hurricane. We had a\ntech outage across the country. We had a number of things happen. So, we're not kind of taking three weeks as a trend. We'll see kind of how things progress\nfrom here, in just terms kind of what happens for the rest of the quarter. I don't know if you want to talk about the credit-debit divergence. Yes. Well, I think I'll refer back to a little bit of a comment that we made, and we're seeing the July results. I also commented on the call that we are seeing a little\nbit of moderation in what I would call the lower spend band cohorts. And I think that's a little bit correlated, to some of the volume numbers that we're seeing in the\nquarter, related to credit versus debit.

Thank you. Wanted to ask on new flows here. So you had a nice acceleration in growth really over the last two quarters on consistent comps.\nCan you add more color on the particular areas of strength that have picked up? I know Visa Direct was one of those. I'm just curious if you think you could\nsustain that level of expansion, or may that moderate a bit? Yes. Thanks for the question. 18% growth, as I mentioned, feel really good about the execution and the momentum in the business. It is an enormous opportunity\nthat we have in front of us, across both our commercial business and money movement with Visa Direct. I think you're familiar with the numbers, 41% growth in\nthe transactions and stable commercial volumes as well. I think what - this acceleration that you're referring to, we had a unique situation in Q1 where we had\nsome onetime items that really kind of depressed the growth, reported growth in Q1. And if you look at the last couple of quarters, it's more reflective, I think, of\nthe underlying health in the business. That said, as we saw in Q1, that growth rate can vary from quarter-to-quarter, based on deal timing and terms and one-time\nitems like the one that impacted Q1. And so overall, I'd say at the macro level, good momentum. The underlying business is healthy, and we're continuing to see\nthat level of growth. And the growth rate should be healthier, and should continue to grow faster than consumer payments, with some normal expected variability\nquarter-to-quarter.\nRyan McInerney\nAnd just to build on Chris' points, I think we're in the very early stages of Visa Direct growth. We spent many, many years investing and building the platform, the\ninfrastructure, the connectivity, domestic cross-border, working with issuers and acquirers and processors. And now we're able to be out there selling all around\nthe world, finding new use cases, some of which I highlighted in my prepared remarks. You go back to 2019, we did 2 billion Visa Direct transactions. We did 2.6\nbillion transactions this quarter. So this is just another great example of, when we go and we systematically identify the need in the market, we spend the time, we\nbuild the infrastructure. We build 8.5 billion end points, the connectivity, the reliability, the security, the fraud capabilities. I just think we're in the very early stages\nof what we're going to see, in terms of the growth of this business and the number of use cases and partners, many of which I highlighted in my prepared remarks\nthat, are going to want to build their use cases on this platform.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:47Z"}

So just a clarification on revenue, and then a question on volumes for this fiscal year. So it sounds like for Q4, you're looking for revenue growth of,\ncall it, 11% to 12%. I think that would put you at the low end of the low double-digit guide, you're maintaining for the year. So that's what I wanted to clarify. And\nthen just a question on volumes. I think you said Q4 should be in line with Q3, which I think would bring the full year to around 7%, versus the high single-digit\nupdated guide last quarter. So just as we start to tune our models for next year, what are some of the potential accelerants off that 7% level we should be\nconsidering? Hi, Jason, let's unpack that. You had a couple of things in there, and I just want to - I think this is important, so we'll just be super clear. For Q4, my guidance, our\nguidance for our Q4 adjusted net revenue would be low double-digits. And sort of the directional guidance I also gave is it would be slightly above the Q3 level\nthat we reported, which was the 10% growth in the quarter. And so sort of take that - take those two points and I would triangulate around that. And that would still\nget you sort of to the math of the low end of low double-digits, as you called it, for the full year. The second point was on drivers from Q3 to Q4. I did say that\npayment volume, payment transactions, we anticipate Q4 to be consistent with Q3. The one exception to that is in cross-border, where I did say it'd be slightly\nbelow the Q3 levels. And that really is based on the travel circumstances and situation in Asia that we've talked about extensively, with outbound travel in Asia, in\nparticular, being impacted and recovering slower than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. And so, those are the two variables in terms of the - to get the\nQ4 guidance consistent with the intent - that I communicated. And then as far as FY '25 goes, we're at the beginning end of planning, and as we always do, we'll\nshare our expectations on '25 at the end of Q4.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:47Z"}

I guess more of a big picture question here, Ryan. So your AI and gen AI investment, you've talked about, I think at conferences, your desire to kind of\nbuild out your own large language model.

Hi, Dan, thanks for the question on AI. First of all, to frame it is, we are all in on gen AI at Visa as we've been all in on predictive AI, for more than a decade.\nWe're applying it in two broad-based different ways. One is, sort of adopting across the company to drive productivity, and we're seeing real results there. We're\nseeing great results, great adoption, great productivity increases from technology, to accounting to sales all across the company. The second is applying\ngenerative AI to enhance the entire payment ecosystem. And to the latter part of your question, absolutely. I guess I'd give you one set of examples or some of\nthe risk tools and capabilities that we've been deploying in the market. I mentioned the risk products that we're using on RTP and account-to-account payments.\nThat is an opportunity to reduce fraud, both for merchants and for issuers. I think I mentioned on a previous call, we have our Visa Provisioning Intelligence\nService, which is using artificial intelligence to help predict token provisioning fraud before it happens. That also is a benefit to both issuers and merchants. And\nthe list goes on. So, we are very optimistic about the positive impact that generative AI can have, not just on our own productivity, but on our ability to help drive\nincreased sales and lower fraud across the ecosystem.

It was a little hard for us to hear you, Harshita, but I think I got the gist of your question around the growth algorithm for consumer payments, especially in\nmature markets. So as I've said before, we see more than $20 trillion of opportunity around the world. About a quarter of that is in the U.S., by the way. And that's\ncash, that's check, that's ACH, that's electronic transactions, that's cards that run on domestic networks and the like. And we're capturing that opportunity through\na few different ways. One is continuing to expand acceptance and expand the places, where people can use cards.
