This quarter, the firm reported net income of $15 billion, EPS of $5.24 on revenue of $45.7 billion, with an\nROTCE of 21%. These results included an income tax benefit of $774 million, which we described in more detail in the earnings press release. On the next page,\nwe have some more detail. The firm reported revenue of $45.7 billion, down $5.3 billion, or 10% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was down $185 million, or 1%,\ndriven by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression, predominantly offset by higher wholesale deposits, higher revolving balances in Card, as\nwell as the impact of securities activity, including from prior quarters. NIR ex Markets was down $6.3 billion, or 31%, and excluding the net gain related to Visa\nshares and net investment securities losses in the prior year was up $1 billion, or 8%, driven by higher Asset Management fees, higher auto lease income, higher\nInvestment Banking fees and higher Payments fees. And Markets revenue was up $1.1 billion or 15%. Expenses of $23.8 billion were up $66 million, and\nexcluding last year's Visa stock contribution to the firm's Foundation was up $1.1 billion, or 5%, primarily driven by compensation, higher brokerage and\ndistribution fees as well as higher auto lease depreciation. And credit costs were $2.8 billion, with net charge-offs of $2.4 billion, and a net reserve build of $439\nmillion. The build was driven by new lending activity, largely offset by a decrease in the probabilities that we attached to the adverse scenarios and the allowance\nestimation. On to the balance sheet on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, down 40 basis points versus the prior quarter as net income was\nmore than offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter's higher RWA is primarily driven by an increase in wholesale lending across both CIB\nmarkets and banking, an increase in other markets activity as well as an increase in Card loans. As you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago.\nUnder the current rules, our indicative SCB is floored at 2.5% and goes into effect in 4Q '25. Our new SCB also reflects the Board's intention to increase the\ndividend to $1.50 per share in the third quarter. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB. CCB reported net income of $5.2 billion on revenue of $18.8\nbillion, which was up 6% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management revenue was up 3%, largely driven by growth in Wealth Management revenue with\ndeposit NII relatively flat. Average deposits were down 1% year-on-year and flat sequentially. Client investment assets were up 14% year-on-year, driven by\nmarket performance and continued healthy flows into managed products. In Home Lending revenue was down 5% year-on-year, predominantly driven by lower\nNII. Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 15% year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances, as well as higher\noperating lease income in Auto. Card outstandings were up 9% due to strong new card acquisition. In Auto originations were up 5%, driven by higher lease\nvolumes. Expenses of $9.9 billion were up 5% year-on-year largely driven by growth in technology and auto lease depreciation. Credit costs were $2.1 billion,\nreflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion, relatively flat year-on-year, in line with expectations. Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank.

CIB reported net income\nof $6.7 billion, on revenue of $19.5 billion, which was up 9% year-on-year. IB fees were up 7% year-on-year. We continue to rank #1 with wallet share of 8.9%. In\nadvisory fees were up 8%, benefiting from increased sponsor activity. Debt underwriting fees were up 12%, primarily driven by a few large deals. In equity\nunderwriting fees were down 6% year-on-year. Our pipeline remains robust, and the outlook along with the market tone and sentiment is notably more upbeat.\nPayments revenue was up 3% year-on-year, excluding equity investments driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, predominantly offset by deposit\nmargin compression. Lending revenue was down 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher losses on hedges. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was up 15%\nyear-on-year. Fixed income was up 14% with improved performance in Currencies & Emerging Markets, Rates and Commodities. This was partially offset by\nfewer opportunities in Securitized Products and Fixed Income Financing. Equities was up 15%. We continue to see strong performance across products, most\nnotably in derivatives. Security Services revenue was up 12% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth. Expenses of $9.6 billion were up\n5% year-on-year, driven by higher compensation, brokerage and technology expense, partially offset by lower legal expense. Average Banking & Payments loans\nwere down 2% year-on-year and up 2% quarter-on-quarter with sequential growth, primarily driven by new loans with larger corporates. Average client deposits\nwere up 16% year-on-year and up 5% sequentially, reflecting increased activity across Payments and Security Services. Finally, Credit costs were $696 million,\ndriven by builds in our C&I portfolio, including new lending activity and downgrades to a handful of names, partially offset by the scenario probability adjustment, I\nmentioned upfront. Turning to Asset & Wealth Management to complete our lines of business. AWM reported net income of $1.5 billion with a pretax margin of\n34%. Revenue of $5.8 billion was up 10% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, as well as\nhigher brokerage activity and higher deposit balances. Expenses of $3.7 billion were up 5% year-on-year driven by higher compensation, including\nrevenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $31\nbillion for the quarter led by fixed income and equities. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $5 billion. AUM of $4.3 trillion was up 18% year-on-year, and client assets\nof $6.4 trillion were up 19% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 7% year-on-year and 3%\nquarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. Turning to Corporate.

Expenses of $547 million were down $32 million year-on-year, excluding the\nFoundation contribution in the prior year that I mentioned earlier. To finish up, I'll touch on the outlook. You'll recall that at Investor Day, I made a couple of\ncomments previewing the potential evolution of the outlook. So now let me formalize that and give you updated guidance. First, we now expect NII ex Markets to\nbe approximately $92 billion, with the increase driven by changes in the forward curve and strong deposit growth in Payments, Security Services as well as\nbalanced growth in Card. Total NII guidance is now about $95.5 billion, implying $3.5 billion of Markets NII. Second, on adjusted expense, we now expect it to be\nabout $95.5 billion, primarily driven by the impact of the weaker dollar, which is largely bottom line neutral. And finally, on credit, we continue to expect the Card\nnet charge-off rate to be approximately 3.6%. So reflecting on the quarter, while the environment remains extremely dynamic in many ways, navigating\nuncertainty is the norm for both us and our clients. But we're now happy to take your questions. So let's open the line for Q&A.\nOperator\nOur first question will come from Christopher McGratty with QBW (sic) [ KBW ].", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:20:15Z"}
