Starting on Page one, the firm reported net income of $18.1 billion, EPS of $6.12 on revenue of $51 billion with an \nROTCE of 28%. These results included the $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares and the $1 billion foundation contribution of the appreciated Visa stock. \nAlso included is $546 million of net investment securities losses in corporate. Excluding these items, the firm had net income of $13.1 billion, EPS of $4.40, and \nan ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights, in the CIB, IB fees were up 50% year-on-year and 17% quarter-on-quarter, and market revenue was up \n10% year-on-year. In CCB, we had a record number of first-time investors and strong customer acquisition across checking accounts and card and we've \ncontinued to see strong net inflows across AWM. Now before I get more detail on the results I just want to mention that starting this quarter we are no longer \nexplicitly calling out the First Republic contribution in the presentation. Going forward, we'll only specifically call it out if it is a meaningful driver in the year-on-year \ncomparison. As a reminder, we acquired First Republic in May of last year, so the prior year quarter only has two months of First Republic results compared to the \nfull three months this quarter. Also in the prior year quarter most of the expenses were in corporate whereas now they are primarily in the relevant \nline-of-business. Now turning to Page 2 for the firm-wide results. The firm reported revenue of $51 billion, up $8.6 billion, or 20% year-on-year. Excluding both the \nVisa gain that I mentioned earlier, as well as last year's First Republic bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion, revenue of $43.1 billion was up $3.4 billion or 9%. NII \nex-Markets was up $568 million or 3%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates, higher revolving balances in card, and the additional month of \nFirst Republic related NII, partially offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances. NIR ex-Markets was up $7.3 billion or 56%. Excluding the \nitems I just mentioned, it was up $2.1 billion or 21%, largely driven by higher investment banking revenue and asset management fees. Both periods included net \ninvestment securities losses. And markets revenue was up $731 million or 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $23.7 billion were up $2.9 billion or 14% year-on-year. \nExcluding the foundation contribution I previously mentioned, expenses were up 9% primarily driven by compensation including revenue related compensation \nand growth in employees. And credit costs were $3.1 billion reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $821 million. Net charge-offs were \nup $820 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card. The net reserve build included $609 million in consumer and $189 million in wholesale. Onto balance \nsheet and capital on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.3% up 30 basis points versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, largely \noffset by capital distributions and higher RWA.

And finally the firm announced \nthat the Board intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend from $1.15 to $1.25 per share in the third quarter of 2024. Now, let's go to our \nbusinesses, starting with CCB on Page 4. CCB reported net income of $4.2 billion on revenue of $17.7 billion, which was up 3% year-on-year. In banking and \nwealth management, revenue was down 5% year-on-year, reflecting lower deposits and deposit margin compression, partially offset by growth and wealth \nmanagement revenue. Average deposits were down 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter. Client investment assets were up 14% year-on-year, \npredominantly driven by market performance. In home lending, revenue of $1.3 billion was up 31% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII, including \none additional month of the First Republic portfolio. Turning to Card services and Auto, revenue was up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher Card \nNII and higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 12% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, \noriginations were $10.8 billion, down 10% coming off strong originations from a year ago, while continuing to maintain healthy margins. Expenses of $9.4 billion \nwere up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by First Republic expenses now reflected in the lines-of-business, as I mentioned earlier, as well as field \ncompensation and continued growth in technology and marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.6 billion reflecting net \ncharge-offs of $2.1 billion up $813 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card, as newer vintages season and credit normalization continues. The net \nreserve build was $579 million, also driven by Card, due to loan growth and updates to certain macroeconomic variables. Next, the Commercial and Investment \nBank on Page 5. Our new Commercial and Investment Bank reported net income of $5.9 billion on revenue of $17.9 billion. You'll note that we are disclosing \nrevenue by business, as well as breaking down the banking and payments revenue by client coverage segment in order to best highlight the relevant trends in \nboth important dimensions of the wholesale franchise. This quarter, IB fees were up 50% year-on-year, and we Ranked Number #1 with year-to-date wallet share \nof 9.5%. And advisory, fees were up 45%, primarily driven by the closing of a few large deals in a week prior year quarter. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully \nwith equity up 56% and debt up 51%, benefiting from favorable market conditions. In terms of the outlook, we're pleased with both the year-on-year and \nsequential improvement in the quarter. We remain cautiously optimistic about the pipeline, although many of the same headwinds are still in effect. It's also worth \nnoting that pull-forward refinancing activity was a meaningful contributor to the strong performance in the first half of the year. Payments revenue was $4.5 billion, \ndown 4% year-on-year", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:20:15Z"}

It's also worth \nnoting that pull-forward refinancing activity was a meaningful contributor to the strong performance in the first half of the year. Payments revenue was $4.5 billion, \ndown 4% year-on-year, as deposit margin compression and higher deposit related client credits were largely offset by fee growth. Moving to markets, total \nrevenue was $7.8 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Fixed income was up 5% with continued strength in securitized products. And equity markets was up 21%, with \nequity derivatives up on improved client activity. We saw record revenue in Prime on growth and client balances amid supportive equity market levels. Security \nservices revenue of $1.3 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher volumes and market levels, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of \n$9.2 billion were up 12% year-on-year, largely driven by higher revenue related compensation, legal expense, and volume related non-compensation expense. In \nbanking and payments, average loans were up 2% year-on-year due to the impact of the First Republic acquisition and flat sequentially. Demand for new loans \nremains muted as middle market and large corporate clients remain somewhat cautious due to the economic environment, and revolver utilization continues to be \nbelow pre-pandemic levels. Also, capital markets are open and are providing an alternative to traditional bank lending for these clients. In CRE, higher rates \ncontinue to suppress both loan origination and payoff activity. Average client deposits were up 2% year-on-year and relatively flat sequentially. Finally, credit \ncosts were $384 million. The net reserve build of $220 million was primarily driven by incorporating the First Republic portfolio in the Firm's modeled approach. \nNet charge-offs were $164 million, of which about half was in office. Then to complete our lines-of-business, AWM on Page 6. Asset and wealth management \nreported net income of $1.3 billion with pre-tax margin of 32%. Revenue of $5.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher \naverage market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher brokerage activity, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.5 billion were up \n12% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, primarily revenue-related compensation, and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:20:15Z"}

And client assets of $5.4 trillion were up 18% year-on-year, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans and\ndeposits were both flat quarter-on-quarter. Turning to corporate on Page 7. Corporate reported net income of $6.8 billion on revenue of $10.1 billion. Excluding\nthis quarter's Visa-related gain and the First Republic bargain purchase gain in the prior year, NIR was up approximately $450 million year-on-year. NII was up\n$626 million year-on-year, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates. Expenses of $1.6 billion were up $427 million year-on-year, excluding\nfoundation contribution expenses were down $573 million year-on-year, largely as a result of moving First Republic related expense out of corporate into the\nrelevant segments. To finish up, we have the outlook on Page 8. Our 2024 guidance, including the drivers, remains unchanged from what we said at Investor\nDay. We continue to expect NII and NII ex-markets of approximately $91 billion, adjusted expense of about $92 billion, and on credit, Card net charge-off rate of\napproximately 3.4%. So to wrap up, the reported performance for the quarter was exceptional and actually represents record revenue and net income.

I think in the press release, right and the\nslide deck, it's $4.9 billion common stock net repurchases. So the question here is what's the governor for you on how much to do every quarter? And I mean I\nunderstand it is a function of okay, how much do we organically grow. But even with that, so you get the organic growth which you had some nice movement\nthere. But you do the organic growth and then is it how much do we earn and we want to buy back our earnings? Or how should we be thinking about what that\nrepurchase volume should be looking like over time? And I remember at Investor Day, the whole debate around I don't want to buy back my stock, but we are\nright? So I get this question from investors quite a bit of how should we be thinking about how you think about what the right amount is to be doing here?", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:20:15Z"}
