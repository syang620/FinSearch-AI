The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back.\nOperator\nThe first question is coming from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. So a couple of questions here. Just one, Jamie, could you talk through the decision to raise the dividend kind of mid-cycle, it felt like, pre-CCAR? And also help us\nunderstand how you're thinking about where that payout ratio, that dividend payout ratio range should be. Because over the past several years, it's been\nsomewhere between 24% and 32%. And so is this suggesting we could be towards the higher end of that range or even expanding above that? Yes. So Betsy, before I answer the question, I want to say something on behalf of all of us at JPMorgan and me personally. I'm thrilled to have you on this call. Betsy, I just wanted to add my welcome back thoughts as well. And just a very minor edit to Jamie's answer. I think he just misspoke when he said $2 billion a\nyear in buybacks, the trajectory. It's $2 billion a quarter. I'm sorry, $2 billion a quarter. Otherwise, I have nothing to add to Jamie's very complete answer. But welcome back, Betsy. Okay. Thank you so much, and I appreciate it. Looking forward to seeing you at Investor Day on May 20. Excellent. Us too.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Jeremy, can you speak to the trends you're seeing with respect to deposit migration in the quarter, if there's been any change? Have you seen that migration start\nto slow or not? Yes, a good question, Jim. I think the simplest and best answer to that is not really. So as we've been saying for a while, migration from checking and savings to\nCDs is sort of the dominant trend that is driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise. That continues. We continue to\ncapture that money in motion at a very high rate. So we're very happy about what that means about the consumer franchise and the level of engagement that\nwe're seeing. Okay. And just a follow-up on that and just sort of bigger picture on NII. Is that sort of the biggest driver of your outlook? Is it migration? Is it the forward curve? Is\nit balances? It sounds like it's migration, but just be curious to hear your thoughts on the biggest drivers of upside or downside. Yes. So I mean, I think the drivers of, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it was in the fourth\nquarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit stale now, but the snap from quarter end had roughly 3 cuts in it.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.\nJohn McDonald\nJeremy, you had mentioned at a conference earlier this year that The Street might need to build in more reserve growth for the Card growth. You've had more\nreserve build. We didn't see that this quarter. Is that just kind of seasonal? And would you still expect the kind of growth math to play out in terms of Card growth\nand reserve build needs? Yes, John. So in short, yes to both questions. So yes, the relative lack of build this quarter is a function of the normal seasonal patterns of Card. Yes, we still\nexpect 12% card loan growth for the full year. And yes, that still means that all else equal, we think the consensus for the allowance build for the back 3 quarters\nis still a little too low if you map it to that expected card loan growth.\nJohn McDonald\nOkay. Got it. And then", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:20:15Z"}

Got it. And then just a follow-up to make it super clear on the idea of the Markets NII, that outlook being revised down by $1 billion, but revenue-neutral. I\nguess the obvious thing is there, there's typically an offset in fee income, and you don't guide to that. But the idea would be, the way you're structuring trades, the\nway the balance sheet is evolving, there's some offset that you'd expect in Markets fees from the lower Markets NII, correct? That is exactly right. And specifically, what's going on here is this shift between the on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet in the financing businesses and prime\nand so on within Markets. And you can actually see a little bit of a pop of the Markets balance sheet in the supplement, and these things are all related.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. I guess just in terms of, Jamie, when you think about the outlook for the economy, would appreciate your thoughts on the health of the customer base, both\ncommercial and consumer. So I would say consumer customers are fine. The unemployment is very low. Home price dropped, stock price dropped. The amount of income they need to\nservice their debt is still kind of low. But the extra money of the lower-income folks is running out -- not running out, but normalizing. And you see credit\nnormalizing a little bit. That's helpful. And just tied to that, as we look at commercial real estate, both for JP and for the economy overall, is higher rates alone enough to create more\nvulnerabilities and issues beyond office CRE? How would you characterize the health of the CRE market? Yes. So I'll put it into 2 buckets. First of all, we're fine. We've got good reserves against office. We think the multifamily is fine. Jeremy can give you more detail on\nthat if you want.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS.\nL. Erika Penala\nGiven that your response to Betsy's question is that 15% CET1 today prepares you for Basel III endgame as written. You earn 22% on -- without the FDIC\nassessment. Ahead of Investor Day, I guess, 6 weeks from now or 5 weeks from now, as we think about that 17% through-the-cycle target, if you're at the right\ncapital level per you guys, where are you overearning today? Right. So interesting framing of the question, Erika. So I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're overearning, right? So obviously, one major area is\nthat we're overearning in deposit margins, especially in consumer. And that's sort of why we're expecting sequential declines in NII, why we've talked about\ncompressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid.\nL.

And just as a follow-up question. You mentioned that the current curve that you set your NII outlook upon is stale. I guess, does it matter? That it seems\nlike the market down-pricing; and obviously no June cut; no September cut; and a toss-up in December, which shouldn't matter for this year. As we think about\nthat $90 billion, does the -- if we price rate cuts out totally, does that matter much? Given that it seems like June is the only one that... Yes. Sorry, Erika. So just quick things on this. One, let's focus on NII ex, not on total NII. So I'd anchor you to the $89 billion. Number two, if you want to do math\nfor like the changes of the average funds rate for the rest of the year and multiply that times the EAR, like be my guest. Looks like as good as an approach as\nany. Which we know are going to be wrong.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on one of your prepared comments. When you talked about -- we will have hopes and expectations for the\nInvestment Banking pipeline to continue to move along. We obviously saw the good movement in ECM and DCM and the lag in Advisory. Can you just talk about\nthat? Sure. Yes. Let me take the IPO first. So we had been a little bit cautious there. Some cohorts and vintages of IPOs had performed somewhat disappointingly. And\nI think that narrative has changed to a meaningful degree this quarter. So I think we're seeing better IPO performance. Obviously, equity markets have been\nunder a little bit of pressure the last few days. But in general, we have a lot of support there, and that always helps. Got it. And I guess I'll just stick on the theme of capital markets. And not surprising at all to see a little bit tougher comp in FICC. I think you guys have kind of\nindicated that maybe a flattish fee pool is a reasonable place, and I know that's impossible to guide on. Yes, a really good question. I would say, in general, that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is actually supportive for\nthe Markets revenue pool. And I think that, together with generally more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of some level of natural background growth, is\none of the reasons that the overall level of Markets revenue has stabilized at meaningfully above what was normal in the pre-pandemic period.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Jamie, I'm just trying to reconcile some of your concerns in your CEO letter. I'm sure the 60 pages, I can see you put a lot of effort into that and it's appreciated.\nBut you talked about scenarios, tail risk, macro risk, geopolitical risk and all that over several years, it's not weeks or months, I get it. Right, Mike. So I'm sorry to tell you that Jamie actually left us because he's at a leadership offsite. That's why he was here remote. So I think he left the call in my\nhands for better or for worse. So -- but let me try to address some of your points and without sort of speaking for Jamie here. Just as a follow-up to that, then. Why is it doing great in terms of Wholesale Payments, given such the dislocations in the world from wars to supply chain\nchanges, everything else, why is Wholesale Payments doing great?

And that's a thing that people need to do\nmore or less no matter what. So that's one piece.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your commentary with Ken's questions were great and clear on Investment Banking for the near term and this year. I have a bigger-picture question in terms of\nyou're so good in spelling out where you're overearning. Do you feel like you're underearning on the Investment Banking side? Yes, Glenn, in short, yes. I mean, I think we're not shy about saying that we're underearning in Investment Banking now. Clearly, we're below cycle averages, as\nyou point out. We've been talking about when do we get back to the pre-pandemic wallet. But as you know, at this point, it was like March 2020, right, it was the\nbeginning of the pandemic. So it's like 4 years ago at this point. So there's been GDP growth, especially in nominal terms during that period, and you would\nexpect the wallet to grow with that. Maybe one other follow-up. You're always investing. You clearly get paid in growth across the franchise as you do. But relative to a lot of other banks that have\nbeen keeping the expenses a lot closer to flat, do you envision an environment -- or maybe I should rephrase that. What type of environment would have\nJPMorgan pull back on this tremendous investment spending wave that you've been going through? Sure. So I think the first thing to say, which is somewhat obvious, but I'm going to say it anyway, is that there are some like auto-governors in this, right? Like\nsome portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue, whether it's volume-related commissions, whether it's incentive compensation, whether it's other\nthings. So there are some auto-correcting elements of the expense base that would happen automatically as part of the normal discipline. So that's point one.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew O'Connor\nYou mentioned one use of capital is to lean into the trading businesses with your balance sheet. And we did see the trading assets going up Q2, which is\nprobably seasonal, but also up a lot year-over-year, but not necessarily translate into higher revenues. And I know they don't like match up necessarily each\nquarter. But maybe just elaborate like how you're leaning into the trading with the balance sheet and how you expect that to benefit you over time. Yes, sure. So let me break this question down into a couple of different parts. So I think what Jamie was sort of suggesting is that you can think of a concept\nthat's kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital, for lack of a better term.\nMatthew O'Connor\nGot it. And then just separately, within the consumer card businesses, you highlighted volumes are up 9% year-over-year. Obviously, still a very strong piece.

And then just separately, within the consumer card businesses, you highlighted volumes are up 9% year-over-year. Obviously, still a very strong piece. Any\ntrends within that, that are worth noting in terms of changes in spend category -- either overall or among certain segments? Maybe a little bit. Jamie already alluded somewhat to this.

But when you kind of triangulate that, you get back to this kind of flattish picture.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Notwithstanding your guys' outlook for uncertainty, and of course, Jamie talked about it in the shareholder letter and addressed it also on this call when he was\nhere earlier. Can you guys share -- or can you share with us the color on what's going on in the corporate lending market in terms of spreads seem to be getting\ntighter? It's not reflecting, I don't think, a real fear out there in the global geopolitical world. And any color just on what you guys are seeing in the leveraged loan\nmarket as well. Right. So I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads, including secondary markets, and to some extent the leverage lending space, is\nthat they're exceptionally tight. And I guess as a tie-in to that question and answer. We've read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country by private credit companies. Can\nyou give us some color on what you're seeing there as both as a competitor but also as a client of JPMorgan, how you balance the 2 out? Where you may see\nthem bidding on business that you'd like, but at the same time, you're supporting their business.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:20:15Z"}
