It was a very strong close to what was a record fiscal year for us. All up, Microsoft Cloud surpassed $168 billion in annual revenue, up 23%. \nThe rate of innovation and the speed of diffusion is unlike anything we have seen. To that end, we are building the most comprehensive suite of AI products and \ntech stack at massive scale. And to provide more context, I want to walk up the stack, starting with Azure. Azure surpassed $75 billion in annual revenue, up \n34%, driven by growth across all workloads. We continue to lead the AI infrastructure wave and took share every quarter this year. We opened new DCs across 6 \ncontinents and now have over 400 data centers across 70 regions, more than any other cloud provider. There is a lot of talk in the industry about building the first \ngigawatt and multi-gigawatt data centers. We stood up more than 2 gigawatts of new capacity over the past 12 months alone. And we continue to scale our own \ndata center capacity faster than any other competitor. Every Azure region is now AI-first. All of our regions can now support liquid cooling, increasing the \nfungibility and the flexibility of our fleet. And we are driving and riding a set of compounding S curves across silicon, systems and models to continuously improve \nefficiency and performance for our customers. Take, for example, GPT4o family of models, which have the highest volume of inference tokens. Through software \n", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:19Z"}

Take, for example, GPT4o family of models, which have the highest volume of inference tokens. Through software \noptimizations alone, we are delivering 90% more tokens for the same GPU compared to a year ago. Beyond the AI fleet, we continue to build our commercial \ncloud to address customers' unique data residency and sovereignty requirements. This quarter, we introduced the Microsoft Sovereign Cloud, the industry's most \ncomprehensive solution spanning both public and private cloud deployments. All of this innovation is driving our strong results. We saw accelerating growth from \nmigrations again this quarter. Nestle, for example, migrated more than 200 SAP instances, 10,000-plus servers, 1.2 petabytes of data to Azure with near 0 \nbusiness disruption. That makes it one of the largest and most successful migrations in business history. The next big accelerator in the cloud will be Quantum, \nand I'm excited about our progress. In fact, earlier this month, we announced the world's first operational deployment of a Level 2 Quantum computer in \npartnership with Atom Computing. This is how we will continue to think and make investments, with decade-long arcs, while making progress every quarter. The \nnext layer is data, which is foundational to every AI application. Microsoft Fabric is becoming the complete data and analytics platform for the AI era, spanning \neverything from SQL to no-SQL, to analytics workloads. It continues to gain momentum with revenue up 55% year-over-year and over 25,000 customers. It's the \nfastest-growing database product in our history. Fabric OneLake spans all databases and clouds, including semantic models from Power BI, and therefore, it is \nthe best source of knowledge and grounding for AI applications and context engineering. Azure Databricks and Snowflake on Azure both accelerated as well. \nCosmos DB and Azure PostgreSQL are both powering mission- critical workloads at scale. OpenAI, for example, uses Cosmos DB in the hot path of every \nChatGPT interaction, storing chat history, user profiles and conversational state. And Azure PostgreSQL stores metadata critical to the operation of ChatGPT as \nwell as OpenAI's developer APIs. This year, we launched Azure AI Foundry to help customers design, customize and manage AI applications and agents at \nscale. Foundry features best-in-class tooling, management, observability and built-in controls for trustworthy AI. Customers increasingly want to use multiple AI \nmodels to meet their specific performance, cost and use case requirements. And with Foundry, they can provision inferencing throughput once and apply it across \nmore models than any other hyperscaler, including models from OpenAI, DeepSeek, Meta, xAI's Grok and, very soon, Black Forest Labs and Mistral AI. We \nsim-shipped 15 models from OpenAI alone on Foundry this year, providing same-day access to state-of-the-art models deeply integrated with our infrastructure \nand tools. And we are seeing accelerated adoption of our new Foundry Agent Service, which is now being used by 14,000 customers to build agents that \nautomate complex tasks. For example, Nasdaq is using foundry to build agents that help customers prepare for Board meetings, cutting prep time by up to 25%. \nAll up, 80% of Fortune 500 already use Foundry.

And when we look narrowly at just the number of tokens served by Foundry APIs, we processed over 500 trillion \nthis year, up over 7x. This is a good indicator of true platform diffusion beyond a few head apps and services. Talking about the app layer, these applications are \nbecoming embedded in our daily work and life. Our family of Copilot apps has surpassed 100 million monthly active users across commercial and consumer. And \nwhen you take a broader look at the engagement of AI features across our products, we have over 800 million monthly active users. Microsoft 365 Copilot is \nbecoming the new way to organize work and workflow and work artifacts. We rolled out our biggest update to Microsoft 365 Copilot to date this quarter, bringing \ntogether chat, search, create, notebooks as well as agents into one intuitive scaffolding. With this innovation and continued product improvements, we are seeing \nreal momentum. Customers continue to adopt Copilot at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite, with strong usage intensity as shown by our \nweek-over-week retention. And we saw the largest quarter of seat adds since launch with a record number of customers returning to buy more seats. Barclays, \nfor example, will roll out Microsoft 365 Copilot to 100,000 employees globally following a successful initial deployment of 15,000. UBS is expanding its deployment", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:19Z"}

And Adobe, KPMG, Pfizer, Wells Fargo all purchased over 25,000 seats this quarter. Tens of\nthousands of organizations have already used our Researcher and Analyst deep reasoning agents in the first weeks of availability. And we have introduced\ngroup-level agents in Teams like Facilitator and Interpreter, which generate real-time translation and notes in meetings. Hundreds of partners like Adobe, SAP,\nServiceNow and Workday have built their own third-party agents that integrate with Copilot and Teams. We are also seeing more customers use Copilot Studio to\nextend Microsoft 365 Copilot and build their own agents. This year, customers created 3 million agents using SharePoint and Copilot Studio. And with Copilot\nTuning, they can easily create agents fine- tuned on their company's data, workflow and style that reflect their unique tone, language and expertise. We're also\nseeing great traction among specific roles and functions, starting with developers. GitHub Copilot continues to have great momentum in IDE with Agent Mode and\nnew form factors like Coding Agent which is capable of asynchronously executing developer tasks. We have 20 million GitHub Copilot users. GitHub Copilot\nenterprise customers increased 75% quarter-over-quarter as companies tailor Copilot to their own codebases, and 90% of the Fortune 100 now use GitHub\nCopilot. More broadly, GitHub usage and repos are seeing explosive growth because of AI. AI projects on GitHub more than doubled over the last year. The\nsurge in vibe coding projects and AI coding agents, whether it is Claude Code, Codex, Cursor or GitHub Copilot, are generating more pull requests and more\nrepos on GitHub. And our Code Review Agent is being used heavily across the platform, performing millions of code reviews each month. In health care, we had\na breakout year for Dragon Copilot. Customers used our ambient AI solutions to document over 13 million physician-patient encounters this quarter, up nearly 7x\nyear-over-year. For example, at Mercyhealth system, more than 1,000 physicians are already using Copilot to reduce administrative burden, so that they can\nfocus on providing better care. They have saved more than 100,000 hours to date and plan to expand to all 5,000 providers. As one physician put it, \"The best\nthing to happen to my practice in 10 years.\" And in security, we were the first in the industry to introduce agents to help defenders autonomously handle\nhigh-volume security and IT tasks. More broadly, AI is driving a fundamental change in the biz apps market as customers shift from legacy systems to agentic\nbusiness applications. Dynamics 365 took share this year. And we are winning customers in every industry, like Verizon with Sales, Domino's Pizza Group with\nERP, 1-800-Flowers with Contact Center. When it comes to consumer apps, we are innovating across all surfaces. In fact, on Monday, we introduced Copilot\nMode in Edge. It's especially exciting to see the innovation coming back to browsers. Copilot Mode brings together Copilot composer, chat, discover, search and\nactions to build the next generation of browser for the AI age. Our Copilot consumer app also continued to see strong growth in engagement and successful\nsessions. And we are bringing Copilot to every Windows 11 PC. With Copilot Vision, you can share your screen with Copilot and get real-time insights and\nassistance on anything. And we are well positioned as we approach Windows 10 end of support in October, thanks to Windows 11 and Copilot+ PCs, which offer\ncustomers compelling security as well as AI value.

Just last week, we added a modern data lake to our SIEM Microsoft Sentinel, bringing together customer\ndata across our first-party tools as well as third-party ecosystem over 350 connectors. We are also extending the systems customers already use for governance,\nidentity, security and management to protect every AI agent. Entra now extends identity permissions, policies and access controls to agents. Defender secures\nnearly 2 million general AI apps. Purview is used by 3/4 of the Microsoft 365 Copilot customers to protect their data. And all up, we now have nearly 1.5 million\nsecurity customers and continue to take share across all major categories we serve. Before I wrap, I want to talk about 2 consumer businesses of ours with\nmassive end-user reach: LinkedIn and Xbox. LinkedIn is home to 1.2 billion members with 4 consecutive years of double-digit member growth. All up, comments\non LinkedIn rose over 30% and video uploads increased over 20% this year. We continue to bring AI to every part of LinkedIn experience, introducing agents\nacross hiring as well as sales. When it comes to Gaming, we have 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices. We are now the top publisher\non both Xbox and PlayStation this quarter with successful launches of Forza Horizon 5 and Oblivion Remastered. The Call of Duty franchise has never been\nstronger. 50 million people have played Black Ops 6; total hours surpassed $2 billion. Minecraft saw record monthly active usage in revenue this quarter, thanks\nin large part to the success of the Minecraft Movie. And we have nearly 40 games in development, so much, much more to come. We surpassed over 500 million\nhours of gameplay stream via the cloud this year. And Game Pass annual revenue was nearly $5 billion for the first time. In closing, we are going through a\ngenerational tech shift with AI, and I have never been more confident in Microsoft's opportunity to drive long-term growth and define what the future looks like.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Amy to walk through our financial results as well as the outlook.\nAmy E. Hood\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This year, we delivered over $281 billion in revenue, up 15% year-over-year, which reflects the broad strength \nof our products and services.

Operating income increased 34%, and 33% in constant currency, driven by continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities.\nNow back to total company results. Capital expenditures were $24.2 billion, including $6.5 billion of finance leases where we recognize the full value at the time of\nlease commencement. Cash paid for PP&E was $17.1 billion. The difference is primarily due to finance leases. More than half our spend was on long-lived assets\nthat will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, and driven by strong\ndemand signals. Cash flow from operations was $42.6 billion, up 15%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier payments.\nAnd this quarter, free cash flow was $25.6 billion. Other income and expense was negative $1.7 billion, primarily due to losses on investments accounted for\nunder the equity method. Our effective tax rate was approximately 17%. And finally, we returned $9.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share\nrepurchases, bringing our total cash return to shareholders to over $37 billion for the full fiscal year. Now moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full\nyear and next quarter is on a U.S. dollar basis, unless specifically noted otherwise.

Now moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full\nyear and next quarter is on a U.S. dollar basis, unless specifically noted otherwise. Let me start with some full year commentary for FY '26. First, FX. Assuming\ncurrent rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase full year revenue growth and COGS growth by approximately 2 points and to increase operating expense\ngrowth by 1 point. Next, building on the strong momentum we saw this past year, we expect to deliver another year of double-digit revenue and operating income\ngrowth in FY '26. We will continue to invest against the expansive opportunity ahead across both capital expenditures and operating expenses given our\nleadership position in commercial cloud, strong demand signals for our cloud and AI offerings, and significant contracted backlog. Capital expenditure growth, as\nwe shared last quarter, will moderate compared to FY '25 with a greater mix of short-lived assets. Due to the timing of delivery of additional capacity in H1,\nincluding large finance lease sites, we expect growth rates in H1 will be higher than in H2. We remain focused on delivering revenue growth and increasing our\noperational agility. And as a result, we expect operating margins to be relatively unchanged year-over-year. And finally, we expect our FY '26 effective tax rate to\nbe between 19% and 20%. Now to our outlook for the first quarter. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue growth by 2 points. Within the\nsegments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by roughly 3 points in Productivity and Business Processes and roughly 1 point in Intelligent Cloud and More\nPersonal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth by roughly 1 point. In Commercial bookings, we expect healthy growth on a\ngrowing expiry base. Bookings growth will again be driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and long-term commitments to our platform.\nAs a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable on their timing, drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 67%, down year-over-year, driven by the impact of continuing to scale our AI infrastructure. We\nexpect Q1 capital expenditures to be over $30 billion, driven by the continued strong demand signals we see. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend\nvariability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next, to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we\nexpect revenue of USD 32.2 billion to USD 32.5 billion, or growth of 14% to 15%, with roughly 3 points of benefit from FX as noted earlier. In M365 Commercial\nCloud, we expect revenue growth to be between 13% and 14% in constant currency, with business trends that remain relatively stable compared to the prior\nquarter. ARPU growth will again be driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. M365 Commercial Products revenue growth should be in the mid- to high single digits. As a\nreminder, M365 Commercial Products includes both the Windows Commercial on-premises components of M365 suites and Office transactional purchasing, both\nof which can be variable due to in-period revenue recognition dynamics. M365 Consumer Cloud revenue growth should be in the low 20s, driven by the January\nprice increase. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the high teens with\ncontinued growth across all workloads. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of USD 30.1 billion to USD 30", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:19Z"}

For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of USD 30.1 billion to USD 30.4 billion, or growth of 25% to 26%, with roughly 1\npoint of benefit from FX as noted earlier. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which can have quarterly variability in year-on-year growth rates depending\non the timing of capacity delivery and when it comes online, as well as from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect\nQ1 revenue growth of approximately 37% in constant currency, driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services on a significant base. Even as we continue\nbringing more data center capacity online, we currently expect to remain capacity- constrained through the first half of our fiscal year. In our on-premises server\nbusiness, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits with the ongoing customer shift to cloud offerings. In More Personal Computing, we expect\nrevenue to be USD 12.4 billion to USD 12.9 billion. Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the mid- to high single digits. We expect the elevated\ninventory levels at the end of Q4 to come down through the quarter in Windows OEM, although the range of potential outcomes remains wider than normal.\nDevices revenue should decline. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens, down sequentially as growth rates\nnormalize following the benefit from third-party partnerships noted earlier. Growth will continue to be driven by volume and revenue per search across Edge and\nBing. Overall search and news advertising revenue growth should be in the low double digits. And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high\nsingle digits. Against a strong prior year comparable, we expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the mid-single digits. Now back to company\nguidance. We expect COGS of USD 24.3 billion to USD 24.5 billion, or growth of 21% to 22%, and operating expense of USD 15.7 billion to USD 15.8 billion, or\ngrowth of 5% to 6%. Other income and expense is estimated to be negative $1.3 billion, primarily due to investments accounted for under the equity method. As a\nreminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. And lastly, we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be between 19%\nand 20%. In closing, we finished the year with double-digit revenue and operating income growth and exceeded the FY '25 operating margin commitment we\nshared a year ago. Our focus remains on investing in security, quality and AI platform and product innovation that delivers value and opportunity to our\ncustomers. We are excited for FY '26.

I've been covering Microsoft for a while, I don't think I've ever seen a quarter where like everything came together\nthis well. So congratulations on that execution. Maybe a little bit longer-term focused question to start out. You guys have always had software start-ups as\ncustomers and potentially emerging competitors. But the AI labs now feel different. Investors are ascribing valuations which assume these companies become\nmajor players in software. They're underwriting revenue forecasts measured in the tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions. And these start-ups have also grown\nto be some of your biggest customers, so they're contributing significantly to Microsoft today. So it seems like there's a lot of potential opportunity in supporting\nthose businesses, but also it's not certain that they're going to stay your customers as they scale. They could in-source some of that infrastructure. And they very\nlikely emerge as potential competitors. So as managers of Microsoft, as managers of the capital, how do you guys manage that risk versus reward with these\nquickly emerging AI labs and these AI start-ups? Thanks, Keith, for the question. I don't think it's that different from even sort of the previous era. There's always been, I'll call it, head apps or head -- new\ncompanies that emerge, that in fact are very needed in order to birth a new platform. Back in the day when I was getting started on Azure, I used to look over the\nlake and sort of see Netflix and Amazon, and I say, \"I wish Netflix ran on Azure.\" And in some sense, that's kind of what we now have, which is the largest AI\nworkloads run on Azure. And when that happens, you learn the workload faster, you optimize the entire platform faster, everything from what you're doing -- what\nwe're doing with Cosmos DB for a chat interface like ChatGPT or Copilot, is, guess what, going to be the most relevant for any AI application going forward. The\nentire data stack that we have now built is going to be optimized for what people describe as one of the hardest challenges of any AI application, called context\nengineering, right, which is how do you collect your data and then make sure that the context around the problems remain stable over a long period so that you\nget the intelligence to actually deliver the results you want. So these are workload results that are invaluable for us to learn to build both the products as well as\nthe platform. And then broadly, they -- or rather over time, there will be broad diffusion. In fact, one of the things that Amy and I track is not just the head app\nusage, but also what's the sort of all the Tier 2 applications that are being built. So that sort of -- that speaks a little bit, Keith, to I think your question, is as long as\nwe have head apps shaping the platform and then, after that, we have the broad diffusion happen, which in some sense both of those is what we are seeing. So I\nfeel very good about our being in decent standing going forward.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.\nMark L. Moerdler\nI'd also give you my congratulations. Amazing. I didn't know how you were going to beat last quarter, and you did it. So congratulations.

I had one question on Copilot, and I'm obviously a happy user here at Barclays. If you think about it, the one thing that we're all\nrealizing is that Copilot is the AI part, but data is becoming more and more important. And then from there on, we can start thinking about agents. Where is the --\nwhat are you seeing in your customer conversations, Satya, about like that understanding that Copilot is actually just the starting point, and then, from there on,\nit's becoming like much, much broader? Yes. I think that that's right. Even inside of Copilot, I'm sure you're seeing it, right? You now have Analyst and Researcher, to just talk about 2 examples, and of\ncourse, people, all the third-party agents. So yes, there is a lot more of it's just not request, respond. It's about spawning essentially applications that then go do\nwork and come back. But the UI still remains very important, right, even for asynchronous work. To instruct the asynchronous work, you need UI. And to monitor\nasynchronous work, you need UI. Maybe different, it may not be a chat interface. And of course, you need a way to then inspect what the asynchronous work is,\nright? So even take the example I was giving on GitHub. Even if you're not using GitHub Copilot to create the core check-in or the pull request, interestingly\nenough, we're seeing massive increase to GitHub Copilot Code Review Agent even if you used maybe Claude Code or whatever else to write the code. So that's\nI think what's happening across all of these systems. So you're absolutely right that you need -- it starts with some kind of a UI that's more chat focused, but it\nquickly goes beyond it. And you see it in M365, you see it in Dynamics 365 and you see it in GitHub.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:19Z"}
