Thank you for taking the question and very nice quarter. The pace of innovation you guys have been putting out has been pretty amazing. And the new\nproducts garnering traction probably faster than we've expected on our side of the equation. But we're also working in an overall spending environment, that\nremains volatile, and I think investors are getting more concerned on it. So two questions on this, one, based on sort of the new products and the innovation, do\nyou think you guys can sustain the type of commercial growth that we saw in Q1 as we go through the year or is the environment too tricky for that? And then\nwhen it relates to investment, Amy, you've been able to keep overall OpEx growth very low, and it was very low this quarter. At some point, should we be thinking\nabout a return to a more aggressive investment behind all this product innovation? Maybe I can start, Keith, and Amy you can add to it. Overall there are multiple things, Keith, they're all happening obviously simultaneously. If you just take Azure\nand try to characterize, where's the growth for Azure coming from or what sort of drivers for Azure numbers, there are three things all happening in parallel. Like,\nfor example, take cloud migrations. A good reminder of where we are and even the core cloud migration story is the new Oracle announcement. Once we\nannounced that the Oracle databases are going to be available on Azure, we saw a bunch of unlock from new customers who have significant Oracle estates that\nhave not yet moved to the cloud because they needed to rendezvous with the rest of the app estate in one single cloud. And so we're excited about that. So in\nsome sense, even the financial services sector, for example, is a good place where there's a lot of Oracle that still needs to move to the cloud. The second thing,\nof course, is the workloads start, then workloads get optimized, and then new workloads start, and that cycle continues. We'll lap some of those optimization\ncycles that were fairly extreme perhaps in the second half of our fiscal. And the third thing is, for us, that's unique and different is new workload starts around AI.\nGiven our leadership position, we are seeing complete new projects start, which are AI projects. And as you know, AI projects are not just about AI meters, they\nhave lots of other cloud meters as well. So that sort of gives you one side of what's happening in terms of enterprise. The other piece is on the SaaS side,\nobviously, again, this is a new product that's going to go through the enterprise adoption cycle. The results around productivity, which we demonstrated with\nGitHub Copilot, is what's giving us good confidence and our customers, more importantly, good confidence around what these products represent in terms of\nvalue. And so we are in the very early innings there, and so we look forward to seeing the traction for these products going forward.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:19Z"}

AI has been far stronger than expected, beat your guidance for Azure this quarter. And while\nyou discussed higher utilization and more GPUs have helped, has the fact that Microsoft has a full AI devstack Copilot reference architecture and plugin\narchitecture bidding a meaningful factor, not just from a revenue perspective, but also even potentially from a margin perspective? In addition, can you give us\nany color on whether Azure GPU is predominantly model training or are we seeing a lot of inferencing yet from clients? Thanks. No. Thank you for the question, Mark. Yeah, it is true that we have -- the approach we have taken is a full stack approach all the way from whether it's ChatGPT\nor Bing Chat or all our Copilots, all share the same model. So in some sense, one of the things that we do have is very, very high leverage of the one model that\nwe used -- which we trained, and then the one model that we are doing inferencing at scale. And that advantage sort of trickles down all the way to both utilization\ninternally, utilization of third parties, and also over time, you can see the sort of stack optimization all the way to the silicon because the abstraction layer to which\nthe developers are riding is much higher up than low-level kernels if you will. So, therefore, I think there is a fundamental approach we took, which was a technical\napproach of saying we'll have Copilots and Copilot stack all available. That doesn't mean we don't have people doing training for open source models or\nproprietary models. We also have a bunch of open source models. We have a bunch of fine-tuning happening, a bunch of RLHF happening. So there's all kinds\nof ways people use it. But the thing is, we have scale leverage of one large model that was trained and one large model that's being used for inference across all\nour first-party SaaS apps, as well as our API in our Azure AI service\u2026", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:19Z"}

Thank you. You sound very optimistic about the opportunity in the office space with Copilot coming out now very soon.

Thank you. No. Thanks. The question, Ramo, the good news is two-fold, one is the fact that, what is 40% of the Fortune 100 are already in the preview and are using the\nproduct and I think you all have also done lots of checks and the feedback is very, very positive. And, in fact, the interesting thing is, it's not any one tool, right?\nWhich is the feedback even sort of is very clear that it's the all up. You just keep hitting the Copilot button across every surface, right, whether it's in Word to\ncreate documents, in Excel to, do analysis, or PowerPoint or Outlook or Teams just like that. Clearly, the Teams meeting, which is an intelligent recap, it's not just\na dumb transcript. It's like having a knowledge base of all your meetings that you can query and add to essentially the knowledge terms of your enterprise. And so\nwe are seeing broad usage across and the interesting thing is, by different functions, whether it's in finance or in sales by roles, we are seeing productivity gains\nlike we saw with developers and GitHub Copilot. So that's the data. We are very excited about our Ignite conference, where we will talk a lot more about all of the\nuse cases and what's -- where's the value and give more prescriptive guidance on how people can deploy. But so far so good, as far as the data is and the\nfeedback is. And of course, this is an enterprise product, I mean, at the end of the day, we are grounded on enterprise cycle times in terms of adoption and ramp,\nand it's incrementally priced, so, therefore that all will apply still. But at least for something completely new to have this level of usage already and this level of\nexcitement is something we're very, very pleased with.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:19Z"}
