Brian, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the drivers of the 38% AWS margins. I know you mentioned the\n200 basis points related to the useful lives push-out, but just how to think about sustainability kind of in the 30s there going forward? And then perhaps related the\nstep-up in CapEx that you saw in 3Q, you gave the full-year number, which was helpful. Any kind of early read or thoughts on how we should think about 2025?\nThanks so much. Yeah, I'll take the capex part of that. As Brian said in his opening comments, we expect to spend about $75 billion in 2024. I suspect we'll spend more than that in\n2025. And the majority of it is for AWS and specifically, the increased bumps here are really driven by Generative AI. As I was mentioning in my own opening\ncomments, our AI business is a multi-billion dollar business that's growing triple-digit percentages year-over-year and is growing three times faster at its stage of\nevolution than AWS did itself. We thought AWS grew pretty fast. And so the thing to remember about the AWS business is the cash life cycle is such that the\nfaster we grow demand, the faster we have to invest capital in data centers and networking gear and hardware. And of course, in the hardware of AI, the\naccelerators or the chips are more expensive than the CPU hardware. And so we invest in all of that upfront in advance of when we can monetize it with\ncustomers using the resources. But of course, a lot of these assets are many year useful life assets. Data centers, for instance, are useful assets for 20 to 30\nyears. And so I think we've proven over time that we can drive enough operating income and free-cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested\ncapital business and we expect the same thing will happen here with Generative AI. It is a really unusually large maybe once in a lifetime type of opportunity. And\nI think our customers, the business and our shareholders will feel good about this long-term that we're aggressively pursuing it.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.

And if we look back at the \nmarket in like the early 2010s is hypercompetitive on pricing, your margins were below 15%, I believe, back then. And it seems like a lot of that is what's going on \nright now in AI with these new AI data centers where you've got competitive pricing and suboptimal utilization just in the whole industry. So as that revenue line \ngrows from where it is today to tens of billions of dollars in coming years, how does that margin come on from the AI data centers versus your existing kind of\n\n30-plus-percent margin at AWS? Any thoughts on how quickly you can close the gap and how that looks on the new AI workloads versus maybe this mid-30s that\nthe core business is running at? Thank you very much. Yeah. So some quick context, Ross. I think one of the least understood parts about AWS, over time, is that it is a massive logistics challenge. If you think about,\nwe have 35 or so regions around the world, which is an area of the world where we have multiple data centers, and then probably about 130 availability zone\nthrough data centers, and then we have thousands of SKUs we have to land in all those facilities. And if you land too little of them, you end up with shortages,\nwhich end up in outages for customers. So most don't end up with too little, they end up with too much. And if you end up with too much, the economics are\nwoefully inefficient. And I think you can see from our economics that we've done a pretty good job over time at managing those types of logistics and capacity.\nAnd it's meant that we've had to develop very sophisticated models in anticipating how much capacity we need, where, in which SKUs and units. And so I think\nthat the AI space is, for sure, earlier stage, more fluid and dynamic than our non-AI part of AWS. But it's also true that people aren't showing up for 30,000 chips\nin a day. They're planning in advance. So we have very significant demand signals giving us an idea about how much we need. And I think that one of the\ndifferences if you were able to get inside of the economics of the different types of providers here is how well they manage that utilization and that capacity. It has\na very direct impact on what kind of margins you have over time and what kind of capital efficiency you also have over time. And so I think you're right, Ross, that\nthere are some similarities in the early days here of AI, where the offerings are new and people are very excited about it. It's moving very quickly and the margins\nare lower than what they -- I think they will be over time. The same was true with AWS. If you looked at our margins around the time you were citing, in 2010, they\nwere pretty different than they are now. I think as the market matures over time, there are going to be very healthy margins here in the Generative AI space.\nOperator\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

Maybe a two-parter, if I can. Looking at the results in the commerce business, there's a clear sort of pattern emerging with respect\nto ASPs versus unit growth. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of consumer behavior and the propensity to be receptive to either lower\nASP items or discounts among consumer behavior? And then the second part would be, can you talk a little bit about some of the strategic initiatives you're\nbuilding for the long term around capitalizing on lower ASP items and the potential shift to more consumables and the base of consumption habits on the\nplatform? Thanks so much. Yeah, hi, Eric, thank you for your question. Yeah, you're right. Q3 unit volume was strong, 12% worldwide. It's pretty similar in North America versus international.\nAnd the consumer factors, we've seen a continuation of many of the things we've discussed over the first -- or last few quarters. Customers looking for deals and\nare price conscious. This matches up well with our Prime events where we were -- which were well received and saved billions for our -- billions of dollars for our\nPrime members. It also led to Prime member -- paid Prime member growth accelerating in the quarter, which is hugely impactful for us. A lot of our best offers\nand deliveries are tuned to Prime membership, and it's the best deal in retail. So with all the benefits you get for the subscription price, so those are all positive\nsigns. When you look at the split between revenue growth and unit growth, you do see some impact of the lower ASP products that we're selling as well as some\nof the trade down that consumers are doing. But we take that as a real positive, seeing the growth in everyday essential categories, which are really predicated\non speed. So it's -- you have to have fast delivery to be able to sell the those products to customers. And when you do, it results in a stickier consumer\nrelationship, higher orders, building larger baskets, which help our ship economics, and repeat orders are stronger. So those are all positive signs, and we'll take\nany short-term degradation in ASP because what we're focused on primarily is free cash flow here. And we see the ability to unlock all new elements of the\nconsumer spend.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:12:18Z"}

Thank you. Maybe a couple of questions. Just on the cloud, are you at all capacity constrained, and will the new Trainium or NVIDIA chips maybe even\ndrive sales growth faster? And then secondly and I know there's been some competition from some of the more traditional retailers growing quickly online. Maybe\ntalk about maybe the advantages that Amazon has with a fulfillment center distribution versus store distribution? Any thoughts on that? Thank you. Well, on cloud, Justin, what I would tell you is that we -- I believe we have more demand that we could fulfill if we had even more capacity today. I think pretty \nmuch everyone today has less capacity than they have demand for, and it's really primarily chips that are the area where companies could use more supply. And \nso we have -- we're growing at a very rapid rate and have grown a pretty big business here in the AI space and it's early days, but I actually believe that the rate \nof growth there has a chance to improve over time as we have bigger and bigger capacity. And I think that one of the reasons I mentioned in my opening \ncomments that we have a very deep partnership with NVIDIA. We tend to be their lead partner on most of their new chips. We were the first to offer H200s in EC2 \ninstances. And I expect us to have a partnership for a very long time that matters. It's also true that for customers that start to scale out their implementations on \nthe inference side, particularly, they realize pretty quickly that it can get costly. And it's really why we have pursued building Trainium and Inferentia, which is our \ncustom silicon. And the second version of Trainium, Trainium2 will start to ramp up in the next few weeks. And I think it's going to be very compelling for\n\ncustomers on a price performance basis. And we have a lot of customer interest. We have gone back to our manufacturing partners a couple of times now to\nproduce a lot more Trainium than we anticipated. Some of that, for sure, is due to the fact that we just -- we have very large demand, and we want more capacity\nand supply to be able to provide them. But a lot of it is that customers are excited about the price performance that they believe they're going to get in Trainium.\nSo I think it's a very significant opportunity for us in the AWS space, and it's going to be a very significant opportunity for customers. I think on the retail side, I'd\nstart by just saying that we've always believed that competition is very positive and very healthy. It's good for consumers, good for businesses. It's actually great\nfor innovation. And if you look at the retail space, it's a very, very large market segment. I mean, we have a pretty big retail business, and yet we're only about 1%\nof the market segment share of the worldwide global retail market segment. And still about 80% to 85% of that market segment share lives in physical stores. And\nso if you believe that equation is going to flip in the next 10 to 20 years, which we do, there's just a lot of opportunity not just for us but for several players. There\nwon't be only one successful player. I do think that we have some elements of our customer experience that are really unusual and unlike others. I think we have\nmeaningfully broader selection than almost all the players that you probably have seen and heard of. We have low prices with very significant deals that we go\nwork with our third-party selling partners around key holiday shopping occasions. And then we have very significant advantages and speed of delivery to\ncustomers. And we just continue to see in every bit of testing and analysis that we do, that the faster that we're able to promise customers that we can get them\ntheir items, the more frequently they", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:12:18Z"}

And so those are things that are pretty different. I also\nthink we have a way of prioritizing customers that I think is unusual. Our orientation, our DNA and our core at Amazon starts with the customer, and everything\nmoves backwards from that. Any meeting you go to inside of Amazon, we're always asking ourselves what do customers want? What do customers say? What\ndo they not like about the experience? What could be better? And that customer orientation is very important, not just in how you take care of customers, but the\nworld changes quickly all the time. And the technology is changing really quickly. And so if you have the combination of strong technical aptitude, propensity and\na passion for inventing and then also a customer orientation where it drives everything you do, I think you have an opportunity to continue to build great trust in a\nbusiness over a long period of time.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:12:18Z"}
