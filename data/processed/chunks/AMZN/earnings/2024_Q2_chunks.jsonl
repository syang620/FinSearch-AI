Maybe a two-parter on AWS. There's been a theme during the last\ncouple of weeks of earnings of the potential to over-invest as opposed to under-invest in AI as a broad theme. I'm curious, Andy, if you have a perspective on that\nin terms of thinking about elements of capitalizing on the theme longer term against the potential for pace or cadence of investment on AWS as a segment. And\nthe second part would be coming back to your comments on custom silicon. How do you feel about custom silicon, both from a pace of investment and then more\nbroadly, how you think about it as a return profile on a pivot to more custom silicon in your portfolio over the medium to long term? Thanks so much. Thanks, Eric. I'll take them in order. I think on the question about investment in AWS and on the AI side, I think where I'd start is, I think one of the least\nunderstood parts about AWS over the last 18 years has been what a massive logistics challenge it is to run that business. If you think about the fact that we have\nabout 35 regions and think of a region as multiple -- a cluster of multiple data centers and about 110 availability zones, which is roughly equivalent to a data\ncenter, sometimes it includes multiple. And then if you think about having to land thousands and thousands of SKUs across the 200 AWS services in each of\nthose availability zones at the right quantities, it's quite difficult. And if you end up actually with too little capacity, then you have service disruptions, which really\nnobody does because it means companies can't scale their applications. So most companies deliver more capacity than they need. However, if you actually\ndeliver too much capacity, the economics are pretty woeful and you don't like the returns of the operating income. And I think you can tell from having -- we\ndisclosed both our revenue and our operating income in AWS that we've learned over time to manage this reasonably well. And we have built models over a long\nperiod of time that are algorithmic and sophisticated that land the right amount of capacity. And we've done the same thing on the AI side. Now AI is newer. And\nit's true that people take down clumps of capacity in AI that are different sometimes. I mean -- but it's also true that it's not like a company shows up to do a\ntraining cluster asking for a few hundred thousand chips the same day? Like you have a very significant advance signal when you have customers that want to\ntake down a lot of capacity. So while the models are more fluent, it's also true that we've built, I think, a lot of muscle and skill over time in building these capacity\nsignals and models. And we also are getting a lot of signal from customers on what they need. I think that it's -- the reality right now is that while we're investing a\nsignificant amount in the AI space and in infrastructure, we would like to have more capacity than we already have today. I mean we have a lot of demand right\nnow. And I think it's going to be a very, very large business for us. On the custom silicon point, yeah, it's really interesting what's happened here. And it's also --\nour strategy and approach here has been informed by running AWS for 18 years. When we started AWS, we had and still have a very deep partnership with Intel\non the generalized CPU space. But what we found from customers is that they -- when you find a -- an offering that is really high value for you and high return,\nyou don't actually spend less, even though you're spending less per unit, you spend less per unit, but it enables you and free you up to do so much more", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:12:18Z"}

And then when you're spending more, you actually want better price performance than what you're getting. And a lot of\ntimes, it's hard to get that price performance from existing players unless you decide to optimize yourself for what you're learning from your customers and you\npush that envelope yourself. And so we built custom silicon in the generalized CPU space with Graviton, which we're on our fourth model right now. And that has\nbeen very successful for customers and for our AWS business is it saves customers about -- up to about 30% to 40% price performance versus the other leading\nx86 processors that they could use. And we saw the same trend happening about five years ago in the accelerator space in the GPU space, where the products\nare good, but there was really primarily one provider and supply was more scarce than what people wanted. And people -- our customers really want improved\nprice performance all the time. And so that's why we went about building Trainium, which is our training chip and Inferentia, which is our inference chip, which\nwe're on second versions of both of those, they will have very compelling relative price performance and in a world where it's hard to get GPUs today, the supply\nis scarce and all the schedules continue to move over time. Customers are quite excited and demanding at a high clip. Our custom silicon, and we're producing it\nas fast as we can. I think that's going to have very good return profile just like Graviton has and I think it will be another differentiating feature around AWS relative\nto others.\n\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

I have two. So the first one I wanted to ask about in the second quarter, the retail gross margins that we're trying to do the monkey\nmath, look a little weaker than expected. Was there any extra pressure on retail gross margins because of discounting? Or is that where Kuiper is? Or sort of how\ndo we think about some of the drivers of retail gross margins in the quarter at shipping? And the second one, Andy, in the past, you talked about cost to serve\nimprovement and sort of getting the North America margins back to pre-pandemic levels. Can you just remind us again sort of the internal philosophy about\nexecuting on that? Is there a time line to deliver on that? Sort of how are you sort of balancing showing that profitability improvement over the next couple of years\nversus pressing on new investments like Kuiper and perhaps reinvesting some of those profits over the next couple of years? Brian, let me start with the first question on North America margins. So if you look at the segment operating margins, we did decrease 20 basis points sequentially\nfrom Q1 to Q2. I'll remind you that we have - see the annual step-up in stock-based compensation at the end of Q1 each year, and that added about $1.8 billion\nof stock-based comp expense in Q2 versus Q1. So that's impacting to some extent, all three segments. But even with that stock-based comp step up, the stores\npart of the North America segment, increase the margin again last quarter. So we're continuing to see strong improvements in cost to serve as well as\nimprovement in speed, added selection, better safety. So a lot of the key areas that we're hitting on are strong. What you're seeing for the segment is that some\nof our investment areas had a tick up in expenses and investment in Q2 versus Q1. And that's not unheard of. Q1 is usually the lightest investment quarter, things\nlike Prime Video and devices have less investment going on in those quarters. But the one thing I'd point out, I think we mentioned it is Kuiper stepping up a bit in\nQ2 versus Q1 as we start to build satellites that we'll launch in Q3 and Q4 this year. And your second question, Brian, I continue and the team continues to\nbelieve that we have the opportunity to expand the margin in our stores business. And as I've said on a number of the calls that we've done, it's not going to\nhappen in one quarter, it's not going to happen in one fell swoop, it's going to take work over a long period of time. But I think that one of the silver linings, if you\nwill, about year and half ago in the ricochet of the pandemic and all the growth that we had and the cost to serve challenges that we had was, it really forced us to\nreevaluate everything in the network. And really, even our most closely felt beliefs over a long period of time. And what it did was unveiled a number of\nopportunities that we believe we have to keep driving cost to serve down. And the first one that you've seen play out over the last year or so has been the\nregionalization of the U.S. network. And I think one thing to remember about that is that while it's had even bigger impact than maybe we theorized when we first\narchitected it, we're still not done fully honing it. There's a lot of ways that we continue to optimize that U.S. regionalization that we think will continue to bear lower\ncost to serve. But at the same time, we found a number of other areas where we believe we can take our cost down while also improving the customer\nexperience.

But at the same time, we found a number of other areas where we believe we can take our cost down while also improving the customer\nexperience. One of the great things about regionalization was it not only took our cost to serve down, but it meaningfully changed the speed with which we're able\nto get items to customers. And so we have a number of those other opportunities. Another example of that is regionalizing our inbound network, which is also\ngoing to lower our cost to serve and get items more close to end users and diminish the amount of time it takes to get them to customers. We have a number of\nthings that we're working on that allow us to combine more units per box, which lowers our costs as well and a lot of customers like that better because it's better\nfor the environment, having more units per box. So I think we have a lot of opportunities to continue to take down our cost to serve. And strategically and\nphilosophically, just two other things as you were alluding to that question. I think that from our perspective, as we're able to take cost to serve down, it means\nthat we're able to afford to have more selection that we're able to offer to customers. And there are a lot of lower ASP items there, average selling price items that\nwe don't stock because they're not economic to stock with our current cost to serve. But as we work hard to make progress like we are on lowering our cost to\nserve, that allows us to add more selection. And we see this time in and time out that we -- when we add more selection, customers actually consider us for more\nof their purchases and spend more with us down the line. I think the other thing, too, I would tell you is that I don't see it as being binary in any way, nor have I\nreally ever seen it this way in the history of the company. I've been here 27 years. But we don't think of it as we can either be investing or we can be working on\ntrying to take our cost to serve down. We believe we can do both. If you think about the examples you gave, the stores business and the Kuiper business are --\nthey're just different people working on those businesses. So our stores team is going to continue to work really hard on expanding selection and keeping prices\nlow and speeding up our delivery times and driving our cost to serve down while our Kuiper team is working on how to figure out how to help the 400 million to\n500 million households around the world who don't have broadband connectivity get that connectivity and allow them to do a lot of the things we take for granted\ntoday with broadband connectivity. So they're not going to be binary. We're going to work on them both at the same time.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore.

Two questions. AWS, those three factors that are causing that kind of acceleration in Q2 and recovery in growth rates from a year ago,\nthose sound sustainable? Is there any reason that we shouldn't see sort of ongoing acceleration at some level through the back half of the year? And secondly, I\njust want to ask about a small segment of pharmacy. It seems to me like at least anecdotally I seem to lean more into marketing for that and survey work\nsuggests to us that there's kind of greater consumer interest in that. Just talk about where that business is for you? And is it at a point where you feel like you\nmove beyond early adoption and are leaning into kind of getting more mass Amazon customer adoption? Thank you. On the AWS question, it's always hard to predict what the growth rates are going to be, and it's a relatively large business at $105 billion revenue run rate at this \npoint. But I do think that we have seen the lion's share of the cost optimization happen. And I also do believe that pre-pandemic, we were on this March where \nmost companies are trying to figure out how to modernize their infrastructure, which really means moving from on-premises to the cloud because they can save \nmoney and invent that more quickly and get better developer productivity. And then the pandemic happen and people were in survival mode and then a difficult \neconomy came and people are trying to save money. And we just see people going back to asking themselves, why aren't we taking this low hanging fruit here. I \nmean it makes -- I don't want to run my own data centers. I can actually be more cost-effective and invent more quickly from my customers if I'm using the cloud. \nAnd AWS with just a lot more functionality, stronger operational performance and security, which really matters to customers as well and a deeper partner \necosystem continues to be the partner of choice as people are moving to the cloud. And I think the generative AI component is in its very early days. It's -- as I \nsaid, we kind of sometimes look at it and say that it's interesting that we have a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate already in AI, and it's so early. But if we look at\n\nthe amount of demand that we have from customers right now, it's very significant. So I think all three of those things have a chance and will likely continue over\ntime. And we'll see where that growth rate nets out over the next number of years. I think that -- the one other thing I would say about that, too, Mark, is that -- the\nbusiness today, as I mentioned, it's a $105 billion revenue run rate business, about 90% of the global IT spend is still on premises. And if you believe that\nequation is going to flip, which I do, there's a lot of growth ahead of us in AWS as the leader in all those dimensions I mentioned. But I also think that generative\nAI itself and AI as a whole it's going to be really large. I mean it is not something that we originally factored when we were thinking about how large AWS could be\nand unlike the non-AI space, where you're basically taking all of this infrastructure that's been built on premises over a long period of time and working with\ncustomers to help them migrate it to the cloud, which is a lot of work, by the way. In the generative AI space, it's going to get big fast and it's largely all going to be\nbuilt from the get-go in the cloud, which allows the opportunity for those businesses to continue to grow. On the pharmacy side, I think you're right that you're\nseeing that business continue to grow and to get more resonance with customers.

And I think it was always a relatively natural extension for us to build a\npharmacy offering from our retail business. But I think a lot of what you see in the business has grown really quickly, a lot of what you've seen is that the work that\nthe team has done on the customer experience over the last 18 months has really paid off. Customers love the customer experience of Amazon Pharmacy. And\nespecially, by the way, when you think about the experience and the speed and ease with which you can order versus walking into a pharmacy in a physical\nstore, if you walk into pharmacies and -- in cities today, it's a pretty tough experience with how much is locked behind cabinets, where you have to press a button\nto get somebody to come out and open the cabinets for you and a lot of shop lifting going on in the stores. So the combination of what's happening in the physical\nworld and how much improved we've made our pharmacy experience is driving a lot of customer resonance and buying behavior. I think also you see us\ncontinuing to expand there. We expanded our RxPass package and program to Medicare members, that program allows customers and members to be -- Prime\nmembers to be able to get up to 60 common medications for just $5 a month. And we continue to launch same-day delivery of medications to cities. We have\nthem in 8 cities, including Los Angeles and New York today with plans to expand to more than a dozen cities by the end of the year.

What are you seeing in those sales motions? Thank you. On the second part of your question, Brent, what I would say is that it's true in analytics, but it's even maybe more so true in AI, which is that it's quite difficult to\nbe able to do AI effectively if your data is not organized in such a way that you can access that data and run the models on top of them and then build the\napplication. So when we work with customers, and this is true both when we work directly with customers as well as when we work with systems integrator\npartners, everyone is in a hurry to get going on doing generative AI and one of the first questions that we ask is show us where your data is, show us what your\ndata lake looks like, show us how you're going to access that data.
