Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just as we look at the revenue guidance and the outlook, Susan, any color you can share on just kind of the state of the\noverall digital ad market? And you've highlighted some areas where you are seeing strength versus kind of some of the idiosyncratic efforts you've made to kind\nof improve the efficacy of the ad product. Thank you. Hi, Mark. We are continuing to see healthy global advertising demand, and we are also delivering ongoing ad performance improvements just related to all of the\ninvestments that we've continued to make over time. And improving the sort of ads, targeting ranking, delivery, all of the fundamental infrastructure there. And we\nexpect that all of that will continue to benefit ad spend in Q3. We do expect year-over-year growth to slow in Q3, as we are lapping strong growth from\nChina-based advertisers, as well as strong Reels impression growth from a year ago. And we also expect modestly larger FX headwinds in Q3 based on current\nrates.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.

I'll just ask one. You called out building community size and what's happened in the United States, as well as\nThreads. How are you thinking about those newer faster-growing elements of either Messaging or Threads as a platform and the mix between the potential for\nengagement growth and overall monetization longer term of either the messaging layer or Threads and what you are most excited about there to build to sort of\ncapitalize on scale but bring it back towards monetization? Thank you. Eric, I would just add to that in terms of [nearer-term] (ph) sources of impression growth, we really expect that video is going to remain a source of impression\ngrowth for us in the second half. On Instagram, we expect Reels to continue to drive growth, while on Facebook, we expect to grow overall video time, while\nincreasing the mix of short-form video, which creates more impression growth opportunities. And generally we expect continued community growth foracross our\napps.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.

Thank you. I just want to get back to the comment on US young adult user growth, especially maybe on Facebook and Instagram. I know you made a big\nchange with Reels a couple of years ago. But what are those users doing on Facebook and Instagram? And can you give us any quantification of the usage\ngrowth? Thank you. Thanks, Justin. So building products with young adults in mind has been a core priority area for the Facebook team in recent years, and we've been very\nencouraged to see these efforts translate into engagement growth with this cohort. We have seen healthy growth in young adult app usage in the US and Canada\nfor the past several quarters. And we have seen that products like Groups and Marketplace have seen particular traction with young adults. Posting to groups in\nthe US and Canada has been growing. That's been boosted mainly by young adults. And we also see that they are active users of Marketplace, which has\nbenefited from product improvements and strong demand for second-hand products in the US.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.

It is a great, somewhat under-monetized or arguably very under-monetized asset. I know you\nindirectly monetize it and it's a very large marketplace. It may even be bigger than eBay. Your thoughts on what you may want to do in the future in terms of\nmonetizing it, in part maybe even improve the quality of the Marketplace. And then secondly, I just want to ask you about headcount. It is down about 1%\nyear-over-year. You are pretty much back at par with where the employee headcount was prior to significant reduction. How should we think about headcount\ngrowth going forward? Did you talk about a significant growth in CapEx? Should we expect a moderate growth in headcount significant? Any thoughts on that\nwould be helpful. Thank you. Thanks Mark. On your first question about Marketplace, again we are obviously excited that it's been one of the drivers of strength in young adults. I would\nprobably just say that more generally, Marketplace is one prong in a broader commerce strategy that we have which continues to be focused on basically creating\nthe best shopping experience on our platform. Marketplace is obviously consumer oriented. The broader part of the commerce strategy is about making it easier\nfor businesses to advertise their products, for buyers to find and purchase relevant items on our platform. And to that end, I\u2019d say that we feel quite happy with\nalso the investments we've been making in Shops ads. Shops ads revenue is growing at a strong year-over-year pace. We are seeing Shops ads drive\nincremental performance for advertisers, and it's also working well in combination with some of our other products like Advantage+ shopping. Your second\nquestion was about headcount. We continue to be disciplined about where we are allocating new headcount to ensure that it's really focused on our core\ncompany priorities, but we are also working down a prior hiring underrun. And as we further close that hiring underrun over the course of this year, I do expect\nthat we will end 2024 with in-seat reported headcount that is meaningfully higher than where we ended 2023. We aren't providing sort of 2025 headcount growth\nexpectations yet as we haven't started our budgeting process yet. But again, I expect that we\u2019ll primarily target our hiring to focus on priority areas, and we will be\nrunning a very disciplined headcount process.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities.

Mark, so on Monday in your interview with Jensen, you said something along the lines of if scaling ended up stopping one day, you'd have five years of\nproduct work to do and ahead of you. So outside of agents or AI assistants, what other areas in AI are you thinking about or looking at in that five-year road map?\nAnd then the second question is maybe one more stab at the capacity question. You guys said that Llama 3.1 was trained on 16,000 H100s. You've also said that\nyou're going to have 600,000 available by year-end. So even if we kind of go up to 160,000 GPUs for Llama 4, we have plenty of extra capacity for inference and\nfuture products. I guess how are you guys modeling out this entire kind of CapEx road map between training, inference, and future things? That's all. Thanks a\nlot. Thank you. We are clearly in the process of building out a lot of capacity, and Mark has alluded to that in his comments about what we have needed to train prior\ngenerations and the next generation of Llama. And we are -- and that's driving sort of what we've talked about in terms of the significant growth in CapEx in 2025.\nAnd we aren't really in the position now to share a longer-term outlook. When we think about sort of any given new data center project that we are constructing,\nwe think about how we will use it over the life of the data center. We think about the amount of capacity we would use in terms of training whatever the\nsubsequent generations of Llama are and it is architected around that. But then we also look at how we might use it several years into its lifetime towards other\nuse cases across our core business, across what we think might be future needs for inference, for generative AI-based products. So there is sort of a whole host\nof use cases for the life of any individual data center ranging from gen AI training at its outset to potentially supporting gen AI inference to being used for core ads\nand content ranking and recommendation and also thinking through the implications, too, of what kinds of servers we might use to support those different types of\nuse cases. So we are really mapping across a wide range of potential use cases when we undertake any given project. And we are really doing that with both a\nlong time horizon in mind, again, because of the long lead times in spinning up data centers, but also recognizing that there are multiple decision points in the\nlifetime of each data center in terms of thinking through when to order servers and what servers to order and what you will put them towards. And that gives us\nflexibility to make the sort of the best decisions based on the information we have in the future.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:59Z"}
