{"doc_id": "MSFT_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q2", "ticker": "MSFT", "quarter": "Q2", "filing_date": "2025-06-01", "phase": "qa", "speaker_name": "Satya Nadella", "speaker_role": "CEO", "speaker_firm": null, "utterance_id": "u_0001", "utterance_type": "answer", "text": "Thank you, Brett. This quarter we saw continued strength in Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $40 billion in revenue for the first time, up 21% year-over-year. \nEnterprises are beginning to move from proof-of-concepts to enterprise-wide deployments to unlock the full ROI of AI. And our AI business has now surpassed an \nannual revenue run rate of $13 billion up 175% year-over-year. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I want to comment on the core thesis behind our \napproach to how we manage our fleet and how we allocate our capital to compute. AI scaling laws are continuing to compound across both pre-training and \ninference time compute. We ourselves have been seeing significant efficiency gains in both training and inference for years now. On inference, we have typically \nseen more than 2x price performance gain for every hardware generation and more than 10x for every model generation due to software optimizations. And as AI \nbecomes more efficient and accessible, we will see exponentially more demand. Therefore, much as we have done with the Commercial Cloud, we are focused \non continuously scaling our fleet globally and maintaining the right balance across training and inference as well as geo distribution. From now on it's a more \ncontinuous cycle governed by both revenue growth and capability growth, thanks to the compounding effects of software driven AI scaling laws and Moore's Law. \nWith that, I will walk through the progress we are making across every layer of the tech stack. Azure is the infrastructure layer for AI. We continue to expand our \ndata center capacity in line with both near-term and long-term demand signals. We have more than doubled our overall data center capacity in the last three \nyears and we have added more capacity last year than any other year in our history. Our data centers, networks, racks and silicon are all coming together as a \ncomplete system to drive new efficiencies to power both the cloud workloads of today and the next generation AI workloads. We continue to take advantage of \nMoore's Law and refresh our fleet as evidenced by our support of the latest from AMD, Intel, NVIDIA as well as our first-party silicon innovation from Maia, Cobalt, \nBoost and HSM. When it comes to cloud migrations, we continue to see customers like UBS move workloads to Azure. UBS alone migrated mainframe workloads \nencompassing nearly 400 billion records and 2 petabytes of data. And we remain the cloud of choice for customers' mission-critical Oracle, SAP and VMware \napps. At the data layer, we are seeing Microsoft Fabric breakout. We now have over 19,000 paid customers from Hitachi to Johnson Controls to Schaeffler. \nFabric is now the fastest growing analytics product in our history. Power BI is also deeply integrated with Fabric with over 30 million monthly active users, up 40% \nsince last year. Beyond Fabric, we are seeing new AI-driven data patterns emerge. If you look underneath ChatGPT or Copilot or Enterprise AI apps, you see the \ngrowth of raw storage, database services and app platform services as these workloads scale. The number of Azure OpenAI apps running on Azure databases \nand Azure app services more than doubled year-over-year driving significant growth and adoption across SQL Hyperscale and Cosmos DB. Now on to AI \nplatform and tools, as we shared last week we are thrilled OpenAI has made a new large Azure commitment. Through our strategic partnership we continue to \nbenefit mutually from each other's growth and with OpenAI's APIs exclusively running on Azure customers can count on us to get access to the world's leading \nmodels and OpenAI has a lot more coming soon, so stay tuned. Azure AI Foundry features best-in-class tooling, run times to build agents, multi-agent apps, AI \nops, API access to thousands of models. Two months in, we already have more than 200,000 monthly active users and we are well positioned with our support of \nboth OpenAI's leading models and the best selection of Open Source models and SLMs. DeepSeek's R1 launched today via the model catalog on Foundry and \nGitHub with automated red teaming, content safety integration and security scanning. Our Phi family of SLMs has now been downloaded over 20 million times \nand we also have more than 30 models from partners like Bayer, Paige.AI, Rockwell Automation, Siemens to address industry specific use cases. With AI, how \nwe build, deploy and maintain code is fundamentally changing. And GitHub Copilot is increasingly the tool of choice for both digital natives like ASOS and Spotify \nas well as world's largest enterprises like HP, HSBC and KPMG. We've been delighted by the early response to GitHub Copilot and VS Code with more than a \nmillion sign ups in just the first week post launch. All up GitHub now is home to 150 million developers up 50% over the past two years. Now on to the future of \nwork. Microsoft 365 Copilot is the UI for AI. It helps supercharge employee productivity and provides access to a swarm of intelligent agents to streamline \nemployee workflow. We are seeing accelerated customer adoption across all deal sizes as we win new Microsoft 365 Copilot customers and see the majority of \nexisting enterprise customers come back to purchase more seats. When you look at customers who purchased Copilot during the first quarter of availability, they \nhave expanded their seats collectively by more than 10x over the past 18 months. To share just one example, Novartis has added thousands of seats each \nquarter over the past year and now have 40,000 seats. Barclays, Carrier Group, Pearson and University of Miami all purchased 10,000 or more seats this quarter. \nAnd overall the number of people who use Copilot daily again more than doubled quarter-over-quarter. Employees are also engaging with Copilot more than ever.\n\nUsage intensity increased more than 60% quarter-over-quarter and we are expanding our TAM with Copilot Chat which was announced earlier this month. Copilot\nChat along with Copilot Studio is now available to every employee to start using agents right in the flow of work. With Copilot Studio, we are making it as simple to\nbuild an agent as it is to create an Excel spreadsheet. More than 160,000 organizations have already used Copilot Studio and they collectively created more than\n400,000 custom agents in the last three months alone up over 2x quarter-over-quarter. We've also introduced our own first-party agents to facilitate meetings,\nmanage projects, resolve common HR and IT queries and access SharePoint data. And we also continue to see partners like Adobe, SAP, ServiceNow and\nWorkday build their third-party agents and integrate with Copilot. What is driving Copilot as the UI for AI as well as our momentum with agents is our rich data\ncloud which is the world's largest source of organizational knowledge. Billions of emails, documents and chats, hundreds of millions of teams meetings and\nmillions of SharePoint sites are added each day. This is the Enterprise Knowledge Cloud. It is growing fast up over 25% year-over-year. More broadly what we\nare seeing is Copilot plus agents disrupting business applications and we are leaning into this. With Dynamics 365, we took share as organizations like Ecolab,\nLenovo, RTX, Total Energies, and Vizient switched to our AI powered apps from legacy providers. In Healthcare, DAX Copilot surpassed 2 million monthly\nphysician patient encounters up 54% quarter-over-quarter. It is being used by top providers like Mass General Brigham, Michigan Medicine, Vanderbilt University\nMedical Center to increase productivity of their physicians. When it comes to Windows, we are seeing momentum build as we approach end of support for\nWindows 10. Customers are choosing the latest Windows 11 devices for their enhanced security and advanced AI capabilities. 15% of premium priced laptops in\nthe US this holiday were Copilot+ PCs and we expect the majority of the PCs sold in the next several years to be Copilot+ PCs. We also see more and more\ndevelopments from Adobe and CapCut to WhatsApp build apps that leverage built-in NPUs. And they will soon be able to run DeepSeek's R1 distilled models\nlocally on Copilot+ PCs as well as the vast ecosystem of GPUs available on Windows. And beyond Copilot+ PCs the most powerful AI workstation for local\ndevelopment is a Windows PC running WSL 2 powered by NVIDIA RTX GPUs. Now on to Security. We continue to make progress with our Secure Future\ninitiative and we are applying what we have learned introducing over 80 new product capabilities over the past year. With Security Copilot organizations across\nprivate and public sector like City of Johannesburg, Eastman, Intesa, National Australia Bank, NTT can resolve incidents 30% faster. Data governance is\nincreasingly critical and customers now use Microsoft Purview to audit over 2 billion Copilot interactions for safe and compliant use. Now on to our consumer\nbusinesses starting with LinkedIn. More professionals than ever are engaging in high value conversations on LinkedIn with comments up 37% year-over-year.\nShort form video continues to grow on the platform with video creation all up growing at twice the rate of other post formats. We're also innovating with agents to\nhelp recruiters and small businesses find qualified candidates faster and our hiring business again took share. In subscriptions, LinkedIn premiums surpassed $2\nbillion in annual revenue for the first time this quarter. Subscriber growth has increased nearly 50% over the past two years and nearly 40% of subscribers have\nused our AI features to improve their profiles. And LinkedIn marketing solution remains the leader in B2B advertising. Now on to Search Advertising and News.\nWe once again took share across Bing and Edge. Edge surpassed 30% market share in the US on Windows and has taken share for 15 consecutive quarters.\nThe investments we have made in improving our ad rates are paying off and advertisers increasingly see our network as an essential platform to optimize ROI.\nAnd our Copilot consumer app is seeing increased engagement and retention with its improved speed, unique personality, first of its kind features like Copilot\nVision. Just today we made Think Deeper powered by o1, free for all Copilot users globally. Now on to gaming, we are focused on improving the profitability of the\nbusiness in order to position it for long-term growth driven by higher margin content and platform services and we are delivering on this plan. Black Ops 6 was top\nselling game on Xbox and PlayStation this quarter and saw more players in its launch quarter than any other paid release in the franchise history. And we saw\nrave reviews of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle which has already been played by more than 4 million people. We also continue to see strong momentum for\nXbox Cloud Gaming with a record 140 million hours streamed this quarter. All-up Game Pass set a new quarterly record for revenue and grew its PC subscriber\nbase by over 30% as we focus on driving fully paid subscribers across endpoints. In closing, we continue to innovate across our tech stack to help our customers\nin this AI era and I'm energized by the many opportunities ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.", "char_count": 11267, "word_count": 1854, "token_count": 2326, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "MSFT_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q2_u_0001", "company": "MSFT", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2025, "period": "2025-Q2", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/MSFT/MSFT_FY2025_Q2.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

This quarter revenue was $69.6 billion up 12%. Gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant \ncurrency, while operating income increased 17% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $3.23 an increase of 10%. We delivered another quarter \nof double-digit top and bottom line growth. Results were driven by strong demand for our cloud and AI offerings, while we also improved our operating leverage \nwith higher than expected operating income growth. As you heard from Satya, our AI business annual revenue run rate surpassed $13 billion and was above \nexpectations. Commercial bookings increased 67% and 75% in constant currency and were significantly ahead of expectations driven by Azure commitments \nfrom OpenAI. Execution was strong across our core annuity sales motions with growth in the number of $100 million plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft \n365. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $298 billion, up 34% and 36% in constant currency. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue \nin the next 12 months, up 21% year-over-year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 45%. And this quarter, our annuity mix \nwas 97%. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, More Personal Computing \nrevenue, total company COGS, and operating expense. FX decreased revenue more than expected in our commercial segments. Microsoft Cloud revenue was \n$40.9 billion and grew 21%. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 70%, in line with expectations and decreased two points year-over-year driven by \nscaling our AI infrastructure. Company gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to 69% primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher margin \nbusinesses as well as improvement in Gaming and Search, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5%, lower \nthan expected, and operating margins increased two points year-over-year to 45%. The better than expected margin expansion was driven by delivering \nefficiencies across our businesses as we invest to scale AI infrastructure and build AI applications. At a total company level, headcount at the end of December \nwas 2% higher than a year ago and was relatively unchanged from last quarter. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes \nwas $29.4 billion and grew 14% and 13% in constant currency even with the unfavorable FX impact noted earlier. Results were ahead of expectations driven by \nMicrosoft 365 Commercial. Microsoft 365 Commercial Cloud revenue increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations due to better \nthan expected performance in E5 and Microsoft 365 Copilot. With M365 Copilot, we continue to see growth in adoption, expansion, and usage. ARPU growth was \nagain driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. Paid M365 Commercial seats grew 7% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments, though \nprimarily in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 commercial products revenue increased 13%, significantly ahead of expectations \ndriven by higher than expected transactional purchasing with the launch of Office 2024 as well as the Windows Commercial on-premises components from the \nbetter than expected performance of M365 suites noted earlier. M365 Consumer Cloud revenue increased 8%, slightly ahead of expectations. We saw continued \nmomentum in M365 consumer subscriptions which grew 10% to 86.3 million with mix shift to M365 Basic. LinkedIn revenue increased 9% with continued growth \nacross all lines of business. In our Talent Solutions business, results were slightly below expectations driven by continued weakness in the hiring market in key \nverticals. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 19% and 18% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations with growth across all workloads. Segment gross \nmargin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year driven by scaling our AI \ninfrastructure. Operating expenses increased 6% and operating income increased 16% and 15% in constant currency. Next the Intelligent Cloud segment. \nRevenue was $25.5 billion and grew 19% with more unfavorable FX impact than expected. Excluding the unfavorable FX impact, results in Azure non-AI services, \non-prem server, and enterprise and partner services were slightly lower than expected, partially offset by better than expected results in Azure AI services. Azure \nand other cloud services revenue grew 31%. Azure growth included 13 points from AI services, which grew 157% year-over-year and was ahead of expectations\n\neven as demand continued to be higher than our available capacity. Growth in our non-AI services was slightly lower than expected due to go-to-market \nexecution challenges, particularly with our customers that we primarily reach through our scale motions, as we balance driving near-term non-AI consumption with \nAI growth. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 3%, slightly below expectations driven by slower than expected purchasing around Windows \nServer 2025 launch. Enterprise and Partner Services revenue decreased 1%, below expectations with lower than expected performance across Enterprise \nSupport Services and Industry Solutions. Segment gross margin dollars increased 12% and 13% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased \nfour points year-over-year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 10% and operating income grew 14%. Now to More Personal \nComputing. Revenue was $14.7 billion, relatively unchanged year-over-year with better than expected results driven primarily by Windows OEM pre-builds, usage \nfrom a third-party partnership in Search, as well as Call of Duty launch performance in Gaming. Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 4% \nyear-over-year, ahead of expectations, driven by commercial inventory builds in advance of Windows 10 end of support as well as uncertainty around tariffs. \nSearch and News advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 21% and 20% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by usage from a third-party \npartnership. Growth continues to be driven by rate expansion and healthy volume growth in both Edge and Bing. And in Gaming, revenue decreased 7% and 8% \nin constant currency as content and services growth continued to be offset by hardware declines. Xbox content and services revenue increased 2%, ahead of \nexpectations driven by stronger than expected performance in Blizzard and Activision content, including Call of Duty. Segment gross margin dollars increased \n13% and 12% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased six points year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses as well as \nstrong execution on margin improvement in Gaming and Search. Operating expenses decreased 1%. Operating income increased 32% and 30% in constant \ncurrency driven by continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were \n$22.6 billion, in line with expectations, and cash paid for PP&E was $15.8 billion. More than half of our cloud and AI related spend was on long-lived assets that \nwill support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud and AI spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve \ncustomers based on demand signals including our customer contracted backlog. Cash flow from operations was $22.3 billion, up 18% driven by strong cloud \nbillings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier, employee and tax payments. Free cash flow was $6.5 billion, down 29% year-over-year, reflecting the \ncapital expenditures noted earlier. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $2.3 billion, lower than our October guidance due to the impairment \ncharge from our Cruise investment. Our effective tax rate came in slightly lower than anticipated at 18%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders \nthrough dividends and share repurchases. Now, moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. First, FX. With the \nstrengthening of the US dollar since October, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by two points. Within the segments, we expect FX to decrease \nrevenue growth by two points in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and roughly one point in More Personal Computing. When compared \nto our October guidance assumptions on Q3 FX impact, this is a decrease to total revenue of roughly $1 billion. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by \napproximately two points and operating expense growth by approximately one point. Our outlook has many of the trends we saw in Q2 continue through Q3. \nDemand for our differentiated cloud and AI offerings across the Microsoft Cloud should drive another quarter of strong growth. In Commercial Bookings, with a \nrelatively flat expiry base and a strong prior year comparable in terms of large Azure contracts, we expect growth to be roughly flat year-over-year. We expect \nconsistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued long-term commitments to our platform. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure \ncontracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin \npercentage should be roughly 69%, down year-over-year driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and \nBusiness Processes we expect revenue to grow between 11% and 12% in constant currency or $29.4 billion to $29.7 billion. Microsoft 365 Commercial Cloud \nrevenue growth should be between 14% and 15% in constant currency, relatively stable compared to our better than expected Q2 results. We expect continued \nARPU growth through E5 and M365 Copilot and we again expect some seat growth moderation given the size of the installed base. For M365 Commercial \nproducts, we expect revenue to be relatively unchanged year-over-year. As a reminder, M365 Commercial products include Windows Commercial on-premises \ncomponents of M365 suites, so our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. \nM365 Consumer Cloud revenue growth should be in the mid to high-single-digits driven by M365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the \nlow to mid-single-digits. Although we expect growth across all businesses, the Q2 trends in Talent Solutions should continue in Q3 as a headwind to growth. And \nin Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid-teens driven by continued growth across all workloads. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to \ngrow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or $25.9 billion to $26.2 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have \nquarterly variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth to be between 31% \nand 32% in constant currency driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services. As we shared in October, the contribution from our AI services will grow from \nincreased AI capacity coming online. In non-AI services healthy growth continues, although we expect ongoing impact through H2 as we work to address the \nexecution challenges noted earlier. And while we expect to be AI capacity constrained in Q3, by the end of FY25 we should be roughly in line with near-term \ndemand given our significant capital investments. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-single-digits driven by a decrease \nin transactional purchasing. And in Enterprise and Partner services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single-digits. In More Personal Computing, \nwe expect revenue to be $12.4 billion to $12.8 billion with continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities. Windows OEM and Devices revenue should \ndecline in the low to mid-single-digits. We expect revenue from Windows OEM to be relatively flat year-over-year as our outlook assumes inventory levels will \nnormalize. Actual results may differ based on current tariff uncertainties. Devices revenue will decline. Search and News advertising ex-TAC revenue growth \nshould be in the mid-teens from continued growth in both volume and revenue per search with share gains across Edge and Bing. Growth is expected to \nmoderate from last quarter primarily due to additional FX impact and as the third-party partnership usage noted earlier returns to more normal levels. Search \nex-TAC growth will be higher than overall Search and News advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be in the mid to high-single-digits. And in Gaming, \nwe expect revenue growth to be in the low-single-digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single-digits driven by \nfirst-party content as well as Xbox Game Pass. Hardware revenue will decline year-over-year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow \nbetween 19% and 20% in constant currency or to be between $21.65 billion to $21.85 billion and operating expense to grow between 5% and 6% in constant \ncurrency or to be between $16.4 billion and $16.5 billion. Other income and expense is expected to be roughly negative $1 billion primarily driven by investments \naccounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. And lastly, we expect \nour Q3 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Now some additional thoughts on the rest of the fiscal year and beyond. First, FX. With the strengthening of \nthe US dollar since October, we now expect FX to decrease Q4 revenue and COGS growth by more than one point and operating expense growth by roughly one \npoint. Next, capital expenditures. We expect quarterly spend in Q3 and Q4 to remain at similar levels as our Q2 spend. In FY26, we expect to continue investing \nagainst strong demand signals including customer contracted backlog we need to deliver against across the entirety of our Microsoft Cloud. However, the growth \nrate will be lower than FY25 and the mix of spend will begin to shift back to short-lived assets which are more correlated to revenue growth. As a reminder, our \nlong-lived infrastructure investments are fungible, enabling us to remain agile as we meet customer demand globally across our Microsoft Cloud including AI \nworkloads. As always, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. For the full fiscal \nyear, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth as we focus on delivering efficiencies across both COGS and operating expense. \nAnd given the operating leverage that we've delivered throughout the year, inclusive of efficiency gains as we scale our AI infrastructure and utilize our own AI \nsolutions, we now expect FY25 operating margins to be up slightly year-over-year. And finally, our FY25 full year effective tax rate should be between 18% and \n19%. In closing, we are committed to delivering real world AI solutions that help customers grow and improve their results. We are confident in our leadership\n\nposition as we grow with our customers.

Let me spend a little time on that about what we saw in Q2 and give you some additional background on the near-term execution issues that we're\ntalking about. First, let me be very specific. They are in the non-AI ACR component. Our Azure AI results were better than we thought due to very good work by\nthe operating teams pulling in some delivery dates even by weeks. When your capacity constrained weeks matter, and it was good execution by the team, and\nyou see that in the revenue results. On the non-AI side, really, the challenges were in what we call the scale motion. So think about primarily these are customers\nwe reach through partners and through more indirect methods of selling. And really, the art form there is as these customers, which we reach in this way, are\ntrying to balance how do you do an AI workload with continuing some of the work they've done on migrations and other fundamentals, we then took our sales\nmotions in the summer and really change to try to balance those two. As you do that, you learn with your customers and with your partners on sort of getting that\nbalance right between where to put our investments, where to put the marketing dollars and importantly, where to put people in terms of coverage and being able\nto help customers make those transitions. And I think we are going to make some adjustments to make sure we are in balance because when you make those\nchanges in the summer, by the time it works its way through the system, you can see the impacts on whether you have that balance right. And so the teams are\nworking through that. They're already making adjustments. And I expect, while, we will see some impact through H2 just because when you work through the\nscale motion, it can take some time for that to adjust. I feel good that the teams understand and are working through that. So hopefully that's just helpful on that.\nThen we talked a little bit about Q3. And so we've talked about 31% to 32% after publishing a 31% this quarter. Our AI results that we had felt good about and\ntalked about our ability to land that revenue is the same. So again, in Q3, we are working from a pretty constrained capacity place. And that's no different than it\nwas our expectation to be in that position last October when I talked to you all. And when I talk about being at a capacity constraint, it takes two things. You have\nto have space, which I generally call long-lived assets, right, that's the infrastructure and the land and then you have to have kits. We're continuing and you've\nseen that's why our spend has pivoted this way to be in the long-lived investment. We have been short, power and space. And so as you see those investments\nland that we've made over the past three years, we get closer to that balance by the end of this year. And so the confidence on the AI side continues to be there\nin terms of being able to sell, utilize and be, I think, encouraged by the signals. What we're seeing is waiting to see just how the non-AI ACR works through the\nscale motions in H2. But in general, the only thing that's changed is really that scale motion from my seat, Keith.

Thanks, Brent. So, yes, in my remarks, I talked about how in some sense, what's happening with AI is no different than what was happening with the regular\ncompute cycle. It's always about bending the curve and then putting more points up the curve. So there's Moore's Law that's working in hyperdrive. Then on top\nof that, there is the AI scaling laws, both the pre-training and the inference time compute that compound and that's all software. You should think of what I said in\nmy remarks, which we have observed for a while, which is 10x on improvements per cycle just because of all the software optimizations on inference. And so\nthat's what you see. And then to that, I think DeepSeek has had some real innovations. And that is some of the things that even OpenAI found in o1. And so we\nare going to, obviously, now that all gets commoditized, and it's going to get broadly used. And the big beneficiaries of any software cycle like that is the\ncustomers, right. Because at the end of the day, if you think about it, right, what was the big lesson learned from client server to cloud, more people bought\nservers except it was called cloud. And so when token prices fall, infants computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there'll be more apps\nwritten. And it's interesting to see that when I referenced these models that are pretty powerful, it's unimaginable to think that here we are in sort of beginning of\n'25 where on the PC, you can run a model that required pretty massive cloud infrastructure.

Thanks for the question. So we remain very happy with the partnership with OpenAI.

And \nobviously, their success is our success because even all the other commercial arrangements that we detailed out in the blog that we put out even commensurate \nwith that announcement. But to your overall point, the thing that I would say is we are building a pretty fungible fleet, right. We're making sure that there's the right \nbalance between training and inference. It's geo distributed. We are working super hard on all the software oppositions, right. I mean just not the software \noptimizations that come because of what DeepSeek has done, but all the work we have done to, for example, reduce the prices of GPT models, over the years in \npartnership with OpenAI. In fact, we did a lot of the work on the inference optimizations on it and that's been key to driving, right. One of the key things to note in \nAI is you just don't launch the frontier model, but if it's too expensive to serve, it's no good, right. It won't generate any demand. So you've got to have that \noptimization, so that inferencing costs are coming down and they can be consumed broadly. And so that's the fleet physics we are managing. And also,\n\nremember, you don't want to buy too much of anything at one time because the Moore's Law every year is going to give you 2x, your optimization is going to give\nyou 10x. You want to continuously upgrade the fleet, modernize the fleet, age, the fleet, and at the end of the day, have the right ratio of monetization and\ndemand-driven monetization to what you think of as the training expense.

We have and I think we talked about it, close to $300 billion of RPO, that is committed customer contracts that need to be delivered on. And\nthe faster we can do that and the more efficiently we can do that, the better off we are not just the OpenAI partnership, which is a piece of that, but with the entire\nplatform that we need to deliver for our customers. And I think the other thing that's sometimes missing is when we say fungible, we mean not just the primary\nuse, which we've always talked about, which is inference, but there is some training, post training, which is a key component. And then they're just running the\ncommercial hub, which at every layer under at every modern AI app that's going to be built, it will be required. It will be required to be distributed, and it will be\nrequired to be global. And all of those things are really important because it then means you're the most efficient. And so the investment you see us making\nCapEx.

Some of them are models that you distill into an open source model. So there's going to be a combination. So we've always maintained that it's always \ngood to have frontier models. You want to always build your application with high ambition using the best model that is available and then optimize from there on.\n\nSo that's also another side like there's a temporality to it, right. What you start with as a given COGS profile doesn't need to be the end because you continuously\noptimize for latency and COGS and putting in different mode. And in fact, all that complexity, by the way, has to be managed by a new app server. So one of the\nthings that we are investing heavily on is foundry because from an app developer perspective, you kind of want to keep pace with the flurry of models that are\ncoming in and you want to have an evergreen way for your application to benefit from all that innovation. But not have all the Dev cost or the DevOps cost or what\npeople talk about AIOps costs.

And I think that's important. We also had a good E5 quarter, which when we talk a lot about M365 Copilot, I\nsometimes forget to also talk about suite momentum.

One, it's existing customers who've worked through their commitments and are making larger commitments, which is a good\ncommitment signed for the platform.
