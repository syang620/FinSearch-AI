It was a record quarter, driven by continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $42 billion in revenue, up 22% in constant \ncurrency. Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs, and accelerate growth. Now, I will highlight examples, starting \nwith infrastructure. We continue to expand our data center capacity. This quarter alone, we opened DCs in 10 countries across four continents. Model capabilities \nare doubling in performance every six months, thanks to multiple, compounding scaling laws. We continue to optimize and drive efficiencies across every layer \u2013 \nfrom DC design, to hardware and silicon, to systems software, to model optimization \u2013 all towards lowering costs and increasing performance. You see this in our \nsupply chain, where we have reduced dock-to-lead times for new GPUs by nearly 20%. Across our blended fleet, where we have increased AI performance by \nnearly 30% ISO power. And, our cost per token, which has more than halved. When it comes to cloud migrations, we saw accelerating demand, with customers in \nevery industry, from Abercrombie & Fitch Co., to Coca-Cola and ServiceNow, expanding their footprints on Azure. And we remain the cloud of choice for \ncustomers\u2019 mission critical VMWare, SAP, and Oracle workloads, with more regional availability than any other hyperscaler. We are also excited about the next \nfrontier in cloud systems with quantum. In addition to putting our quantum stack on machines from our partners, we are also making real progress on a path to a \nutility scale quantum computer with the introduction of Majorana-1. When it comes to data and analytics, we have deeply integrated our AI platform with our data \nstack. PostgreSQL usage accelerated for the third consecutive quarter, and it is now used by nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 including companies like BMW and \nBNY Mellon. Cosmos DB revenue growth also accelerated again this quarter and remains the go-to database for globally distributed NoSQL workloads at any \nscale. It is used by customers in every industry like CarMax, DocuSign, NTT Data, and OpenAI. This quarter, we also saw analytics consumption accelerate. \nMicrosoft Fabric has more than 21,000 paid customers, up 80% year-over-year. Fabric brings together data workloads like data warehousing, data science, \nreal-time intelligence, along with Power BI, into one end-to-end solution. Real-time intelligence is now the fastest growing workload in Fabric, with 40% of \ncustomers already using it just five months since becoming generally available. All up, more than 50% of Fabric customers \u2013 like Amore Pacific, Louisiana state \ngovernment, and Petrobras \u2013 use three or more workloads. And the amount of data in our multi-cloud data lake OneLake has grown more than 6X over the past \nyear. Now, on to AI platforms and tools. Foundry is the agent and AI app factory. It is now used by developers at over 70,000 enterprises and digital natives \u2013 \nfrom Atomicwork, to Epic, Fujitsu, and Gainsight, to H&R Block and LG Electronics \u2013 to design, customize, and manage their AI apps and agents. We processed \nover 100 trillion tokens this quarter, up 5X year-over-year \u2013 including a record 50 trillion tokens last month alone. And four months in, over 10,000 organizations \nhave used our new Agent Service to build, deploy, and scale their agents. This quarter we also made a new suite of fine-tuning tools available to customers with \nindustry-leading reliability. And we brought the latest models from OpenAI, along with new models from Cohere, DeepSeek, Meta, Mistral, Stability to Foundry. \nAnd we have expanded our Phi family of SLMs with new multimodal and mini models. All up, Phi has been downloaded 38 million times. And our research teams \nare taking it one step further, with BitNet b1.58, a billion parameter large language model that can run on just CPUs, coming to the Foundry. Now, on to developer \ntools. We are evolving GitHub Copilot from pair to peer programmer. With agent mode in VS Code, Copilot can now iterate on code, recognize errors, and fix \nthem automatically. This adds to other Copilot agents like Autofix, which helps developers remediate vulnerabilities, as well as Code Review Agent, which has \nalready reviewed over 8 million pull requests. And we are previewing a first-of-its-kind SWE agent capable of asynchronously executing developer tasks. All-up, \nwe now have over 15 million GitHub Copilot users, up over 4X year-over-year. And both digital natives like Twilio and enterprises like Cisco, HPE, SkyScanner, \nand Target, continue to choose GitHub Copilot to equip their developers with AI throughout the entire dev lifecycle. With Visual Studio and VS Code, we have the \nworld\u2019s most popular editor, with over 50 million monthly active users. And with Power Platform we have the leading low code platform for AI makers too. We now \nhave 56 million monthly active Power Platform users, up 27% year-over-year, who increasingly use our AI features to build apps and automate processes. Now, \non to the future of work. Microsoft 365 Copilot is built to facilitate human-agent collaboration. Hundreds of thousands of customers across geographies and \nindustries now use Copilot, up 3X year-over-year. Our overall deal size continues to grow, and this quarter, we saw a record number of customers returning to \nbuy more seats. And we are going further. Just last week, we announced a major update, bringing together agents, notebooks, search, and create into a new \nscaffolding for work. Our new Researcher and Analyst deep reasoning agents analyze vast amounts of web and enterprise data to deliver highly-skilled expertise \non demand directly within Copilot. Beyond horizontal knowledge work, we are introducing agents for every role and business process. Our Sales Agent turns\n\ncontacts into qualified leads, and with Sales Chat reps can quickly get up to speed on new accounts. And our Customer Service Agent is deflecting customer\ninquiries and helping service reps resolve issues faster. With Copilot Studio, customers can extend Copilot and build their own agents with no-code/low code.\nMore than 230,000 organizations \u2013 including 90% of the Fortune 500 \u2013 have already used Copilot Studio. With deep reasoning and agent flows in Copilot Studio,\ncustomers can build agents that perform more complex tasks, and also handle deterministic scenarios like document processing and financial approvals. And\nthey can now build \u201ccomputer use\u201d agents that take action on the UI across desktop and web apps. And, with just a click, they can turn any SharePoint site into\nan agent too. This quarter alone, customers created over 1 million custom agents across SharePoint and Copilot Studio, up 130% quarter-over-quarter. When it\ncomes to business applications, Dynamics 365 again took share as companies like Avaya, Brunswick, SoftCat, switched to Dynamics from legacy providers.\nVerizon, for example, chose Dynamics 365 Sales to improve the efficiency of its sellers. In healthcare, Dragon Copilot is off to a fast start. Last quarter alone, we\nhelped document nearly 9.5 million physician-patient encounters at providers like City of Hope, Ottawa Hospital, Tufts Medicine and WellStar, up over 50%\nquarter-over-quarter. In manufacturing, we introduced Factory Operations and Safety Agents at Hannover Messe. And leading partners like Autodesk, PTC, and\nSiemens have all built their own industrial AI solutions on our stack. And, in retail, we have introduced agents to help customers like Bath & Body Works build\nmore personalized shopping experiences and improve store operations. When it comes to Windows, Copilot+ PCs are faster and have better battery life than\nother devices in their category. We also continue to win new customers with best-in-class AI capabilities. We offer a growing number of AI apps from partners like\nAdobe, Canva, and Zoom. Just last week, we rolled out exclusive AI experiences like Recall, Click to Do, and Windows Search, to all Copilot+ PCs. And we\ncontinue to see increased commercial traction as we approach end-of-support for Windows 10. Windows 11 commercial deployments increased nearly 75%\nyear-over-year. Now, on to security. Security is our top priority, and we have made significant progress against the engineering objectives we outlined a year and\na half ago as part of our Secure Future Initiative. We are now applying these learnings to deliver new innovation across our platform. Last month, along with our\npartners, we introduced Security Copilot agents to help defenders autonomously handle high-volume security and IT tasks, informed by 84 trillion daily threat\nsignals. We also added new capabilities to Defender, Entra, and Purview to help organizations secure and govern their AI deployments. All up, we now have 1.4\nmillion security customers. Over 900,000 \u2013 including EY Global, Manpower Group, TriNet, Regions Bank \u2013 have 4 or more workloads, up 21% year-over-year.\nAnd, in identity, Entra now has more than 900 million monthly active users. Now, on to our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn. Over one billion\nprofessionals use LinkedIn to connect, learn, hire, and sell \u2013 and our membership continues to grow at double digits year-over-year. Time spent watching videos\non the platform was up 36%, and comments were up 32% year-over-year. We are also seeing more members use AI to gain new skills and find jobs. The number\nof learners who have used AI-powered coaching increased over 2X quarter-over-quarter. And we remain the market leader in hiring, as customers like Equinix\nand Verizon use LinkedIn Hiring Assistant to find qualified candidates faster. When it comes to LinkedIn Premium, we saw over 75% quarter-over-quarter\nsubscriber growth to our Premium Pages offering for SMBs. And LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be the best way to reach B2B decision makers, with\ntwo consecutive quarters of accelerated revenue growth. More broadly, when it comes to advertising, we are transforming how people search, browse, discover\ncontent, and use AI as a personal assistant. With Copilot Search in Bing, we are reimagining search results with overview pages curated by AI, and embedded\nconversational capabilities. With Copilot Vision in Edge, Copilot sees what you see and gives you real-time responses while you browse. With Copilot Discover,\nwe are personalizing the MSN experience, based on user interactions and preferences. And with our updated Copilot app, we are focused on building daily\nengagement and successful sessions across a range of modalities, whether it is conversing, searching, shopping, or travel planning. All up, we again took share\nacross Bing and Edge. And our total advertising revenue across our businesses has surpassed $20 billion over the last 12 months. Now, on to gaming. We\ncontinue to transform the business and focus on margin expansion, as we bring our games to over 500 million monthly active users across devices. We ended\nthe quarter as the top publisher by pre-orders and pre-installs on both Xbox and the PlayStation Store. PC Game Pass revenue increased over 45%\nyear-over-year. With Xbox Play Anywhere, players now can access more than 1,000 games they can play across console and PC. And just last week we brought\ncloud gaming to LG TVs. Cloud gaming set a new record, surpassing 150 million hours played for the first time this quarter. We are also integrating AI across\nXbox. New Copilot for Gaming is a personalized gaming companion that provides in-game assistance and expert coaching. And our first of its kind Muse model\ncan generate gameplay in real-time. Finally, it is fantastic to see the success of Minecraft Movie which is the top grossing film of the year. In addition to\nmonetizing our IP in new ways, we have seen a 75 percent-plus increase in weekly active users of the game year-over-year since the release. In closing, we are\nrapidly innovating to expand our opportunity across both consumer and commercial businesses. In just a few weeks, at our Build conference, we will share how\nwe\u2019re creating the most powerful AI platform for developers\u2014and I encourage you to tune in.

This quarter, revenue was $70.1 billion, up 13% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased \n11% and 13% in constant currency while operating income increased 16% and 19% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $3.46, an increase of 18% \nand 19% in constant currency. Results exceeded expectations driven by focused execution from our sales and partner teams. We continue to see strong demand \nfor our cloud and AI offerings as they help customers drive productivity, increase efficiencies, and grow their businesses. And, again this quarter, revenue from \nour AI business was above expectations. Commercial bookings increased 18% and 17% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations again this \nquarter, driven by an Azure commitment from OpenAI. We also saw consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued long-term \ncommitments to our platform. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $315 billion, up 34% and 33% in constant currency. Roughly 40% will \nbe recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 17% year over year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 47%. And this \nquarter, our annuity mix was 98%. FX was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, and operating expense growth. FX \ndecreased COGS growth by only 1 point, 1 point unfavorable to expectations. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $42.4 billion, ahead of expectations, and grew 20% \nand 22% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 69%, in line with expectations, and decreased 3 points year over year driven by the \nimpact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Company gross margin percentage was also 69%, down 1 point year over year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. \nOperating expenses increased 2% and 3% in constant currency, lower than expected due to our focus on cost efficiencies as well as investments that shifted to \nQ4. Operating margins increased 1 point year over year to 46%, better than expected as we continue to focus on building high-performing teams and increasing \nour agility by reducing layers with fewer managers. At a total company level, headcount at the end of March was 2% higher than a year ago and was down slightly \ncompared to last quarter. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $29.9 billion and grew 10% and 13% in constant \ncurrency, ahead of expectations driven by LinkedIn, Microsoft 365 commercial products, and Microsoft 365 consumer. M365 commercial cloud revenue increased \n12% and 15% in constant currency, in line with expectations. ARPU growth was again driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. With M365 Copilot, we continue to see \ngrowth across customer segments and geos. Paid M365 commercial seats grew 7% year over year to over 430 million. While we continue to see installed base \nexpansion across all customer segments, growth was primarily driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 commercial \nproducts revenue increased 5% and 8% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to higher-than-expected Office transactional purchasing. M365 \nconsumer cloud revenue increased 10% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by higher-than-expected subscription growth following the \nJanuary price increase. M365 consumer subscriptions grew 9% to 87.7 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 7% and 8% in constant currency. Results were ahead \nof expectations due to better-than-expected performance across all businesses. The Talent Solutions business continues to be impacted by weakness in the \nhiring market. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 16% and 18% in constant currency, in line with expectations with continued growth across all workloads.\n\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 10% and 13% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year over year even with the\nimpact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 1% and 2% in constant currency and operating income increased 15% and 18% in constant\ncurrency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $26.8 billion and grew 21% and 22% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by Azure. In\nAzure and other cloud services, revenue grew 33% and 35% in constant currency including 16 points from AI services. Focused execution drove non-AI services\nresults where we saw accelerated growth in our enterprise customer segment as well as some improvement in our scale motions. And, in Azure AI services, we\nbrought capacity online faster than expected. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 6% and 4% in constant currency, slightly below\nexpectations driven by renewals with lower in-period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. The year over year decline is reflective of the continued\ncustomer shift to cloud offerings. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations due to\nbetter-than-expected performance in Enterprise Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 14% in constant currency and gross margin\npercentage decreased 4 points year over year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 6% and 7% in constant currency and\noperating income grew 17% and 18% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.4 billion and grew 6% and 7% in constant\ncurrency, ahead of expectations due to better-than-expected results across all businesses. Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 3% year over year,\nahead of expectations as tariff uncertainty through the quarter resulted in inventory levels that remained elevated. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC\nincreased 21% and 23% in constant currency. Results were significantly ahead of expectations driven by usage from a third-party partnership,\nbetter-than-expected rate expansion, and volume growth across Edge and Bing. And in Gaming, revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. Xbox\ncontent and services revenue increased 8% and 9% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by stronger-than-expected performance in third-party and\nfirst-party content. Segment gross margin dollars increased 9% and 11% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased 2 points year over year driven\nby strong execution on margin improvement in Search and Gaming. Operating expenses increased 1%. Operating income increased 21% and 23% in constant\ncurrency driven by continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were\n$21.4 billion, slightly lower than expected due to normal variability from the timing of delivery of data center leases. Cash paid for PP&E was $16.7 billion.\nRoughly half of our cloud and AI related spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud\nand AI spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customers based on demand signals including our customer contracted backlog of $315\nbillion. Cash flow from operations was $37 billion, up 16% driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher tax payments. And this quarter,\nfree cash flow was $20.3 billion. Other income and expense was negative $623 million, more favorable than anticipated primarily due to net gains on derivatives\nand investments. Our losses on investments accounted for under the equity method were slightly higher than expected. Our effective tax rate was approximately\n18%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, an increase of 15% year over year. Now, moving to our Q4\noutlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. First, thru April, demand signals across our commercial businesses as well as in\nLinkedIn, Gaming, and Search have remained consistent. Our outlook assumes those trends continue in Q4. If the environment changes, our results may be\nimpacted. In our Windows OEM business, our outlook assumes the elevated inventory levels from Q3 will come down in Q4. We have widened our guidance\nrange in our More Personal Computing segment to account for some of this variability. Next, FX. With the weakening of the US dollar in April, we now expect FX\nto increase total revenue growth by one point. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by one point in Productivity and Business\nProcesses and less than one point in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth by less\nthan one point. In commercial bookings, we expect solid growth on a significant prior year comparable and a growing expiry base. Bookings growth will be driven\nby strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued long-term commitments to our platform. As a reminder, larger longer-term Azure\ncontracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin\npercentage should be roughly 67%, down year over year primarily driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. And now, capital expenditures. We expect\nQ4 capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis. H2 capex in total remains unchanged from our January H2 guidance. As a reminder, there can be\nquarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure buildouts and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business\nProcesses we expect revenue of $32.05 to $32.35 billion, or growth of 11% to 12% in constant currency. M365 commercial cloud revenue growth should be\napproximately 14% in constant currency, relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. We expect continued ARPU growth thru E5 and M365 Copilot and some\nseat growth moderation given the size of the installed base. M365 commercial products revenue growth should be in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, M365\ncommercial products includes both the Windows Commercial on-premises components of M365 suites and Office transactional purchasing, both of which can be\nvariable due to in period revenue recognition dynamics. M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid-teens driven by the January price increase.\nFor LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid to high teens with continued\ngrowth across all workloads. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue of $28.75 to $29.05 billion or growth of 20% to 22% in constant currency. Revenue will\ncontinue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.", "char_count": 11017, "word_count": 1699, "token_count": 2279, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "MSFT_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q3_u_0002", "company": "MSFT", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2025, "period": "2025-Q3", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/MSFT/MSFT_FY2025_Q3.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

In our AI services, while we continue to bring datacenter capacity online as planned,\ndemand is growing a bit faster. Therefore, we now expect to have some AI capacity constraints beyond June. In our on-premises server business, we again\nexpect revenue to decline in the mid-single digits with the ongoing customer shift to cloud offerings. And in Enterprise and partner services, we expect revenue\ngrowth to be in the mid to high single digits driven by Enterprise Support Services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be $12.35 to $12.85\nbillion. Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the mid to high single digits. We expect Windows OEM revenue to decline in the low to mid-single\ndigits assuming OEM inventory levels come down thru the quarter as noted earlier, although the range of potential outcomes is wider than normal. Devices\nrevenue should decline in the high teens. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the high teens, even on a strong prior year\ncomparable. We expect to see continued growth in both volume and revenue per search with share gains across Edge and Bing. Overall Search and news\nadvertising revenue growth should be in the mid-teens. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. We expect Xbox content and\nservices revenue growth to be in the high single digits driven by first-party content. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $23.6 to $23.8 billion or\ngrowth of 19% to 20% in constant currency and operating expense of $18 to $18.1 billion or growth of approximately 5% in constant currency. Therefore, even\nwith ongoing AI investments as we scale, we continue to expect full-year FY25 operating margins to be up slightly year over year. Other income and expense is\nexpected to be roughly negative $1.2 billion primarily driven by investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize\nmark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. And lastly, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. Now I\u2019d like to share\nsome closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year. We remain committed to investing against the strong demand signals we see for our services. So, as a\nreminder, our earlier comments on FY26 capital expenditures remain unchanged. We expect capex to grow, it will grow at a lower rate than FY25 and will include\na greater mix of short-lived assets which are more directly correlated to revenue than long-lived assets. These investments, along with focused execution that\ndelivers near-term value to our customers, will ensure we continue to lead through the cloud and AI opportunity ahead.

First of all, thanks, Keith, for the questions. The reality is, we\u2019ve always been making adjustments to build, lease, what pace we build, all through the last\n10-15 years. It\u2019s just that you all pay a lot more attention to what we do quarter over quarter nowadays. Having said that, the key thing for us is to have our builds\nand lease be positioned for what is the workload growth of the future. That\u2019s what you have to go and seek to. There\u2019s a demand part to it. There is the shape of\nthe workload part to it, and there is a location part to it. You don\u2019t want to be upside-down on having one big data center in one region, when you have a global\ndemand footprint. You don\u2019t want to be upside-down when the shape of demand changes, because, after all, with essentially pre-training plus test time compute,\nthat\u2019s a big change in terms of how you think about even what is training. Forget inferencing. Fundamentally, given all of that, and then every time there\u2019s great\nMoore\u2019s Law, but remember, this is a compounding S-curve, which is, there\u2019s Moore\u2019s Law, there\u2019s system software, there\u2019s model architecture changes, there\u2019s\nthe app server efficiency. Given all of that, we just want to make sure we\u2019re building, accounting for the latest and greatest information we have on all of that. And\nthat\u2019s what you see reflected, and I feel very, very good about the pace. In fact, Amy just mentioned, we will be short power. And so, therefore, but it\u2019s not power.\nIt\u2019s not a blanket statement. I need power in specific places so that we can either lease or build at the pace at which we want.

Yeah, I sort of think about three big things that are happening in the cloud, all at parallel, and there is also a relationship between them. One is, I\u2019ll \njust say, the classic migration of whether it\u2019s SQL, Windows Server. And so, that\u2019s, again, got good steady state progress, because the reality is, I think \neveryone\u2019s now, perhaps there\u2019s another kick in the datacenter migrations, just because of the efficiency the cloud provides. That\u2019s one part. The second piece is \ngood data growth. You saw Postgres on Azure. I mean, forgetting SQL Server, Postgres on Azure is growing. Cosmos is growing, the analytic stuff I talked about \nwith Fabric. It\u2019s even the others, whether it is Databricks or even Snowflake on Azure are growing. We feel very good about Fabric growth and our data growth. \nThen the cloud-native growth, this is, again, before we even get to AI, some of the core compute consumption of cloud-native players is also very healthy. It was \nhealthy throughout the quarter. We projected to go moving forward as well. Then the thing to notice is the ratio, and I think we\u2019ve mentioned this multiple times \nbefore. If you look underneath even ChatGPT, in fact, that team does a fantastic job of thinking about not only their growth in terms of AI accelerators they need. \nThey use Cosmos DB. They use Postgres. They use core compute and storage. And so, there\u2019s even a ratio between any AI workload in terms of AI accelerator \nto others. Those are the four pockets, I would say, or four different trend lines, which all have a relationship with each other. And if I step back, and Amy and I talk \na lot about this, this time around, there\u2019s nothing certain for sure in the future, except for one thing, which is our largest business is our infrastructure business. \nAnd the good news here is the next big platform shift builds on that. It\u2019s not a complete rebuild, having gone through some of these platform shift, where you have \nto come out on the other side with a full rebuild. If there is good news here, it\u2019s that we have a good business in Azure that continues to grow, and the new\n\nplatform depends on that.

Think about the same levers, plus model\nefficiency, those compound. Now, the one thing that\u2019s a little different this time is just the pace. And so, when you\u2019re seeing that happen, pace in terms of\nefficiency time, but also pace in terms of the buildout, so it can mask some of the progress. But we are working hard across all of the teams, hardware, software,\neven the build teams, to get things in place as quickly as possible, dock to live times. All of that is improving, and all of that actually is benefiting us.

Let me, first of all, say I think we\u2019ve talked about this quite a bit. It\u2019s always a good chance to get to iterate this. It\u2019s getting harder and harder to\nseparate what an AI workload is from a non-AI workload. And we\u2019ve talked about it this way, I think, in most instances, to make sure people understood that when\nwe were accelerating all of our CapEx spend over the past two and a half or three years now, that people had confidence that we were turning that into revenue\nand product in a way that was transparent and that everyone could understand, really the goals that we had set for ourselves and for our partners and customers\nin terms of building product that turned to revenue. But if you take a step back from that, it\u2019s that these workloads are being built, GPUs, CPUs, storage, network,\nall the same things. And so, I think really what we\u2019re talking about is really how Satya talked about, in one of the earlier questions, we\u2019re seeing digital natives.\nDigital natives build workloads. They do AI work. They do non-AI work. Do they tend to do that work in the same cloud? Lots of times. Sometimes it\u2019s all in the\nsame place, not all the time. But that relationship gets stronger and stronger as people pivot to more of AI heavy workloads. And so, I think you\u2019re starting to see\nsome of that relationship. I think we\u2019ll continue to see that as AI workloads continue to get built and experimented with, and proof of concepts get expanded. And\nso, I think I mostly focus on the fact that together, we saw good performance in Q3 on Azure, Azure inclusive of both components, in terms of our execution, in\nterms of the field and partner teams, and backlog and conversion, and interesting workloads, and adding customer value, and solving real problems, and adding\nreal value.
