## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Mark Moerdler (Bernstein)**: Thank you very much. Congratulations on the strong quarter and thanks for letting me ask the question. Amy, you've discussed Azure being stable and you
deliver Azure growth stability, but if we drill in one layer, we see Azure AI [aiming] (ph) to become a bigger portion of the revenue. I understand that separating
what is directly AI revenue versus other IaaS, PaaS revenue that are leveraging well driven by AI is difficult, can you help me with two related questions?
Optimization has been stabilizing and at some point, it should be part of the revenue flow. How should we think about what happens then, do we see non-directly
AI consumption being flattish or do we see a rebound as the cloud shift continues and the need for data of inferencing grows? Second point. On AI, where are we
in the journey from training driving most of Azure AI usage to inferencing? When do you think we start to see pick-up in non-Microsoft inferencing kick in, when do
you think we could hit the point where inferencing is the bigger part of the driver? Thank you.

**Satya Nadella (CEO)**: You want me to go first and...

### Exchange 002

**Mark Moerdler (Bernstein)**: Perfect. Thank you very much for the deep answer.

**Brett Iversen (President)**: Thanks, Mark. Joe, next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.

### Exchange 003

**Brent Thill (Jefferies)**: Good afternoon. Amy, the margin improvement is pretty shocking to most considering the investments that you and Satya are putting into AI. I'm curious if you
could just walk through, how this is possible and what you're seeing so far in some of the costs that you're trying to manage as you scale up AI?

### Exchange 004

**Brent Thill (Jefferies)**: Thanks, Amy.

**Brett Iversen (President)**: Thanks, Brent. Joe next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.

### Exchange 005

**Kash Rangan (Goldman Sachs)**: Hi, thank you very much. A superb quarter of great improvements. Just one question for you Satya. Cloud computing changed the tech stack in ways that we
could not imagine 10 years back, the nature of the database layer, the operating system layer, every layer just changed dramatically. How do you foresee
generative AI changing the tech stack as we know it? Thank you so much.

**Satya Nadella (CEO)**: Yes, I think it's going to have a very foundational impact. In fact, you could say the core compute architecture itself changes, everything from power, power
density to the data center design, to what used to be the accelerator, now is the sort of the main CPU, so to speak, or the main compute unit. And so, I think in the
network, the memory architecture, all of it. So as the core computer architecture changes, I think every workload changes. And so yes, so there is a full, like, take
our data layer, the most exciting thing for me in the last year has been to see how our data layer has evolved to be built for AI, right? If you think about Fabric, one
of the genius of Fabric is to be able to say, let's separate out storage from the compute layer. In compute we'll have traditional SQL, we’ll have Spark. And by the
way, you can have an Azure AI job on top of the same data lake, so to speak, or the lakehouse pattern. And then the business model you can combine all of
those different compute. So that's the type of compute architecture. So it's sort of a -- so that's just one example. The tool stuff is changing. Office, I mean if you
think about what -- if I look at Copilot; Copilots extensibility with GPT, Copilot apps to the Copilot stack, that's another sort of part of what's happening to the tech
stack. So yes, I mean, definitely builds. I mean. I do believe, being in the cloud has been very helpful to build AI. But now, AI is just redefining what it means to
have, what the cloud looks like, both at the infrastructure level and the app model.

### Exchange 006

**Kash Rangan (Goldman Sachs)**: Terrific. Thank you so much.

**Brett Iversen (President)**: Thanks, Kash. Joe, our next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.

### Exchange 007

**Karl Keirstead (UBS)**: Thank you. I wanted to return to AI, the six point AI lift to Azure is just extraordinary. But I wanted to ask you about your progress in standing up the infrastructure
to meet that demand. If you feel like Microsoft is supply GPU-constrained. Is the success you've had maybe working through some of the scaling bottlenecks that
some of the other cloud infrastructure providers have talked about, a little bit maybe on the infrastructure scaling front might be interesting. Thank you.

**Brett Iversen (President)**: Thanks, Karl. Joe, next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.

### Exchange 008

**Brad Zelnick (Deutsche Bank)**: Great, thank you so much for taking the question. The early market feedback that we're all hearing on Microsoft 365 copilot is very powerful. Can you provide
more granularity on what you're seeing in terms of adoption trends versus perhaps other new product introductions in the past, what if anything is holding it back,
and how much of a priority is it to get it in the hands of customers? To what lengths might you go to incentivize just getting it out in the market? Thank you.

**Satya Nadella (CEO)**: No, thank you for the question, Brad. So, a couple of things. In my comments I said increase in relation to our previous suites like, let's say, E3 or E5. Whatever
two months in, it's definitely much faster than that. And so, from that perspective. It's exciting to see, I’d say, the demand signal, the deployment signal. I was
looking at by tenant, even usage, it's faster than anything else because it's easier, right. I mean, it's sort of -- it shows up in your app, if you click on it, like any
ribbon thing and it becomes a daily habit. So it in fact, it reminds me a little bit of sort of the back-in-the day of PC adoption, right. It's kind of -- I think it first starts
off with few people having access. There are many companies that are doing standard issue, right. So just like PCs became standard issue at some point after
PCs being adopted by early adopters. I think that's the cycle that at least we expect. In terms of what we're seeing, it's actually interesting, If you look at the data
we have, summarization, that's what it's like number-one, like I'm doing summarization of Teams meetings inside of Teams, during the meeting, after the meeting,
word documents summarization, I get something in email on summarizing. So summarization has become a big deal. Drafts, right, you're drafting emails, drafting
documents. So, anytime you want to start something, the blank page thing goes away and you start by prompting and drafting. Chat, to me, the most powerful
feature is now you have the most important database in your company, which happens to be the database of your documents and communications. It is now
queryable by natural language in a powerful way, right. I can go and say, what are all the things Amy said, I should be watching out for next quarter and it will
come out with great detail. And so Chat, summarization, draft, also by the way, actions. One of the most used thing is, here's the Word document, go complete, I
mean, create a PowerPoint for me. So, those are the stuff that is also beginning. So, I feel like these all become -- but fundamentally, what happens is, if you
remember the PC adoption cycle, what it did was work artifact and work flow changed, right. You can imagine what forecasting was before excel and email and
what it was after. So similarly, you'll see work and workflow change as people summarize faster, draft regulatory submissions faster. Chat to get knowledge from
your business. And so, those are the things that we are seeing as overall patterns.

### Exchange 009

**Brad Zelnick (Deutsche Bank)**: Excellent, thank you so much.

**Brett Iversen (President)**: Thanks, Brad. Joe, next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.

### Exchange 010

**Brad Reback (Stifel)**: Great, thanks very much. Amy for many, many years in Commercial Office 365 seat growth has far outpaced ARPU and over the last couple of quarters, we're
getting a convergence, obviously, as the seat count gets really large. As we look-forward, should they run even for a period of time or should we expect ARPU to
outpace seat growth here in the short term? Thanks.

### Exchange 011

**Brad Reback (Stifel)**: That's great. Thanks very much.

**Brett Iversen (President)**: Thanks, Brad. Joe we have time for one last question.

Our last question will come from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Please proceed.
