We are off to a solid start to our fiscal year, driven by continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $38.9 billion in revenue, up 22%. \nAI-driven transformation is changing work, work artifacts and workflow across every role, function, and business process, helping customers drive new growth \nand operating leverage. All up, our AI business is on track to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion next quarter, which will make it the fastest \nbusiness in our history to reach this milestone. Now I'll highlight examples of our progress starting with infrastructure. Azure took share this quarter. We are \nseeing continued growth in cloud migration. Azure Arc now has over 39,000 customers across every industry, including American Tower, CTT, L'Or\u00e9al, up more \nthan 80% year-over-year. We now have data centers in over 60 regions around the world. And this quarter, we announced new cloud and AI infrastructure \ninvestments in Brazil, Italy, Mexico, and Sweden as we expand our capacity in line with our long-term demand signals. At the silicon layer, our new Cobalt 100 \nVMs are being used by companies like Databricks, Elastic, Siemens, Snowflake, and Synopsys to power their general-purpose workloads at up to 50% better \nprice performance than previous generations. On top of this, we are building out our next-generation AI infrastructure, innovating across the full stack to optimize \nour fleet for AI workloads. We offer the broadest selection of AI accelerators, including our first-party accelerator, Maia 100 as well as the latest GPUs from AMD \nand NVIDIA. In fact, we are the first cloud to bring up NVIDIA's Blackwell system with GB200-powered AI servers. Our partnership with OpenAI also continues to \ndeliver results. We have an economic interest in a company that has grown significantly in value, and we have built differentiated IP and are driving revenue \nmomentum. More broadly with Azure AI, we are building an end-to-end app platform to help customers build their own Copilots and agents. Azure OpenAI usage \nmore than doubled over the past six months as both digital natives like Grammarly and Harvey as well as established enterprises like Bajaj Finance, Hitachi, KT, \nand LG move apps from test to production. GE Aerospace, for example, used Azure OpenAI to build a new digital assistant for all 52,000 of its employees. In just \nthree months, it has been used to conduct over 500,000 internal queries and process more than 200,000 documents. And this quarter, we added support for \nOpenAI's newest model family, o1. We're also bringing industry-specific models through Azure AI, including a collection of best-in-class multimodal models for \nmedical imaging. And with the GitHub models, we now provide access to our full model catalog directly within the GitHub developer workflow. Azure AI is also \nincreasingly an on-ramp to our data and analytics services. As developers build new AI apps on Azure, we have seen an acceleration of Azure Cosmos DB and \nAzure SQL DB hyperscale usage as customers like Air India, Novo Nordisk, Telefonica, Toyota Motors North America, and Uniper take advantage of capabilities, \npurpose-built for AI applications. And with Microsoft Fabric, we provide a single AI-powered platform to help customers like Chanel, EY, KPMG, Swiss Air, and \nSyndigo unify their data across clouds. We now have over 16,000 paid Fabric customers, over 70% of the Fortune 500. Now on to developers. GitHub Copilot is \nchanging the way the world builds software. Copilot enterprise customers increased 55% quarter-over-quarter as companies like AMD and Flutter Entertainment \ntailor Copilot to their own code base. And we are introducing the next phase of AI code generation, making GitHub Copilot agentic across the developer workflow. \nGitHub Copilot Workspace is a developer environment which leverages agents from start to finish so developers can go from spec to plan to code all in natural \nlanguage. Copilot Auto Fix is an AI agent that helps developers at companies like Asurion and Auto Group fix vulnerabilities in their code over 3x faster than it \nwould take them on their own. We're also continuing to build on GitHub's open platform ethos by making more models available via GitHub Copilot. And we are \nexpanding the reach of GitHub to a new segment of developers introducing GitHub Spark, which enables anyone to build apps in natural language. Already, we \nhave brought generative AI to Power Platform to help customers use low-code, no-code tools to cut costs and development time. To date, nearly 600,000 \norganizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, up 4x year-over-year. Citizen developers at ZF, for example, built apps simply by describing \nwhat they need using natural language. And this quarter, we introduced new ways for customers to apply AI to streamline complex workflows with Power \nAutomate. Now on to work. We launched the next wave of Microsoft 365 Copilot innovation last month, bringing together Web, Work, and Pages as the new \ndesign system for knowledge work. Pages is the first new digital artifact for the AI age, and it's designed to help you ideate with AI and collaborate with other \npeople. We've also made Microsoft 365 Copilot responses 2x faster and improved response quality by nearly 3x. This innovation is driving accelerated usage, \nand the number of people using Microsoft 365 daily more than doubled quarter-over-quarter. We are also seeing increased adoption from customers in every\n\nindustry as they use Microsoft 365 Copilot to drive real business value. Vodafone, for example, will roll out Microsoft 365 Copilot to 68,000 employees after a trial\nshowed that, on average, they save three hours per person per week. And UBS will deploy 50,000 seats in our largest finserve deal to date. And we continue to\nsee enterprise customers coming back to buy more seats. All up, nearly 70% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot, and customers continue to adopt\nit at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite. Copilot is the UI for AI and with Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot Studio and Agents and now Autonomous\nAgents, we have built an end-to-end system for AI business transformation. With Copilot Studio, organizations can build and connect Microsoft 365 Copilot to", "char_count": 6335, "word_count": 1018, "token_count": 1355, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "MSFT_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q1_u_0001", "company": "MSFT", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2025, "period": "2025-Q1", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/MSFT/MSFT_FY2025_Q1.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

More broadly, we are seeing AI drive a\nfundamental change in the business applications market as customers shift from legacy apps to AI-first business processes. Dynamics 365 continues to take\nshare as organizations like Evron, Heineken, and Lexmark chose our apps over other providers. And monthly active users of Copilot across our CRM and ERP\nportfolio increased over 60% quarter-over-quarter. Our Dynamics 365 contact center is also winning customers like Curry's, Le Creuset, and RXO as it brings\ngenerative AI to every customer engagement channel. And just last week, we added 10 out-of-the-box autonomous agents to Dynamics 365 that helps customers\nautomatically qualify sales leads, track suppliers and work hand-in-hand with service reps to resolve issues. We're also bringing AI to industry-specific workflows.\nOne year in, DAX Copilot is now documenting over 1.3 million physician patient encounters each month at over 500 health care organizations like Baptist Medical\nGroup, Baylor Scott & White, Baltimore Medical Center, Novant Health, and Overlake Medical Center. It is showing faster revenue growth than GitHub Copilot did\nin this first year. And new features extend DAX beyond notes helping physicians automatically draft referrals after visit instructions and diagnostic evidence. On\ntop of all this AI innovation, Microsoft Teams usage remains at all-time highs as people use it to streamline all their communications. Nearly 75% of our Teams\nEnterprise customers now buy Premium, Phone, or Rooms. When it comes to Windows, our new class of Copilot+ PCs is winning new customers. They offer\nbest-in-class AI capability, performance, and value. AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm now all support Copilot+ PCs. This quarter, we also introduced new AI experience\nonly available on Copilot+ PCs like Click to Do, which places an interactive overlay over your desktop to suggest next best actions. And as we approach the end\nof support for Windows 10 a year from now, we are well positioned to transition our customers to Windows 11, ensuring they benefit from enhanced features and\nsecurity improvements we've introduced over the past few years. Now on to security. We continue to prioritize security above all else. With our Secure Future\nInitiative, we have dedicated the equivalent of 34,000 full-time engineers to address the highest-priority security tasks. We have made significant progress to\nbetter protect tenants' identities, networks, and engineering systems, and we have created new processes to ensure security is prioritized at every level of the\nCompany. And we continue to take what we learn and turn it into innovations across our products. Security Copilot, for example, is being used by companies in\nevery industry, including Clifford Chance, Intesa Sanpaolo, and Shell to perform SecOps tasks faster and more accurately. And we are now helping customers\nprotect their AI deployments too. Customers have used Defender or Discover and secured more than 750,000 gen AI app instances and used Purview to audit\nover one billion Copilot interactions to meet their compliance obligations. And all up, we continue to take share across all major categories we serve and are\nconsistently recognized by top analysts as a leader in 20 categories, more than any other vendor. Now let me turn to our consumer businesses, starting with\nLinkedIn. Member growth continues to accelerate with markets in India and Brazil both growing at double digits. We are also seeing record engagement as we\nintroduce new ways for our more than 1 billion members to connect, sell services, get hired, and share knowledge. Our investments in rich formats like video\nstrengthened our leadership in B2B advertising and amplified the value we deliver to our customers. Weekly immersive video views increased 6x\nquarter-over-quarter, and total video viewership on LinkedIn is up 36% year-over-year. Our AI-powered tools also continue to transform how people sell, learn\nand hire. In sales, new AI features help every team member perform at the level of top sellers and drive more profitable growth. In Learning, just yesterday, we\nannounced updates to our coaching experience, including personalized career development plans. LinkedIn's first agent hiring assistant will help hirers find\nqualified candidates faster by tackling the most time-consuming task. Already hirers who use AI Assistant messages see a 44% higher acceptance rate compared\nto those who don't. And our hiring business continues to take share. Now on to search, advertising, and news. With Copilot, we are seeing the first step towards\ncreating a new AI companion for everyone with new Copilot experience we introduced earlier this month includes a refreshed design and tone along with\nimproved speed and fluency across the web and mobile. And it includes advanced capabilities like voice and vision that make it more delightful and useful and\nfeel more natural. You can both browse and converse with Copilot simultaneously because Copilot sees what you see. More broadly, AI is also transforming\nsearch, browsers, and digital advertising, and we continue to take share across Bing and Edge. Bing ex-TAC revenue growth outpaced the search market. Now\non to gaming. One year since we closed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, we are focused on building a business positioned for long-term growth, driven\nby higher-margin content and services. You already see this transformation in our results as we diversify the ways that gamers access our content. We set new\nrecords for monthly active users in the quarter as more players than ever play our games across devices and on the Xbox platform. Game Pass also set a new\nQ1 record for total revenue and average revenue per subscriber. And as we look ahead, our IP across our studios has never been stronger. Last week's launch of\nBlack Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty release ever, setting a record for day one players as well as Game Pass subscriber ads on launch day. And unit sales\non PlayStation and Steam were also up over 60% year-over-year. This speaks to our strategy of meeting gamers where they are by enabling them to play more\ngames across the screens, they spend their time on. In closing, we are rapidly innovating to expand our opportunity across our commercial and consumer\nbusinesses. In three weeks' time, we will hold our Ignite conference, and I look forward to sharing more then about how we are helping every business function\nuse AI to drive growth in this new era. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.", "char_count": 6657, "word_count": 1067, "token_count": 1354, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "MSFT_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q1_u_0002", "company": "MSFT", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2025, "period": "2025-Q1", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/MSFT/MSFT_FY2025_Q1.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

This quarter, revenue was $65.6 billion, up 16%, and earnings per share was $3.30, an increase of 10%. With \nstrong execution by our sales teams and partners, we delivered a solid start to our fiscal year with double-digit top and bottom-line growth. We also saw continued \nshare gains across many of our businesses. In our commercial business, increased demand and growth in long-term commitments to our Microsoft Cloud \nplatform drove our results. Commercial bookings were ahead of expectations and increased 30% and 23% in constant currency. Results were driven by strong \nexecution across our core annuity sales motions and growth in the number of $10 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Additionally, we also \nsaw an increase in the number of $100 million-plus contracts for Azure. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 22% and 21% in constant \ncurrency to $259 billion. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 17% year-over-year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the \nnext 12 months, increased 27%. And this quarter, our annuity mix increased to 98%. In addition to commercial results that were in line with expectations, we also \nsaw some benefit from in-period revenue recognition across Microsoft 365 commercial, Azure, and our on-premises server business. At a company level, \nActivision contributed a net impact of approximately 3 points to revenue growth, with a 2-point drag on operating income growth and had a negative $0.05 impact \nto earnings per share. A reminder that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner \nto first-party and includes $911 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs. FX did not have a significant impact on \nour results and was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud \nrevenue was $38.9 billion and grew 22%, roughly in line with expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased 2 points year-over-year to 71%. \nThis was slightly better than expected due to improvement in Azure, although the gross margin percentage decrease year-over-year continues to be driven by \nscaling our AI infrastructure. Company gross margin dollars increased 13% and 14% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was 69%, down 2 points \nyear-over-year, driven by the lower Microsoft Cloud gross margin noted earlier as well as the impact from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and\n\ntransaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Operating expenses increased 12%, lower than expected due to our focus on cost efficiencies and \nongoing prioritization work. Operating expense growth included 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, headcount at the end of \nSeptember was 8% higher than a year ago. Excluding the growth of the Activision acquisition, headcount was 2% higher. Operating income increased 14% and \noperating margins were 47%, down 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the net impact from the Activision acquisition, operating margins were up 1 point as we \ncontinue to drive efficiencies across our businesses as we invest in AI infrastructure and capabilities. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and \nBusiness Processes was $28.3 billion and grew 12% and 13% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected results across all \nbusinesses. M365 commercial cloud revenue increased 15% and 16% in constant currency with business trends that were as expected. The better-than-expected \nresult was due to a small benefit from the in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. ARPU growth was primarily driven by E5 as well as M365 Copilot. Paid \nM365 commercial seats grew 8% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was driven by our small and medium \nbusiness and frontline worker offerings. M365 commercial cloud revenue represents nearly 90% of total M365 commercial products and cloud services. M365 \ncommercial products revenue increased 2% and 3% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily due to the benefit from in-period revenue recognition \nnoted earlier. M365 consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. M365 consumer cloud revenue increased 6% \nand 7% in constant currency, with continued momentum in M365 consumer subscriptions, which grew 10% to 84.4 million. M365 consumer cloud revenue \nrepresents 85% of total M365 consumer products and cloud services. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, slightly ahead of \nexpectations with growth across all lines of business. Dynamics revenue grew 14%, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 18% and 19% in constant currency with \ncontinued growth across all workloads and continued share gains. As a reminder, Dynamics 365 represents about 90% of total Dynamics revenue. Segment \ngross margin dollars increased 11% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year, driven by scaling our AI \ninfrastructure. Operating expenses increased 2% and operating income increased 16%. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $24.1 billion, \nincreasing 20% and 21% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 33% and 34% in constant currency, with \nhealthy consumption trends that were in line with expectations. The better-than-expected result was due to the small benefit from in-period revenue recognition \nnoted earlier. Azure growth included roughly 12 points from AI services, similar to last quarter. Demand continues to be higher than our available capacity. Non-AI \ngrowth trends were also in line with expectations in total and across regions as customers continued to migrate and modernize on the Azure platform. The non-AI \npoint contribution to Azure growth was sequentially lower by approximately 1 point. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 1%. \nLower-than-expected transactional purchasing ahead of the Windows Server 2025 launch as well as lower purchasing of licenses running a multi-cloud \nenvironment was mostly offset by the benefit from in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. Enterprise and partner services revenue decreased 1% and was \nrelatively unchanged in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15%, and gross margin percentage decreased 3 points year-over-year, driven \nby scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 8% and operating income grew 18%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue of $13.2 billion \nincreasing 17% with 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations, driven by gaming and search. Windows OEM and \ndevices revenue increased 2% year-over-year as better-than-expected results in Windows OEM due to mix shift to higher monetizing markets was partially offset \nby the lower-than-expected results in devices due to execution challenges in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased \n18% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily due to continued execution improvement. We saw rate expansion in addition to healthy \nvolume growth in both Edge and Bing. And in gaming, revenue increased 43% and 44% in constant currency with 43 points of net impact from the Activision \nacquisition. Results were ahead of expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected performance in both first- and third-party content as well as consoles. Xbox \ncontent and services revenue increased 61% with 53 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 17% \nin constant currency with 12 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Our strong \nexecution on margin improvement in gaming and search was offset by sales mix shift to those businesses. Operating expenses increased 49% with 51 points \nfrom the Activision acquisition. Operating income decreased 4%. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $20 \nbillion, in line with expectations, and cash paid for PP&E was $14.9 billion. Roughly half of our cloud and AI-related spend continues to be for long-lived assets \nthat will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud and AI spend is primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve \ncustomers based on demand signals. Cash flow from operations was $34.2 billion, up 12%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by \nhigher supplier employee and tax payments. Free cash flow was $19.3 billion, down 7% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud \nand AI offerings. This quarter, other income expense was negative $283 million, significantly more favorable than anticipated due to foreign currency \nremeasurement and net gains on investments. Our losses on investments accounted for under the equity method were as expected. Our effective tax rate was \napproximately 19%. And finally, we returned $9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q2 outlook, which unless \nspecifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. First, FX. With the weaker U.S. dollar and assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase \ntotal revenue and segment level revenue growth by less than 1 point. We expect FX to have no meaningful impact to COGS or operating expense growth. Our \noutlook has many of the trends we saw in Q1 continue through Q2. Customer demand for our differentiated solutions should drive another quarter of strong \ngrowth. In commercial bookings, we expect strong growth on a growing expiry base driven by increased long-term commitments to our platform and strong \nexecution across core annuity sales motions. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased \nquarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 70%, down year-over-year, driven by the impact of \nscaling our AI infrastructure. We expect capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis, given our cloud and AI demand signals. As I said last quarter, we \nwill stay aligned and, if needed, adjust to the demand signals we see. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs \nand the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next, segment guidance, starting with Productivity and Business Processes. We are the market leader when it comes \nto knowledge-based Copilots and agents in the enterprise space, and we are focused on continuing to gain share across our productivity solutions. Therefore, we \nexpect revenue in Productivity and Business Processes to grow between 10% and 11% in constant currency or $28.7 billion to $29 billion. M365 commercial \ncloud revenue growth should be approximately 14% in constant currency with moderating seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5 \nand M365 Copilot. For H2, we expect revenue growth to remain relatively stable compared to Q2. We continue to see growth in M365 Copilot seats, and we \nexpect the related revenue to continue to grow gradually over time. For M365 commercial products, we expect revenue to decline in the low single digits. As a \nreminder, M365 commercial products include on-premises components of M365 suites. So, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from \nin-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid-single digits driven by M365 \nsubscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%, driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics 365, we expect \nrevenue growth to be in the mid- to high teens, driven by continued growth across all workloads. Next, Intelligent Cloud. Helping our customers transform and \ngrow with innovative cloud and AI solutions is driving continued growth in Azure. Therefore, we expect revenue in Intelligent Cloud to grow between 18% and \n20% in constant currency or $25.55 billion to $25.85 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability \nprimarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q2 revenue growth to be 31% to 32% in constant currency, \ndriven by strong demand for our portfolio of services. We expect consumption growth to be stable compared to Q1, and we expect to add more sequential dollars \nto Azure than any other quarter in history. We expect the contribution from AI services to be similar to last quarter, given the continued capacity constraints as \nwell as some capacity that shifted out of Q2. And in H2, we still expect Azure growth to accelerate from H1 as our capital investments create an increase in \navailable AI capacity to serve more of the growing demand. And in our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits\n\non a prior year comparable that benefited from purchasing ahead of Windows Server 2012 end of support. And in Enterprise and partner services, we expect\nrevenue growth to be in the low single digits. Now to More Personal Computing. We continue to make decisions to prioritize strategic higher-margin opportunities\nwithin each of our consumer businesses. Our outlook reflects the improvement in gross and operating margins from this prioritization work across gaming, search,\nand devices. We expect revenue in More Personal Computing to be $13.85 billion to $14.25 billion. Windows OEM and devices revenue should decline in the low\nto mid-single digits. We expect Windows OEM revenue growth in line with the PC market to be more than offset by a decline in devices as the trends from Q1\ncontinue. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the high teens, with continued growth in both volume and revenue per search. This\nwill be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be in the high single digits. And in gaming, we expect revenue to\ndecline in the high single digits due to hardware. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth to be relatively flat. We're excited about last week's\nlaunch of Call of Duty, where we saw the most Game Pass subscriber adds we've ever seen on a launch day. There are two things about the launch that are\ndifferent than the Call of Duty launch a year ago, where revenue was mostly recognized in the quarter of purchase. First, the game is available on Game Pass so\nfor players who play through Game Pass, the subscription revenue is recognized over time. Second, the game requires an online connection to play so even for\nplayers who purchased the standalone game, revenue recognition will also occur ratably over time. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow\nbetween 11% and 13% in constant currency or to be between $21.9 billion to $22.1 billion, and operating expense to grow approximately 7% in constant currency\nor to be between $16.4 billion and $16.5 billion. This should result in another quarter of operating margin expansion. Other income and expense is expected to be\nroughly negative $1.5 billion, primarily driven by our share of the expected loss from OpenAI, which is accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we\ndo not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. As you heard from Satya, our strategic partnership and investment in OpenAI has\nbeen pivotal in building and scaling our AI business and positioning us as the leader in the AI platform wave. And lastly, we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be\napproximately 19%. In closing, we remain focused on strategically investing in the long-term opportunities that we believe drive shareholder value. Monetization\nfrom these investments continues to grow, and we're excited that only 2.5 years in, our AI business is on track to surpass $10 billion of annual revenue run rate in\nQ2. This will be the fastest business in our history to reach this milestone. We are committed to growing this leadership position across our entire Microsoft Cloud\nwhile maintaining our disciplined focus on cost management and prioritization across every team.

So, Satya, the expansion of capabilities, the speed of innovation, the magnitude of the opportunities ahead for\ngenerative AI makes this the most exciting period for software I've seen in my 25 years of covering this space. And based upon this call, it seems like you share\nthat excitement. But in my investor conversation, that excitement also feeds two related questions, and they both have to do with constraints. And the first is like\nwhat are the internal constraints or guardrails that Microsoft has when it comes to investing behind these innovations, particularly in relation to the funding of\nfuture generations of foundational models, where people were talking about price tags, you want to spend the tens of billions or even $100 billion-plus? And then\non the other side of the spectrum, what are the external constraints that Microsoft sees in building out this capacity to meet the demand and capture the\nopportunity, particularly constraints in your ability to power all these new data centers being built out and powered in an environmentally sustainable fashion? I'd\nlove to get the Microsoft perspective on both those questions.", "char_count": 1188, "word_count": 192, "token_count": 227, "exchange_id": "ex_001", "exchange_role": "question", "chunk_id": "MSFT_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q1_u_0005", "company": "MSFT", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2025, "period": "2025-Q1", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/MSFT/MSFT_FY2025_Q1.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

I think on the first point, ultimately, when you think about, let's say, capital outlay for training because that's essentially what\nyou're asking, it is going to be rate limited by your monetization of inference, given generation, right? So just like in the past, we would allocate capital to build out\ncloud based on the demand signal we were seeing and then we would then project the demand, and that's what we would build for. So, you can think of training\nessentially as that, right, which is you're building the next-generation model so that then you have a more capable model that then drives more inference demand,\nright? So ultimately, even with all the scaling laws and what have you, I think you ultimately will normalize to having a pace. In fact, I think the best way to think\nabout even is given that Moore's Law effectively is working on the sort of silicon and system size, so it's just not compute, right, it's efficiencies in compute, it's\ndata as well as algorithms. You will want to sort of keep on that curve, which is you really want to refresh your fleet with the Moore's Law every year and then\neffectively depreciate it over the period of the life cycle of it. And then the inference demand ultimately will cover how much we invest in training because that's, I\nthink, at the end of the day, you're all subject to ultimately demand. So, the second piece of the external constraints, we have run into, obviously, lots of external\nconstraints because this demand all showed up pretty fast, right? I mean, if you think about even the most hit product of this generation all are in our cloud, right,\nwhether it's ChatGPT, whether it's Copilot, whether it's GitHub Copilot or even DAX Copilot, I mean, pick the top four or five products of this generation, they're all\nsort of in and around our ecosystem. And so therefore, we ran into a set of constraints, which are everything because DCs don't get built overnight. So, there is\nDCs, there is power. And so that's sort of been the short-term constraint. Even in Q2, for example, some of the demand issues we have or our ability to fulfill\ndemand is because of, in fact, external third-party stuff that we leased moving up. So that's the constraints we have. But in the long run, we do need effectively\npower and we need DCs. And some of these things are more long lead. But I feel pretty good that going into the second half of even this fiscal year, that some of\nthat supply/demand will match up.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.

Maybe this is a great question because I can sort of reiterate some of the points I made and tie them together a little bit. In Q1, the 34% in CC, as\nwe talked about, that upside versus the 33% that we had guided to was primarily due to some revenue recognition benefits. And so, I think about that on a sort of\na pure consumption basis and AI as being 33%. And you think about 1 point or 2 of decel that we've guided to, and the majority of that is due to, unfortunately,\nsome supply pushouts that I mentioned and then Satya reiterated in terms of AI supply coming online that we counted on. The underlying consumption growth is\nstable Q1 to Q2. And so, to your question on some ins and outs, it is certainly some ins and outs. I do, as you heard, have confidence as we get a good influx of\nsupply across the second half of the year, particularly on the AI side that we'll be better able to do some supply-demand matching and hence, while we're talking\nabout acceleration in the back half.

Unlike the cloud transition, we're doing it on a global basis in parallel as\nopposed to sequential, given the nature of the demand.

And then, of course, all of the product innovation, right? One of the things that my own sort of conviction of OpenAI\nand what they were doing came about when I started seeing something like GitHub Copilot as a product get built or DAX Copilot get built or M365 Copilot get\nbuilt. So, we have a fantastic portfolio of innovation that we build on top of that. And the same also, I would say, we are investors. We feel very, very good about\nsort of our investment stake in OpenAI. And so, our focus, and we're always in constant dialogue with them in a partnership like this where both sides have\nachieved mutual success at the pace at which we've achieved it, that means we need to kind of push each other to do more, to capture the moment and that's\nwhat we plan to do, and we intend to keep building on it.", "char_count": 1504, "word_count": 278, "token_count": 344, "exchange_id": "ex_004", "exchange_role": "answer", "chunk_id": "MSFT_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q1_u_0012", "company": "MSFT", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2025, "period": "2025-Q1", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/MSFT/MSFT_FY2025_Q1.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

It's important that we continue to invest capital to meet not only their demand signal and needs for\ncompute but also from our broader customers. That's partially why you've seen us committing the amount of capital we've seen over the past few quarters is our\ncommitment to both grow together and for us to continue to grow the Azure platform for customers beyond them. And so, I don't really think of it as how do you\nbalance it. It's just we have customers who have needs and real use cases and delivering value today. And if we can't meet that, we need to work to meet it. And\nthat means working harder and faster to make sure we do that, which is what the team is committed to do. Second piece of your question, I think, was on the\nimpact to other income.

The system we have built is Copilot, Copilot Studio, agents and autonomous agents. You should think of that as the spectrum of things, right? So ultimately, \nthe way we think about how this all comes together is you need humans to be able to interface with AI. So, the UI layer for AI is Copilot. You can then use Copilot \nStudio to extend Copilot. For example, you want to connect it to your CRM system, to your office system, to your HR system. You do that through Copilot Studio \nby building agents effectively. You also build autonomous agents. So, you can use even that's the announcement we made a couple of weeks ago is you can \neven use Copilot Studio to build autonomous agents. Now these autonomous agents are working independently, but from time to time, they need to raise an \nexception, right? So autonomous agents are not fully autonomous because at some point, they need to either notify someone or have someone input something. \nAnd when they need to do that, they need a UI layer and that's where again, it's Copilot. So, Copilot, Copilot agents built-in Copilot Studio, autonomous agents \nbuilt in Copilot Studio, that's the full system we think that comes together, and we feel very, very good about the position. And then, of course, we are taking the\n\nunderlying system services across that entire stack that I just talked about, making it available in Azure, right? So, you have the raw infrastructure if you want it.\nYou have the model layer independent of it. You have the AI app server in Azure AI, right? So, everything is also a building block service in Azure for you to be\nable to build. In fact, if you want to build everything that we have built in the Copilot stack, you can build it yourself using the AI platform.

On the first part, Rishi, to your question, I think we feel very, very good about the momentum we have in the commercial Copilot, right? As I said in my\nremarks and Amy talked about, this is the fastest growth of a new suite in M365. If I compare it to what we saw even way back in E3 or E5 or the transition from O\nto M, this is really much faster, right? It's the numbers of penetration of the Fortune 500 and then the fact that they're coming back for more seats and what have\nyou. So, it's very strong in that context. The other thing I'd like to mention is that we want this to be something that is systemic, right, because people need to be\nable to put the security controls, then they need to deploy, then there's skilling and then there's change management. So, this is not like you just -- it's not a tool\nlike when I talk about Copilot, Copilot Studio, agents. It's really as much about a new way to work. And sometimes I describe it as what happened throughout the\n'90s with PC penetration. After all, if you take a business process like forecasting, what was it like pre e-mail and Excel and post e-mail and Excel, that's the type\nof change that you see with Copilot. But overall, we feel great about the rate of progress and the penetration. And then on the consumer side, look, for us, the\nexciting part here is to be able to use the same investment we are making in the commercial where we have structural strength and then beyond the offense. One\nof the things that I think I hope you all catch in our earnings is ex-TAC, our revenue, when it comes to what we describe as search, news and ads, is growing\nfaster than market. So, it's fantastic to see that. And so that's kind of our consumer business, which in Microsoft's large scope, it's sort of even a $10-plus billion\nbusiness or sometimes go missing. But in our case, it is actually a fantastic growth business that's growing faster than market. We feel good about how we will\nuse AI in LinkedIn. In fact, LinkedIn is a consumer business as you know. You saw even this week, they announced some new capabilities for both consumers\nand, in their case, even recruiting. So, we think that AI, the same investment gets monetized even through LinkedIn's innovation. And gaming, of course, is\nanother place where you'll see some of these things apply. And Windows, right? So, the place where I think I'm excited about is Copilot+ PCs. For us, it's not\nabout having a disconnected edge. It's about having hybrid AI where the rebirth of sort of the PC as the edge of AI is going to be one of the most exciting things\nfor developers. So, we feel well positioned, quite frankly, with the same investment. So, this is -- that's the thing. We're not a conglomerate here. We are sort of\none company. That means we invest once and then we have all these categories that benefit from that, and that's the theory of the firm for us. And so, we feel\ngood about all of that coming together.", "char_count": 2949, "word_count": 549, "token_count": 694, "exchange_id": "ex_009", "exchange_role": "answer", "chunk_id": "MSFT_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q1_u_0025", "company": "MSFT", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2025, "period": "2025-Q1", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/MSFT/MSFT_FY2025_Q1.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}
