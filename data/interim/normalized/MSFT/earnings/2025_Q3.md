## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Keith Weiss (Morgan Stanley)**: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and congratulations on a fantastic quarter in what all of us are looking at as a difficult environment, a lot of
uncertainty out there, so really impressive to put up the results that you guys did. One of the things that we heard a lot about this quarter in the media and press
reports was changing data center commitments, maybe Microsoft walking away from some of those data center commitments. But it sounds like the AI demand is
very strong. You’re talking about not being able to hit all that demand with supply. Can you talk to us about what’s going on with your datacenter strategy? Are
there any shifts taking place? And maybe in particular, Satya, you could talk about some of the comments that you had made about the potential risk for
oversupplies and GPUs out in the future. What exactly was that risk you were talking about? And are you incorporating that risk into your datacenter strategy?

**Satya Nadella (CEO)**: Yeah. First of all, thanks, Keith, for the questions. The reality is, we’ve always been making adjustments to build, lease, what pace we build, all through the last
10-15 years. It’s just that you all pay a lot more attention to what we do quarter over quarter nowadays. Having said that, the key thing for us is to have our builds
and lease be positioned for what is the workload growth of the future. That’s what you have to go and seek to. There’s a demand part to it. There is the shape of
the workload part to it, and there is a location part to it. You don’t want to be upside-down on having one big data center in one region, when you have a global
demand footprint. You don’t want to be upside-down when the shape of demand changes, because, after all, with essentially pre-training plus test time compute,
that’s a big change in terms of how you think about even what is training. Forget inferencing. Fundamentally, given all of that, and then every time there’s great
Moore’s Law, but remember, this is a compounding S-curve, which is, there’s Moore’s Law, there’s system software, there’s model architecture changes, there’s
the app server efficiency. Given all of that, we just want to make sure we’re building, accounting for the latest and greatest information we have on all of that. And
that’s what you see reflected, and I feel very, very good about the pace. In fact, Amy just mentioned, we will be short power. And so, therefore, but it’s not power.
It’s not a blanket statement. I need power in specific places so that we can either lease or build at the pace at which we want. And so, that’s the plan that we’re
executing. Maybe, Amy, you can add to that.

### Exchange 002

**Keith Weiss (Morgan Stanley)**: Excellent. Thank you, guys.

### Exchange 003

**Brent Thill (Jefferies)**: Thanks. Satya, on your comment about accelerating demand for cloud migrations, I’m curious if you could dig in and extrapolate a little more what you’re seeing
there. Thank you.

**Satya Nadella (CEO)**: Thanks, Brent. Yeah, I sort of think about three big things that are happening in the cloud, all at parallel, and there is also a relationship between them. One is, I’ll 
just say, the classic migration of whether it’s SQL, Windows Server. And so, that’s, again, got good steady state progress, because the reality is, I think 
everyone’s now, perhaps there’s another kick in the datacenter migrations, just because of the efficiency the cloud provides. That’s one part. The second piece is 
good data growth. You saw Postgres on Azure. I mean, forgetting SQL Server, Postgres on Azure is growing. Cosmos is growing, the analytic stuff I talked about 
with Fabric. It’s even the others, whether it is Databricks or even Snowflake on Azure are growing. We feel very good about Fabric growth and our data growth. 
Then the cloud-native growth, this is, again, before we even get to AI, some of the core compute consumption of cloud-native players is also very healthy. It was 
healthy throughout the quarter. We projected to go moving forward as well. Then the thing to notice is the ratio, and I think we’ve mentioned this multiple times 
before. If you look underneath even ChatGPT, in fact, that team does a fantastic job of thinking about not only their growth in terms of AI accelerators they need. 
They use Cosmos DB. They use Postgres. They use core compute and storage. And so, there’s even a ratio between any AI workload in terms of AI accelerator 
to others. Those are the four pockets, I would say, or four different trend lines, which all have a relationship with each other. And if I step back, and Amy and I talk 
a lot about this, this time around, there’s nothing certain for sure in the future, except for one thing, which is our largest business is our infrastructure business. 
And the good news here is the next big platform shift builds on that. It’s not a complete rebuild, having gone through some of these platform shift, where you have 
to come out on the other side with a full rebuild. If there is good news here, it’s that we have a good business in Azure that continues to grow, and the new

platform depends on that. We want to stay disciplined and execute super well on that.

### Exchange 004

**Brent Thill (Jefferies)**: Thank you.

### Exchange 005

**Mark Moerdler (Bernstein)**: Thank you very much for taking my question, and I will reiterate what my peers have said. Congratulations on the great quarter. Satya and Amy, Microsoft is a
very different business than it was during the last recession. Incredible job you’ve done. If we get into a recession, and I hope we don’t, how do you think about
the stability, the sustainability, revenue volatility of Microsoft today, if we were to get into recession? Would the business react early to recession or late? Would a
recession have a more shallow impact on revenue? Any thoughts would be appreciated.

**Satya Nadella (CEO)**: Maybe I’ll start and then Amy should add, Mark. The way, at least, I think we will approach it is, quite frankly, be very focused on how we help our customers if
there is any turbulence in the macro, because one of the things that we feel we can do, just because of the efficiencies of the cloud, and the footprint we have and
the differentiated layers of the stack, from the SaaS application side to the infrastructure side, I think if you buy into the argument that software is the most
malleable resource we have to fight any type of inflationary pressure or any type of growth pressure where you need to do more with less, I think we can be super
helpful in that. And so, if anything, we would probably have more of that mindset is how do we make sure we are helping our customers? And then, of course,
we’ll look to share gains.

### Exchange 006

**Karl Keirstead (UBS)**: Okay, thanks. A number of metrics to applaud, but I think the one that stands out to me is the 16 point growth rate lift to Azure from AI. Satya and Amy, I just
wanted to ask if you could unpack that a little bit. Of course, you mentioned that you got a bit of a kicker from capacity coming online. But I’m a little bit more
interested in where the demand came in above expectations, like what workload type. It’s hard for us to see that on the outside. Was it a surge in ChatGPT
inference that landed in Azure? Was it an uptick in enterprise AI adoption? And Amy, do you think that 16 points could be higher in June? Thank you.

### Exchange 007

**Kash Rangan (Goldman Sachs)**: Hi, thank you very much. One question for Amy. You’ve said in the past that you can attain better and better capital efficiency with the Cloud business, and
probably Cloud and AI business. Where do you stand today, Amy? Maybe, Satya, you can opine as well, that you’ve said before that you can slow down your
CapEx growth rate, while still accelerate Azure, which includes AI. Can we get a market to market on that? Thank you.

**Satya Nadella (CEO)**: Yeah, I mean, I think at a macro level, I think the way to think about this is, you can ask the question, what’s the difference between a hosting business and a
hyperscale business? It’s software. That’s, I think, the gist of it. Yes, for sure, it’s a capital intensive business, but capital efficiency comes from that system wide
software optimization. And that’s what makes the hyperscale business attractive, and that’s what we want to just keep executing super well on.

### Exchange 008

**Kash Rangan (Goldman Sachs)**: Super, Thanks so much.

### Exchange 009

**Mark Murphy (JPMorgan)**: Thank you so much. Satya, you had commented recently that the DeepSeek moment is a real thing, and you had said that software efficiencies mean that the
fleet will be aged for a longer time. Can you comment on how those advances are affecting the pace and volume of AI experimentation and activity in the
marketplace? And Amy, could we start to consider the possibility that software enhancements might extend the useful life assumption that you’re using for GPUs,
or is it a little premature to be thinking that way?

**Satya Nadella (CEO)**: Yeah. First of all, I think some of the work that actually, OpenAI first pioneered and did with all of the reasoning models, and of course, DeepSeek has added to it
and done good work as well, and others as well, the idea that you can have test time compute plus pre-training, and then some of the great optimization at
inference time that has all happened has proven out. I mean, if you look at it, I would say for every Moore’s Law change and movement, there’s probably a 10x
improvement because of software. That’s what’s happening with these models. Some of it comes from model architecture. Some of that comes from data
efficiency, compute efficiency, and what have you. That’s what we are riding, and we feel that, all up, when you have a commodity that is getting that better, then
the question is, how do you build out a fleet that’s super balanced, so that then the workloads can be built and can, in fact, take advantage of that efficiency at the
underlying infrastructure? I mean, it’s kind of like virtualization. What is the difference between servers and, again, client server with virtualization? It was
efficiency. What is the difference between virtualization and cloud? It was efficiency. What is the difference between this generation of cloud and AI? It’s
efficiency. The more you can kind of continue to think about software driving that efficiency is what drives demand, ultimately.

### Exchange 010

**Mark Murphy (JPMorgan)**: Thank you.

### Exchange 011

**Kirk Materne (Evercore)**: Yes, thanks very much, and congrats on a great quarter. Amy, you mentioned that the upside in Azure came from the non-AI services this time around. I was
wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about that. And I guess as you look forward, maybe what’s different this go round versus what we saw a few years
ago, when, obviously, things like optimization weighed on the growth a little bit? It sounds like the product portfolio is much broader right now, but just wondering if
you could add some color on that front. Thank you.

### Exchange 012

**Kirk Materne (Evercore)**: Thank you.

**Satya Nadella (CEO)**: Thank you.
