NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization. Visa Inc., together with its subsidiaries (Visa or the Company), is a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa operates one of the world’s largest electronic payments networks — VisaNet — which provides transaction processing services, primarily authorization, clearing and settlement. The Company offers products, solutions and services that facilitate secure, reliable and efficient money movement for participants in the ecosystem. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients.

Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Company consolidates entities for which it has a controlling financial interest, including variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to Visa’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2024 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies.

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.

Use of estimates. The preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

In December 2024, Visa acquired Featurespace Limited, a developer of real-time artificial intelligence payments protection technology that prevents and mitigates payments fraud and financial crime risks, for a purchase consideration of $946 million. Due to the limited amount of time since the acquisition date, the initial allocation of the purchase price has not yet been completed. On a provisional basis, the Company allocated $143 million of the purchase consideration to technology, customer relationships and deferred tax liabilities and the remaining $803 million to goodwill. The Company expects to finalize the purchase price allocation once the information required to complete the accounting is available, but no later than one year from the acquisition date.

The nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of the Company’s revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through the Company’s revenue categories and geographical markets. The following tables disaggregate the Company’s net revenue by revenue category and by geography:

| | | | | | |

For the three months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, revenue from value-added services was $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. Revenue from value-added services is recognized within data processing, other and service revenue.

Remaining performance obligations are comprised of deferred revenue and contract revenue that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods primarily related to value-added services. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining performance obligations were $4.3 billion. The Company expects approximately half to be recognized as revenue in the next two years and the remaining thereafter. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is affected by several factors, including contract modifications and terminations, which could impact the estimate of amounts allocated to remaining performance obligations and when such revenue could be recognized.

Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans

U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan

Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, certain litigation (U.S. covered litigation) are paid. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. See Note 13—Legal Matters.

The following table presents the changes in the U.S. litigation escrow account:

(1)These payments are associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 13—Legal Matters.

Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan

Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (VE territory covered litigation). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (VE territory covered losses) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in right to recover for covered losses, a contra-equity account within stockholders’ equity, before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than €20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in right to recover for covered losses is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity.

The following table presents the activities related to VE territory covered losses in the preferred stock and right to recover for covered losses within stockholders’ equity:

Level 1 assets and liabilities. Money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and marketable equity securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan.

Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.

U.S. Government-sponsored Debt Securities and U.S. Treasury Securities

The amortized cost, unrealized gains and losses and fair value of debt securities were as follows:

For the three months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized net unrealized losses of $83 million and net unrealized gains of $36 million, respectively, on marketable and non-marketable equity securities held as of period end.

Fair value measurement alternative. The Company’s investments in privately held companies do not have readily determinable fair values. These investments are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that significant inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment.

The following table summarizes the Company’s non-marketable equity securities held as of period end that were accounted for using the fair value measurement alternative:

| | | | | | | | | | | |

Other Fair Value Disclosures

Debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, instruments. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $20.6 billion and $18.4 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $20.8 billion and $19.2 billion, respectively.

Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying values of settlement receivable and payable and customer collateral are an approximate fair value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Non-financial assets. Certain non-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are subject to non-recurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be impaired. The Company performed an annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2024, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicated that impairment existed as of December 31, 2024.

Note 8—Settlement Guarantee Management

The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events.

The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. For the three months ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s maximum daily settlement exposure was $153.4 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $89.7 billion. To mitigate the risk of settlement exposure, the Company has various forms of collateral including restricted cash,

letters of credit, guarantees, beneficial rights to trust assets and pledged securities. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had total collateral of $7.9 billion.

(1)Shares repurchased in the open market are retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares.

(2)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Average repurchase cost per share and total cost are calculated based on unrounded numbers and include applicable taxes. As of December 31, 2024, shares repurchased in the open market include $70 million unsettled repurchases.

In October 2023, the Company’s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of $25.0 billion, providing multi-year flexibility. This authorization has no expiration date. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $9.1 billion. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2023 have been completed.

Dividends. For the three months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company declared and paid dividends of $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. On January 28, 2025, the Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.59 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of all other outstanding common and preferred stock on an as-converted basis), payable on March 3, 2025 to all holders of record as of February 11, 2025.

Class B common stock. In January 2024, Visa’s common stockholders approved amendments to the Company’s certificate of incorporation that authorized Visa to implement an exchange offer program that released transfer restrictions on portions of the Company’s class B common stock by allowing holders to exchange a portion of their outstanding shares of class B common stock for shares of freely tradeable class C common stock. The certificate of incorporation amendments automatically redenominated all shares of class B common stock outstanding at the amendment date as class B-1 common stock with no changes to the par value, conversion features, rights or privileges. All references to class B common stock outstanding prior to January 23, 2024 have been updated in this report to class B-1 common stock to reflect this redenomination. The amendments also authorized new classes of class B common stock that will only be issuable in connection with an exchange offer where a preceding class of B common stock is tendered in exchange and retired.

Class B-1 common stock exchange offer. In May 2024, Visa accepted 241 million shares of class B-1 common stock tendered in the exchange offer. In exchange, Visa issued approximately 120 million shares of class B-2 common stock and 48 million shares of class C common stock. The class B-1 common shares exchanged have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. Future conversion rate adjustments for the class B-2 common stock will have double the impact compared to conversion rate adjustments for the class B-1 common stock.

Note 12—Income Taxes

For the three months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the effective income tax rates were 17% and 19%, respectively. The effective income tax rates differ due to various items including a change in the geographic mix of earnings.

For the three months ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased $93 million, and the Company’s net unrecognized tax benefits increased $12 million. The change in unrecognized tax benefits is related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions, including an increase in gross timing differences.

The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations and refund claims are uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.

Note 13—Legal Matters

The Company is a party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. For those proceedings where a loss is determined to be only reasonably possible or probable but not estimable, the Company has disclosed the nature of the claim. Additionally, unless otherwise disclosed below with respect to these proceedings, the Company cannot provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties.

The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date.

The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation:

Accrual Summary—U.S. Covered Litigation

Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation. An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the Company’s litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.

The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to U.S. covered litigation:

| | | | | | | | | | |

| | |   
Payments for U.S. covered litigation| — | | | (160)|

Balance as of end of period

| $| 1,564 | | | $| 1,461 |

For the three months ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded an additional accrual of $27 million to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The accrual balance is consistent with the Company’s best estimate of its share of a probable and reasonably estimable loss with respect to the U.S. covered litigation. While this estimate is consistent with the Company’s view of the current status of the litigation, the probable and reasonably estimable loss or range of such loss could materially vary based on developments in the litigation. The Company will continue to consider and reevaluate this estimate in light of the substantial uncertainties with respect to the litigation. The Company is unable to estimate a potential loss or range of loss, if any, at trial if negotiated resolutions cannot be reached.

Accrual Summary—VE Territory Covered Litigation

Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. See further discussion below under VE Territory Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.

The complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 in failing to disclose that Visa was in violation of U.S. federal antitrust laws, as was alleged in the lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice on September 24, 2024 (see U.S. Department of Justice matter). The plaintiff seeks a ruling that this case may proceed as a class action, and seeks damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs.

The complaint claims that Visa has failed to enforce its rules prohibiting merchants from surcharging those transactions, and that plaintiff and putative class members have been harmed as a result. Plaintiff asserts breach of contract, unjust enrichment and unfair competition claims, and seeks monetary damages, declaratory and injunctive relief.

U.S. ATM Access Fee Litigation

ITEM 2.| Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, us, our or the Company) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 1—Financial Statements of this report.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that relate to, among other things, the impact on our future financial position, results of operations and cash flows; prospects, developments, strategies and growth of our business; anticipated expansion of our products in certain countries; industry developments; anticipated timing and benefits of our acquisitions; expectations regarding litigation matters, investigations and proceedings; timing and amount of stock repurchases; sufficiency of sources of liquidity and funding; effectiveness of our risk management programs; and expectations regarding the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Forward-looking statements generally are identified by words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “projects,” “could,” “should,” “will,” “continue” and other similar expressions. All statements other than statements of historical fact could be forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made, are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. We describe risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended September 30, 2024, and any subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Except as required by law, we do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

(2)For a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results, see tables in Non-GAAP financial results below.

Highlights. For the three months ended December 31, 2024, net revenue increased 10% over the prior year, primarily due to the growth in processed transactions, nominal cross-border volume and nominal payments volume, partially offset by higher client incentives. For the three months ended December 31, 2024, exchange rate movements did not have a material impact on net revenue growth. See Results of Operations—Net Revenue below for further discussion.

For the three months ended December 31, 2024, GAAP operating expenses increased 22% over the prior year, primarily driven by higher personnel and general and administrative expenses. See Results of Operations—Operating Expenses below for further discussion. For the three months ended December 31, 2024, exchange rate movements negatively impacted our operating expenses by approximately one percentage point.

For the three months ended December 31, 2024, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 11% over the prior year, primarily driven by higher personnel and general and administrative expenses.

Acquisition. In December 2024, we acquired Featurespace Limited (Featurespace), a developer of real-time artificial intelligence payments protection technology that prevents and mitigates payments fraud and financial crime risks, for a purchase consideration of $946 million. See Note 2—Acquisitions to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Interchange multidistrict litigation. For the three months ended December 31, 2024, we recorded an additional accrual of $27 million to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Common stock repurchases. For the three months ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased 13 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $3.9 billion. As of December 31, 2024, our share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $9.1 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance.

•Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business.

•Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as technology, customer relationships and trade names acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance.

•Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. These costs also include retention equity and deferred compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business.

•Severance costs. For the three months ended December 31, 2024, we recorded severance costs within personnel expense to realign our organizational structure and focus on areas that will drive higher long-term growth. This broad-based optimization effort has been excluded as it is not representative of our ongoing operations.

•Lease consolidation costs. For the three months ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a charge within general and administrative expense associated with the consolidation of certain leased office spaces. We have excluded these amounts as it does not reflect the underlying performance of our business.

•Litigation provision. Litigation provision includes significant accruals related to certain legal matters that are not covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan or the Europe retrospective responsibility plan (uncovered legal matters) and additional accruals associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation which are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan (U.S. covered litigation). Litigation provision associated with these matters can vary significantly based on the facts and circumstances related to each matter and do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. For the three months ended December 31, 2024, we have excluded this amount to facilitate a comparison to our past operating performance.

Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a downward adjustment to the rate at which shares of our class B-1 and class B-2 common stock ultimately convert into shares of class A common stock. For the three months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, there was no conversion rate adjustment. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Payments volume and processed transactions. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenue, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenue.

Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY and Interlink brands and excludes Europe co-badged volume. Nominal payments volume is denominated in U.S. dollars and is calculated each quarter by applying an established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volumes are reported. Processed transactions include payments and cash transactions, and represent transactions using cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY, Interlink and PLUS brands processed on Visa’s networks.

The following table presents nominal payments and cash volume:

(1)Service revenue in a given quarter is primarily assessed based on nominal payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenue reported for the three months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material.

(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.

Net revenue increased over the three-month prior-year comparable period primarily due to the growth in processed transactions, nominal cross-border volume and nominal payments volume, partially offset by higher client incentives.

Our net revenue is impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenue denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. For the three months ended December 31, 2024, exchange rate movements did not have a material impact on net revenue growth.

(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.

•Service revenue increased over the three-month prior-year comparable period primarily due to 6% growth in nominal payments volume.

•Data processing revenue increased over the three-month prior-year comparable period primarily due to 11% growth in processed transactions.

•International transaction revenue increased over the three-month prior-year comparable period primarily due to growth in nominal cross-border volumes of 15%, excluding transactions within Europe.

•Other revenue increased over the three-month prior-year comparable period primarily due to growth in consulting and marketing services and select pricing modifications.

•Client incentives increased over the three-month prior-year comparable period primarily due to growth in payments volume. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.

For the three months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, revenue from value-added services was $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. Value-added services revenue increased 17% primarily due to growth in consulting and marketing services, issuing solutions and risk and identity solutions.

(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.

•Personnel expenses increased over the three-month prior-year comparable period primarily due to severance costs in the current period to realign our organizational structure and a higher number of employees and compensation focused on areas that will drive higher long-term growth, including acquisitions.

•Network and processing expenses increased over the three-month prior-year comparable period primarily due to continued technology and processing network investments to support growth.

•Depreciation and amortization increased over the three-month prior-year comparable period primarily due to additional amortization and depreciation from our on-going investments and acquisitions.

•General and administrative expenses increased over the three-month prior-year comparable period primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, lease consolidation costs in the current period and higher usage of travel related card benefits.

•Litigation provision increased over the three-month prior-year comparable period primarily due to the accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation in the current period. See Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Non-operating Income (Expense)

(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.

•Investment income (expense) and other decreased over the three-month prior-year comparable period primarily due to losses on our equity investments and lower interest income on our cash and investments.

Effective Income Tax Rate

The following table presents our effective income tax rates:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

December 31,  
| | | | | | 2024| | 2023  
Effective income tax rate| | | | | | 17 | %| | 19 | %

The effective income tax rate decreased over the three-month prior-year comparable period due to various items including a change in the geographic mix of earnings.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published administrative guidance around the implementation of a 15% global minimum tax (Pillar Two). Various OECD member countries have either enacted or are in the process of enacting Pillar Two legislation. While we do not expect a material tax impact in fiscal 2025, we are monitoring developments and evaluating the potential impact of Pillar Two on future years.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented:

| | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

Investing activities| $| 790 | | | $| (1,889)|   
Financing activities| $| (5,475)| | | $| (4,379)|   
| | |   
| | |

Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities increased over the three-month prior-year comparable period primarily due to growth in our underlying business and the timing of payments related to income taxes.

Investing activities. Cash provided by investing activities increased over the three-month prior-year comparable period primarily due to the absence of investment security purchases and higher proceeds from investment security sales and maturities, partially offset by cash paid for an acquisition in the current period.

Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities increased over the three-month prior-year comparable period primarily due to lower funds held on behalf of clients, higher share repurchases and higher dividends paid.

Sources of Liquidity

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances.

There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2024, except as discussed below.

Common stock repurchases. For the three months ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $3.9 billion. As of December 31, 2024, our share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $9.1 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Dividends. For the three months ended December 31, 2024, we declared and paid $1.2 billion in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On January 28, 2025, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.59 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of all other outstanding common and preferred stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Senior notes. A principal payment on our senior notes of $4.0 billion is due in December 2025 for which we have sufficient liquidity. See Note 7—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Acquisition. In December 2024, we acquired Featurespace for a purchase consideration of $946 million. See Note 2—Acquisitions to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. This standard also enhances interim disclosure requirements and provides new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment. This ASU is effective for our annual periods beginning October 1, 2024, and interim periods beginning October 1, 2025, and requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented. We are currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on our disclosures.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, which provides improvements to income tax disclosures. This standard requires disaggregated information related to the effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. This ASU is effective for our annual periods beginning October 1, 2025, and requires prospective application with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on our disclosures.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, which requires disclosure of additional information about specific expense categories underlying certain income statement expense line items. Subsequently, the FASB also issued an amendment to this standard. The amendments in the ASU are effective for our annual periods beginning October 1, 2027, and interim periods beginning October 1, 2028, and require either prospective or retrospective application. We are currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on our disclosures.
