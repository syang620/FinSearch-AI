## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Timothy Chiodo (UBS)**: Great. Thank you for taking the question. There were some helpful comments around the e-commerce strength within cross-border offsetting some of the travel
weakness. When we think about the components of overall cross-border, clearly, there's the traditional travel, so card present and card not present. And then
there's the traditional e-commerce, right, so retail e-commerce. But there are other faster growing but smaller portions, whether it be the remittances or
marketplace payouts or you gave the Thunes example earlier. I was wondering if you could maybe size the, in aggregate, how large some of those other maybe
faster growing portions of cross-border have become as a part of the overall mix?

**Chris Suh (CFO)**: Yeah, sure. Why don't I start? Yeah, we don't have specifics to break-out. As we talked about, the e-commerce business has been strong. It continues to grow
above what we expected. The yields across our entire cross-border business are positive and accretive to Visa overall. And so we're happy with all flavors of
cross-border, but I don't have a further breakout for you in terms of the pieces that you were asking about.

### Exchange 002

**Bryan Bergin (Cowen)**: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to ask on new flows, so a nice recovery there in growth. Can you give a comment on what areas were most pronounced
in the underlying growth recovery relative to what you saw last quarter?

**Chris Suh (CFO)**: Yeah. Let me talk about Q2 growth. The two pieces of information that we gave you in terms of Q2 growth. We saw commercial volume growth globally 8%,
stable to Q1 and in fact, stable over the last several quarters. And we saw very strong growth in Visa direct transactions, growing 31% for the quarter. New flows
revenue in total growing 14%, which was in line with our expectations that we shared with you at the start of the year. I think the recovery that you're referencing
to was because Q1 growth was lower and that was really due to some lapping issues that were one-time and non-recurring, which we passed at this point.

### Exchange 003

**Will Nance (Goldman Sachs)**: Hey, guys. I appreciate you taking the question. A bit of a dual-part question on just some of the prior guidance commentary you made around first-half versus
second-half dynamics and some of the drivers of acceleration over the course of the year. And I guess specifically, I guess, incentives, you talked about a
step-down in the growth rate from first half to second half. Is that still your expectation despite that coming in a lot lower in the most recent quarter? And then for
the similar question on the volume growth trends, I guess, I hear you on the Asia trends, but I guess overall, you had some kind of upbeat commentary on ticket
sizes over the course of the year and kind of easing inflation in comps, it seems like gas prices might help that as well. So just any commentary on ticket sizes
and specifically the negative ticket sizes you've seen in the US? Any commentary on kind of what's structural versus kind of more environmental there? Thanks.

**Chris Suh (CFO)**: Yeah. Okay. Let me start first with incentives, the first part of your question. So, as you all have seen from quarter-to-quarter, incentive growth can vary based on
a number of factors, client performance, deal timing, which is what caused half one to come in lower than anticipated. For our outlook for the second half of the
year, our expectations remain largely unchanged. We still expect year-over-year growth to be lower in the second half than in the first half as we lap the higher
incentives that we saw starting in the second half of last year. And we do expect the Q4 incentive growth rate will be the lowest growth quarter of the year. So
expectations for half two are unchanged. To your second question on ATS, let me -- there's a lot of moving parts in here. And so maybe I'm just going to kind of
go through it in detail and unpack bit by bit. Globally, Q2 ATS year-over-year growth was down slightly, which is consistent with the growth that we saw in Q1.
Breaking that apart between the US and international. In the US, ticket size growth actually continued to improve from Q1 to Q2, still slightly negative, but the
trend improved from Q1 to Q2. And looking ahead in the US, this is something that we've spoken to previously, we do continue to expect ATS will turn positive in
the second half of this year as we lap the lower ticket sizes in the second half of last year. Internationally, outside of Asia-Pacific, let's set that aside for a second,
we saw improvement in several regions, including the impact from higher inflation in several markets. And so overall, excluding Asia, we still expect ATS to turn
positive in the second half based on the expected improvements in the US with the impact of Asia factored in, global ATS will be slightly negative and that was
factored into the revised payment volume outlook that I gave for the full year.

### Exchange 004

**Trevor Williams (Jefferies)**: Great. Thanks a lot. This one is for Ryan. Just wanted to go back to the merchant settlement in the US, clearly you guys aren't directly impacted by lower
interchange, but I'm just curious kind of what you're expecting the downstream impact to be on Visa, the relationships between you and your issuing banks. And if
you think it in any way kind of changes the competitive dynamics at all within the US credit market? Thanks.
Ryan McInerney
Thanks, Trevor. I think the good news on this front is it brings clarity and stability to the market. This is litigation that's been out there for the better part of 20 years
or so. I think there's been a lot of great work that's been done to bring this to a resolution. Just to remind everyone what the main planks of the resolution are. It
really is two different sets of things. One is it will reduce interchange for US -- for credit cards in the US market for both Visa and Mastercard and it will have no
increases in interchange for the five years of the agreement. And then the second set of things are tools that give merchants more flexibility to how they manage
payments significant -- specifically as it relates to surcharging and things like that. I think, overall, it's what I said, Trevor, which is clarity and stability that lets
everybody who operates in the US market move on and move on continuing to grow the digitization of this great payments ecosystem that we've all collectively
built in the United States.

### Exchange 005

**Harshita Rawat (Bernstein)**: Good afternoon. So, Ryan, I want to follow up on value-added services, such an important part of your growth story. I know you've talked about the five types of 
services you offer and how your top 250 clients use almost 2x the number of services versus the rest of your client base. Can you give us some sense on how 
these penetration numbers have evolved over time? And finally as you kind of think about pricing for these services, to what extent it's a bundle pricing along with

core versus kind of a separately priced service? Thank you.
Ryan McInerney
Okay. You have a great memory. As we've said, our top 265 clients or so use on average about 22 of our value-added services. We don't talk about like how
that's moved quarter-to-quarter, but the opportunity is enormous just when you think about the number of clients we have around the planet. And so as I was
mentioning earlier kind of what we've done is we've armed our frontline teams with kind of client-by-client, what are they using, what are they not using, what are
the opportunities to create value for the client by putting value-added services A, B, C or D to work for them and we're having great success and you see that in
the numbers. In terms of the pricing, it's -- it's different pricing models for different products and different suites of solutions in different places around the world.
We're always trying to come up with the right product pricing mix that's going to work best for our products in the market. And we have a portfolio of value-added
services that span from issuing to acceptance to risk and identity to advisory into open banking and the competitive sets are deep and different in all of those
markets. So we're bringing different pricing approaches to each and every market around the world to help meet the best that we can for our clients.

**Chris Suh (CFO)**: Yeah. Thanks for the question. On the -- it's really the first of the things that you mentioned. Now, of course, we need to have great acceptance. We need to have
great capabilities and all those types of things, which we do in every market we operate around the planet. So then it becomes sitting down with clients, helping
them understand the value of, for example, a Visa debit card versus a card that runs primarily on domestic schemes. And then you get into e-commerce
capabilities that Visa Debit is able to provide their clients that maybe they don't get the same type of capabilities from the domestic scheme. You get to
cross-border travel opportunities that their customers would have if they were using a Visa card versus one of those domestic schemes that I mentioned. You also
get into the risk and fraud prevention capabilities that I mentioned earlier and the ability to have more transactions approved and lower fraud rates, tokenization, I
mean, all these kind of benefits, you've heard us talk about over and over again, those are what our teams can sit down with the clients and explain to them.
Often the clients will do some pilots and some tests, they'll see the results, they'll see higher spend, they'll see higher client satisfaction. And then ultimately the
decision to issue Visa cards to their clients becomes a very clear decision for them.

### Exchange 006

**Jason Kupferberg (Bank of America)**: Thank you, guys. Can you talk about your second half expectations for new flows and VAS revenue growth as well as cross-border travel volume growth?
Thanks.

**Chris Suh (CFO)**: Sure. Let me unpack that a little bit. From a -- as you heard us, we reaffirmed our prior year guide for the full year, adjusted net revenue growth, OpEx, EPS. And
within that, I spoke about the fact that volatility is going to cause our currency volatility -- treasury revenues in international to be lower than we anticipated in Q3.
But again full year unchanged within that. Our expectations for new flows in that are consistent with the ones that we shared at the beginning of the year, which
we anticipated. For the full year, new flows will grow faster than consumer payments with weighted toward faster growth in the second half of the year. We're
seeing that with the 14% growth in Q2. We anticipate continuing to see a good growth in the second half of the year. Value-added services has grown over 20%
in each of the first two quarters. The momentum there is pretty evident. The second part of your question was, I think, around cross-border travel of volumes in
total. So we did make a little bit of adjustment. You heard me talk about based on half-one trends. And so again, this is one with a couple of parts, so let's just go
through it in detail. First of all, we feel really good, feel great about our first-half total cross-border performance, 16% growth in Q2, in line with our expectations,
and within that, travel was 17% and e-commerce growth mid-teens better than expected. And so that unpacking travel a bit, we've seen most of our travel volume
expectations play out actually as we planned at the beginning of the year, which continues to be strong and healthy in most regions LAC, Europe, CEMEA and all
the ones that I talked about on the call, with Asia being the exception to that, which again continues to improve with the pace of recovery being slower than
expected, offset again by strength in the e-commerce cross-border business, which is performing better than we expected.So we expect these trends to continue
into the second half and thus, we've moderated our outlook for travel due to AP and upped our expectations on e-commerce. So putting that all together, overall,
our view is that total cross-border volumes remain strong, growing in the mid-teens in the second half, which is frankly the better measure in relation to our
financial performance given the strong yields across both travel and e-commerce.
