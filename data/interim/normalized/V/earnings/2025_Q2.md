## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**James Faucette (Morgan Stanley)**: Thank you so much. Wanted to ask about what you're seeing around our bookings around international travel and travel generally. You highlighted there have
been a little bit of slowing growth there, maybe domestically, but overall still remained good and maybe impacted by FX, et cetera, but we've seen a lot of FX
moves. So just wondering how you're feeling about the travel outlook on a go-forward basis and anything you can glean from early bookings, et cetera? Thanks.
Ryan McInerney
Hi, James. Yeah. We covered a number of moving parts in our travel and cross-border business as it impacted Q2 and gave some assumptions about what we
anticipated going into the back-half of the year. I think I'll make two points. One is, obviously, the situation is quite fluid, and we're monitoring the data very closely,
and we're really relying on facts and facts and the results as we see them. But the second point maybe is even more important is that when we look across our
business, we talk about the diversity of our business across -- in many dimensions. Regional is one of them. But certainly, when we look at our cross-border
business, whether that's issued or acquired, we also benefit from that diversity. And when it comes to inbound travel into the US, the US specifically actually is
one of the smaller regions as measured by cross-border inbound travel volume, even though it does have strong yields. And so we just keep that in mind. We'll
have to watch how the data comes in, but we have great diversification in our cross-border business, and we anticipate that we'll be able to navigate this period.

**Jennifer Como (President)**: Next question.

### Exchange 002

**Will Nance (Goldman Sachs)**: Hey, guys. I appreciate you taking the question. Chris, I was wondering if you could double-click again on some of the comments you shared around the
incentives outlook. I think you've been talking about a pretty front-loaded renewal schedule. I thought -- I heard, but correct me if I'm wrong, the outlook is for
modest increases in the growth rate over the next two quarters, but I may have misheard that. But if that was the case, could you just talk through cadence and
some of the drivers, kind of help square that with the front-loaded renewals? Appreciate it. Thank you.

**Chris Suh (CFO)**: Sure, Will. Thanks for the question. You did hear correctly, and let me try to add a little bit of color and clarify. Q2 incentives grew 15%, came in lower than we
had anticipated, primarily due to factors related to deal timing. I covered that on the call. In terms of what we expect for the full year and into the second half of the
year, we've updated the expectation that in the back half of the year, our growth will be slightly higher than originally expected due to two factors that we called
out. One is client-related performance adjustments, and the second is deal timing, which means specifically anticipated early renewals. And so when we
reforecast the second-half of the year, we do expect the second-half to grow higher than the first-half of the year, and we do expect that sequentially to be Q3 a
little higher than Q2, and Q4 to be a little higher than Q3. And then maybe the final thing I'll say is, when we look at the volume -- payment volume that was
impacted by renewals, we still believe that we have the same expectation that we started the year, which is 20% of the payment volumes being impacted.

### Exchange 003

**Timothy Chiodo (UBS)**: Great. Thank you. Chris, I want to dig in a little bit more on the delta between nominal cross-border volumes and nominal international revenue. I think you did a
great job going through the items. But to recap, there's the FX volatility. There's the quarter and client mix, there is a pricing aspect. And then, of course, there's
the hedging, which impacts the revenue, but not the volumes. I think you touched on the FX volatility, meaning not assuming in the guide that the high levels will
persist, which is a good conservative approach. You talked around quarter mix and the yields being higher for US inbound. The one I was hoping you could drill in
a little bit more is pricing, because I know previously the guidance talked a little bit about pricing being a second-half of the fiscal year event. So, whether it'd be
specific to cross-border or for the whole business, maybe you could just touch a little bit on that pricing topic.

**Chris Suh (CFO)**: Sure. Hi, Tim. Yes, let me parse those apart a little bit. You covered my points on international transaction revenue. As you pointed out, we grew 10%, which was 
in line with the nominal volume growth, but below the 13% constant-currency, that's the impact of FX. And I covered a number of items that impacted that, in

addition to FX, higher volatility, and some offsets there that you mentioned. Happy to give you more color on those. But let me hit to your second point, which is
our expectations on the full-year on pricing. Just to remind everyone, at the start of the year, we said we would anticipate that the pricing contribution to growth in
the full year would be similar to the previous year, but the timing would be a little bit different, where we'd have more back-end loaded pricing. That's still our
expectation. We don't have a different view. We do believe that pricing will benefit in the second half more than it did in the first half of this year.

### Exchange 004

**Jason Kupferberg (Bank of America)**: Thank you, guys. Wanted to ask about US volume growth. I know we went from 6% in the March quarter to 8% month-to-date. So I'm just curious if you normalize
for effects of Easter, and I know, Chris, you mentioned a little bit of pull-forward to spend ahead of the tariffs. Should we be just assuming some moderation off
the April levels of 8%, given those factors? Just want to make sure we've got the modeling square there, so we don't over extrapolate from a few weeks of data.
Thanks.

**Chris Suh (CFO)**: Yes. Good question, Jason. It's -- the overall environment, I'll go back to some of the comments Ryan made, the overall comment, the overall environment
remains stable, healthy, and steady. Whenever we give the month-to-date data, I always disclaim it by saying two or three weeks, or three weeks in this case,
don't make a trend. We'll have to see how the rest of the quarter plays out. The 8% in the month-to-date does reflect some benefits from the timing of Easter. I
called that out earlier in the comments. We'll have to see how the quarter comes together. But I think the overall message that I would convey is that it's stable
and the consumer remains resilient, and I wouldn't read too much into the six versus eight at this point.

### Exchange 005

**Bryan Keane (Deutsche Bank)**: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just want to ask about the entertainment weakness where you saw that exactly, and do you expect that to continue
going forward? And was just thinking about the different affluent group, maybe growing faster versus other bands, and just the outlook there. Thanks.

**Chris Suh (CFO)**: Yes. A couple of things I'd point to. One is, trends sort of triangulating around the data. The most important thing I think to keep in mind is that when we see --
when we talked about discretionary versus non-discretionary, they were both quite strong and healthy relative to the previous quarter. And so within that, we did
have some puts and takes. I mentioned some travel and entertainment, but also offset by retail goods, as an example. And so there are puts and takes, there are
some moving parts within that, but overall, healthy stable volumes, whether it's discretionary or non-discretionary. And as Ryan pointed out, even as we look
across spend bands, the consistency of the performance in previous quarters, while obviously, higher spend bands are growing faster than they have been for
several quarters, the quarter-on-quarter performance remains stable and consistent.

### Exchange 006

**Adam Frisch (Evercore)**: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. My extrapolation of your guidance is, if there's a little bit of weakness, kind of just more related to cyclicality as opposed to
anything more crazy, you guys can absorb that, correct me if I'm wrong on that assumption. But if macro conditions shift materially and much more quickly than
expected, can you remind us where your key levers are in terms of revenue like pricing or cost management in terms of marketing and stuff that would allow you
to keep pace with the rate of change if it were to be faster and protect your margins? Thanks.
Ryan McInerney
Yes. Hi, Adam. I touched on some of these points a little bit ago, but let me just expand on them because I think it's sort of an interesting way to think about it.
Obviously, every recession is different. But over the course of time and over history, Visa has proven to be quite resilient even during these economic downturns.
We don't know what's going to happen. We're not economic forecasters. But the management team here is ready to move decisively should the need arise. Now
our business is resilient. I talked about the diversification of the business, more exposure to everyday spend, more exposure to debit, even our cross-border
volume is more e-commerce today than travel than it was, if I think about pre-COVID levels. And so that diversification helps us. And so if there was a downturn, I
think our performance during this potential economic slowdown we would be resilient, and it can impact our business. If you think about it, between volumes and
revenue, volumes historically grown faster than PC. Even if PC slows, we're confident that we can continue to grow faster than that for all the reasons I spoke
about. And then the one other thing I'd add is on the revenue front, remember that incentives are largely variable. And so to the extent that volume growth does
get impacted, there could be an offset on incentives. On the expense side, I think we've also historically shown we could flex our expenses. We could make -- we
obviously want to balance between short and near-term and long-term priorities. We don't want to overreact to anything. We want to be thoughtful about making
sure that we're investing in the right areas to ensure that Visa is successful over the long term, but we do have levers, and this is a management team that stands
ready to act.

**Jennifer Como (President)**: Next question.

Next, we'll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Ramsey El-Assal
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Stablecoin seem to be having their moment, maybe helped along by clear regulations. I know you called out your strategy
there, including this -- reaching $200 million of settlement flows. What are your latest thoughts on the demand for those stablecoin settlements or other stablecoin
payments? Are you seeing or expecting an inflection? What are your clients saying? Thanks.
Ryan McInerney
It's still early, but we do see real potential, which is why we've been investing in the crypto space broadly in the stablecoin space specifically for many years now.
We've built up a team of real experts that I think are very well-respected among the ecosystem. But it's early. On the one hand, $200 million is a great kind of
milestone. On the other hand, it's still a relatively very small portion of our overall settlement volume. I guess I'd say a couple of things. One is, we are optimistic
about the kind of the US government passing more clear and pragmatic regulations. I think not just in the US, but hopefully other countries as well. We are
continuing to push forward with the settlement work that you mentioned, but we're also exploring an kind of a broader set of product opportunities and
partnerships in the stablecoin space. I might use that as a little bit of a pitch to join our product drop tomorrow, which I mentioned in my prepared remarks, but our
team will talk about some of those things as well. So as you said, there's a lot of activity and discussion about the stablecoin space right now. I think the tipping
point will be more clear and pragmatic regulations. But I do think in the big scheme of things, certainly as it relates to our broader business, it's still very early in
the development.

### Exchange 007

**Harshita Rawat (Bernstein)**: Good afternoon. Ryan, Visa has managed government nationalism risk for decades as a company. How do you think about navigating that risk in the current
environment, being a US-based company operating globally during trade disputes? Thank you.
Ryan McInerney
Thanks. If I heard your question right, around how are we navigating all of this? We regularly engage with governments and regulators in every country where we
operate. We have a like a world-class government engagement team in all of our regions and all of our major countries, but it's also our country managers, day-in
and day-out, they are deeply engaged with the governments and the countries in which we operate because we are an extraordinarily important partner and
company in every country we operate around the world. And our engagement now is -- it's important. It's as important as it's ever been, given the challenging and
uncertain environment that you mentioned. What I would say is nationalism is nothing new. As long as we are permitted to operate in a country or territory, even if
it's been more difficult for us to operate there than it has historically, we have a proven track record of being successful. We're used to operating in highly
regulated markets and environments around the world. We've got tailored strategies, which we've tested in other markets with similar conditions, and we tailor
those to the unique needs of our clients and our partners in every one of these markets. And we're working with our clients and partners to regularly educate the
government and the regulators and the elected officials in those countries about not just what matters most kind of domestically in their market, but the
complexities of the global payments market and what we need to be doing together to help them in their markets. So it is as complicated as I remember it, but we
have the experience, the people, the products and services to put to work in these countries around the world, and we feel good about our ability to navigate it.

**Jennifer Como (President)**: And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team. Thanks
again and have a great day.
