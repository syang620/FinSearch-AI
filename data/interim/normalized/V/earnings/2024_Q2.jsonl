Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's fiscal second quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us today are Ryan McInerney, Visa's Chief\nExecutive Officer; and Chris Suh, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A\nreplay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website. Let me also remind\nyou that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results could differ\nmaterially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any\nsubsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For non-GAAP financial\ninformation disclosed on this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release and related materials available on our\nIR website. And with that, let me turn the call over to Ryan.\nRyan McInerney\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We delivered strong second quarter results with $8.8 billion in net revenue up 10%, GAAP EPS up 12% and \nnon-GAAP EPS up 20%. For our key business drivers, we saw relative stability. Overall payments volume grew 8% year-over-year in constant dollars, US \npayment volume grew 6% year-over-year and international payments volume grew 11%. Cross-border volume excluding Intra-Europe rose 16% year-over-year \nand process transactions grew 11%. Visa's business performance demonstrates our strategy at work in consumer payments, new flows, and value-added \nservices. Furthermore, across all of these growth levers, tremendous opportunity remains. I'll spend a few moments on each growth lever. Let's start with \nconsumer payments. The opportunity in consumer payments is enormous. Based on the latest public data from calendar year 2022 and our analysis, we estimate \nthat the total global purchase personal consumption expenditure or PPCE excluding Russia and China was approximately $40 trillion. Within that $40 trillion, our \naddressable opportunity is more than $20 trillion. This includes three components. One, cash and check, which is about half of the addressable opportunity. \nTap-to-pay is a great example of how we are converting small ticket cash transactions to Visa credentials. Two, ACH and other electronic transactions. We have \nmany examples in this space, including the work we are doing to extend Visa as a bill pay method in acceptance categories like rent, education and loan \nrepayments. And three, cards that run primarily on domestic networks. We have been focused on converting these domestic based cards to Visa credentials in \ncountries around the world and I'll share a good example from Europe in a moment. There is a very long runway ahead and I remain excited about Visa's future \ngrowth opportunity in consumer payments. We continue to capture that growth by delivering innovative and secure payment solutions for buyers and sellers, \nincluding new credentials and issuance, tap-to-pay and e-commerce. I'll briefly talk about each. First, we're making great progress in expanding the number of \nVisa credentials. We have added over 100 million credentials from September to December for a year-over-year growth rate of 6%. One area of focus is in \nEurope. With the UK growing credentials at its fastest rate since 2016, driven in part by strong growth from fintech clients. In addition, from 2018 to 2023, we \nconverted more than 20 million credentials in Europe that primarily ran on domestic networks to Visa debit credentials with millions more in the process of being \nmigrated. This is a great example of the opportunity I mentioned a moment ago. We're particularly excited as we prepare for the Paris Olympics, which are less \nthan 100 days away. We have close to 300 clients across 85 countries globally working with Visa to activate our Olympic sponsorship for marketing campaigns \nand cardholder engagements such as credential issuance and onsite cardholder events. And in Europe alone, we expect our clients to have issued over 5 million \nOlympic and Paralympic branded Visa credentials before the start of the games. Also this quarter in Europe, we renewed our relationship with Caixa Geral de \nDepositos in Portugal across consumer credit, debit and prepaid and commercial credit and debit as well as a suite of value-added services, including risk \nsolutions and analytics. Another area of strength is our co-brand issuance. Visa is the primary network partner for eight of the top 10 co-brand partnerships in the \nUS today and we are pleased that Visa has finalized a multi-year extension of our successful credit co-branded partnership with Alaska Airlines, a portfolio that \nbenefits from a loyal customer base and high cross-border usage. We have also had significant co-brand momentum in CEMEA. First, we launched a new \nco-brand card in partnership with Qatar Airways, British Airways and the National Bank of Kuwait. Second, we expanded our strong global Marriott relationship to \nlaunch Qatar's first hospitality co-branded card with Qatar Islamic Bank. Across the United Arab Emirates, we now have exclusive agreements with all the leading \nairlines marked by a recent agreement with Emirates Skywards. And we also signed an inaugural Airline co-brand agreement in Morocco with Royal Air Maroc. \nNow newer digital issuers are equally important to our future growth in consumer payments. And in Saudi Arabia, fintech stc pay, which has over 12 million \ncustomers is transitioning from a digital wallet to a full digital bank and expanding its Visa prepay business into Visa debit and credit. Digital Bank Maya in the \nPhilippines has chosen Visa to offer its millions of mobile wallet users and bank depositors access to consumer credit cards with new issuance of affluent \nproducts. In the US, we signed a newly expanded credit deal with brokerage platform Robinhood, including the launch of a new Robinhood Gold Card, which \noffers 3% cashback for all purchases. In Europe, broker and savings platform Trade Republic has launched a new Visa card that combines spending and savings \nfor their 4 million customers across 17 markets. Over 1 million people joined the waitlist for the card in just a few weeks. As I've mentioned in the past, we feel \ngreat about our products, our value-added services, our new flows capabilities, our brand, and our people, all coming together to deepen and expand our \npartnerships with our clients around the world. As we think about Visa's growth, tap-to-pay and e-commerce are key drivers in the digitization of payments. This \nquarter, tap-to-pay grew five percentage points from last year to 79% of face-to-face transactions globally, excluding the US. Of note, Japan nearly doubled its \npenetration since last year to almost 30%. In the US, in the second quarter, we're nearing 50% penetration with New York City at over 75%. The first US city to \nreach this milestone up from 50% two years ago, demonstrating the impact that transit and our focused issuance and acceptance have on accelerating growth. \nOn the e-commerce front, we continued to see Visa's US e-commerce payments volume grow several points faster year-over-year than face-to-face spend. And \nthe same is true in many key countries around the world, including Canada, Brazil, Australia and India. And this matters to Visa's growth because in the \ne-commerce space, cash is not usually an option. And although e-commerce payments are a highly competitive environment, we believe our capabilities and our \nfocus on safety, security, reliability, and user experience position us very well. Adding to the potential for growth is tokenization, which brings several benefits to \nthe ecosystem, especially in e-commerce, including reducing fraud, improving authorization rates and therefore making it easier for a customer to purchase a \ngood or service. As of the second quarter, we have over 9.5 billion tokens globally and have surpassed a milestone of 1 billion tokens in Asia-Pacific joining the \nranks of the US and Europe. We continue to be focused across all of these efforts in addition to seeking new areas of acceptance and spending. Now moving to\n\nnew flows. We mentioned last quarter that we see $200 trillion of opportunity excluding Russia and China and we are delivering Visa's commercial and money\nmovement solutions to help digitize these flows. This quarter, new flows revenue growth improved to 14% year-over-year on a constant dollar basis with Visa\nDirect overall transactions growing 31% for the quarter to $2.3 billion and commercial volumes up 8% year-over-year in constant dollars. Throughout the quarter,\nwe remain focused on our Visa Direct strategy across several areas of growth, including through new use cases, expansion to new geographies and enablers.\nOne recent example is our expanded agreement with Thunes, which increased the number of countries in which Visa Direct can enable push-to-wallet from 78 to\n108. In addition, Thunes is implementing Visa Direct's push-to-card capability to enable payouts made to eligible Visa cards and accounts. We have also\nexpanded earned wage access in Canada through an agreement with Payfare and have brought our first Visa Direct cross-border capability into Taiwan with\nTaishin Bank. On the enabler front, we are pleased that our long-time partner JPMorgan Payments will be seamlessly integrating Visa Direct into their acquiring\noperations to offer their business clients faster push payments capabilities. In addition, we continued to deepen our relationship with Chase in the small business\nmarket with investment and enhancements in products and services. And in accounts receivable and payable, we renewed and expanded our multi-year\nagreement with Bill on their accounts payable, spend and expense management platforms. We have also reached a global partnership with Taulia, an SAP\ncompany and a leading provider of working capital management solutions. The collaboration will incorporate Visa's digital payments technology into Taulia's\nvirtual cards, a solution that integrates with SAP ERP solutions and business applications to make embedded finance accessible for businesses through a\nseamless and streamlined payments experience for buyers and suppliers. One vertical in new flows that has immense potential is government payments,\nrepresenting over $15 trillion in annual payments volume opportunity, where we are in a strong position to combine many of our new flows offerings. A recent\nexample is in Kenya, where we signed an agreement with Pesaflow, a technology partner for the government of Kenya to expand card payments on eCitizen, the\ngovernment's electronic platform with over 12 million users. We achieved this by bringing together Visa Virtual credentials and Visa Direct into the platform. Now\nlet me move on to value-added services, where revenue was up 23% in the second quarter in constant dollars. The growth and opportunity in value-added\nservices continue to be significant and broad-based. In Acceptance Solutions, we signed an agreement with Millicom International Cellular in Latin America for\ncybersource gateway, decision manager and token management solutions. As it relates to open banking, just about two years ago, we acquired Tink as we saw\nthe opportunity in open banking to enable the movement of data and money and to provide consumers with control over their financial data. Over those two years,\nwe have been expanding our presence in Europe, winning deals with such as Adyen and Revolut. We're now expanding open banking solutions through Tink into\nthe United States having signed several data access agreements, including with Capital One, Fiserv, and Jack Henry, so that their customers may share data\nwith Tink. We've also signed partnerships on the fintech and merchant side including Dwolla and Max Rewards. And across our risk offerings, we continue to\nbolster them through our technology, innovation and AI expertise and are expanding their utility beyond the Visa network. Recently, we announced three such\ncapabilities in our Visa Protect offering. The first is the expansion of our signature solutions Visa Advanced Authorization and Visa Risk Manager for non-VISA\ncard payments making them network agnostic. This allows issuers to simplify their fraud operations into a single fraud detection solution. The second is the\nrelease of Visa Protect for account-to-account payments, our first fraud prevention solution built specifically for real-time payments, including P2P digital wallets,\naccount-to-account transactions and Central Bank's instant payment systems. Powered by AI-based fraud detection models, this new service provides a real-time\nrisk score that can be used to identify fraud on account-to-account payments. We've been piloting both of these in a number of countries and our strong results\nthus far have informed our decision to roll these out globally. The third solution is Visa Deep Authorization. It is a new transaction risk scoring solution tailored\nspecifically to the US market to better manage e-commerce payments powered by a world-class deep learning recurrent neural network model and petabytes of\ncontextual data. We also continue to make our offerings available through third-party platforms. We mentioned ServiceNow last quarter and we are excited to\nhave recently joined the AWS Partner Network to help seamlessly provide our clients running systems in the cloud access to Visa's solutions, initially starting with\nCurrencycloud, now known as Visa Cross-Border Solutions and Pismo. We also signed an agreement with Stripe for them to distribute Verify solutions through a\nself-service dispute management platform for their merchants. All of these efforts are part of our strategy to build and offer our solutions for both Visa and our\nnetwork of networks. Before I hand it to Chris, I wanted to note that we have commenced the exchange offer for Visa's Class B1 common stock that is set to\nexpire at the end of next week. I also wanted to highlight that this quarter, after nearly 20 years of litigation, we have agreed to a landmark settlement with US\nmerchants, more than 90% of which are small businesses, lowering credit interchange rates and capping those rates into 2030 once approved by the court. The\ninjunctive relief class settlement also provides updates to several key network rules, giving merchants more choice in how they accept digital payments. Last, let\nme share a few closing thoughts on the quarter and beyond. First, our second quarter was marked by stable results and strengthened relationships with clients\nacross the globe. Second, as we head into the back half of our fiscal year and beyond, new flows and value-added services remain key areas of focus. We also\nsee significant opportunity in consumer payments by digitizing cash and check, enhancing our capabilities in e-commerce, and building new solutions for our\nnetwork of networks. I could not be more excited for what lies ahead. Finally, all of this is possible because of the 30,000 Visa employees who come to work\nevery day in service of our clients and partners, I am grateful for everything that you do, thank you. And now over to Chris.", "char_count": 15483, "word_count": 2431, "token_count": 3086, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "V_TRANSCRIPT_2024_Q2_u_0000", "company": "V", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2024, "period": "2024-Q2", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/V/V_FY2024_Q2.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}
{"doc_id": "V_TRANSCRIPT_2024_Q2", "ticker": "V", "quarter": "Q2", "filing_date": "2024-06-01", "phase": "qa", "speaker_name": "Chris Suh", "speaker_role": "CFO", "speaker_firm": null, "utterance_id": "u_0001", "utterance_type": "answer", "text": "Thanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. As Ryan said, Q2 was a strong quarter with relatively stable growth across payments volume, process transactions, \nand cross-border volume. Looking at our drivers, in constant dollars, global payments volume was up 8% year-over-year and process transactions grew 11% \nyear-over-year. Cross-border volume growth excluding Intra-Europe was up 16% year-over-year in constant dollars. Fiscal second quarter net revenue was up \n10% in nominal and constant dollars, which was slightly above our expectations, primarily due to lower-than-expected incentives and better-than-expected \nvalue-added services revenue that collectively more than offset lower-than-expected currency volatility. GAAP EPS was up 12% and non-GAAP EPS was up 20% \nin nominal and 21% in constant dollars. So let's go into the details, starting with total payments volume. Global payments volume growth in Q2 was 8%, \nconsistent with Q1 growth. There are a couple of things I'd like to highlight when comparing Q2 to Q1. First, the extra day for the leap year was a benefit to the \nquarter. This was offset primarily by slowing payments volume growth in Asia-Pacific mostly due to macroeconomic weakness in Mainland China. When we \nadjust for Asia and some other smaller factors, we see second quarter global payments volume growth generally in line with the first quarter. Now on to the US. \nUS payments volume grew 6% year-over-year, credit grew 6% and debit grew 6%. Card present spend grew 4% and card not present volume grew 8%. Reg II \nhad a similar modest impact in Q2 as we saw in Q1. When we normalize for leap year, we see relatively stable US payments volume growth. Consumer spend \nacross all segments from low to high spend has remained relatively stable. Our data does not indicate any meaningful behavior change across consumer \nsegments. Moving to international markets, where total payments volume growth was up 11% in constant dollars. Payments volume growth rates were strong for \nthe quarter in most major regions with Latin America, CEMEA, and Europe, ex-UK, each growing more than 19% in constant dollars. Normalized for leap year \nand weakness in Mainland China, total international payments volume growth was relatively stable to the first quarter. As a reminder, domestic volumes in \nMainland China drive a very small amount of revenue and therefore the impact to our financial statements is not significant. Now to cross-border, which I'll speak \nto in constant dollars and excluding Intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volumes were up a healthy 16% in Q2 generally in line with our expectations. \nCross-border card not present volume growth, excluding travel and adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases was in the mid-teens, stronger than expected. \nCross-border travel volume was up 17% or 152% indexed to 2019. Consistent with our expectations for the year, we continue to see strong travel volume growth \nin and out of LAC, Europe, and CEMEA and out of the US ranging from 158% to 192% of 2019 levels. The US inbound travel volume has continued to recover \nwithin our expectations up several points from Q1 versus 2019 levels. Asia-Pacific travel volume continues to recover, but the pace has been slower than we\n\nanticipated. Travel volume into Asia indexed at 142% of 2019 levels for the quarter, up eight points from Q1, while travel volume out of Asia was up two points to\n124% of 2019. We see the primary drivers being one, macroeconomic weakness in key markets like Australia and Mainland China two, weakness in some\nAsia-Pacific currencies, which is impacting consumer purchasing power, particularly for Japan and three, airline capacity that is still below 2019 levels, particularly\nthe Mainland China and North American corridor. Altogether, we're pleased with our total cross-border volume growth with e-commerce growth generally\noffsetting the travel weakness in Asia and this is a great testament to the strength and diversification of our model. Now let's review our second quarter financial\nresults starting with the revenue components. Both service revenue and data processing revenue grew generally in line with their underlying drivers, which\nresulted in their respective revenue yields remaining relatively consistent to the first quarter. Service revenue grew 7% year-over-year versus the 8% growth in Q1\nconstant dollar payments volume. Data processing revenue grew 12% versus the 11% process transaction growth. International transaction revenue was up 9%\nversus the 16% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe, impacted by lapping strong currency volatility from last year. As volatility\nreached lows that we haven't seen in about four years, the revenue growth was lower than we expected. Other revenue grew 37%, primarily driven by strong\nconsulting and marketing services revenue growth and to a lesser extent, pricing. Client incentives grew 12%, lower than we expected due to client performance\nand deal timing. Across our three growth engines, consumer payments growth was driven by relatively stable payments volume, process transactions and\ncross-border volume. New flows revenue improved as expected to 14% year-over-year growth in constant dollars. Visa Direct transactions improved to 31%\nyear-over-year growth helped by growth in Latin America for interoperability among P2P apps. Commercial volumes rose 8% year-over-year in constant dollars.\nIn Q2, value-added services revenue grew 23% in constant dollars to $2.1 billion, primarily driven by issuing and acceptance solutions and advisory services.\nGAAP operating expenses increased 29% driven by increases in the litigation provision and G&A expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 11% primarily\ndue to increases in G&A and personnel expenses. FX and Pismo each represented an approximately half point headwind. Excluding net losses from our equity\ninvestments of $30 million, non-GAAP non-operating income was $189 million. Our GAAP tax rate was 15.4% and our non-GAAP tax rate was 16% due to the\nresolution of some non-US tax matters. GAAP EPS was $2.29 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.51, up 20% over last year, inclusive of an almost one point drag from\nexchange rates and an approximately half point drag from Pismo. In Q2, we bought back approximately 2.7 billion in stock and distributed over 1 billion in\ndividends to our stockholders. At the end of March, we had 23.6 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Now, let's move to what we've seen so far in April\nthrough the 21st. US payments volume was up 4% with debit up 4% and credit up 5% year-over-year, down from March, primarily due to Easter timing. Process\ntransactions grew 9% year-over-year. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe grew 15% year-over-year. Travel-related\ncross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe grew 15% year-over-year in constant dollars or 151% indexed to 2019. And cross-border card not present ex-travel\ngrew 15% in constant dollars. Now on to our expectations. Remember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excluding\nacquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentations for more detail. Let's start with the full year. We are reaffirming our prior year\nguidance for the full year for adjusted net revenue and operating expense growth in the low-double-digits and EPS growth in the low-teens. As for drivers, things\nare progressing generally as we expected, except for the trends in Asia that we discussed. Accordingly, we are making a small adjustment to our outlook for total\npayments volume growth to the high-single-digits from the low-double-digits. Total cross-border volume, excluding Intra-Europe is expected to continue to grow\nstrongly in the mid-teens with the strength in e-commerce generally offsetting weakness in Asia travel. Remember that our drivers assume no recession or no\nfurther increase in Reg II impacts. Currency volatility remains low and we are assuming volatility in the third quarter continues at a similar rate to the second\nquarter and adjusts up slightly in the fourth quarter. Now on to the third quarter expectations. We expect adjusted net revenue growth in the low-double-digits,\ngenerally in line to the adjusted second quarter growth rate. Adjusted operating expenses in the third quarter are expected to grow in the low-teens, driven\nprimarily by Olympic-related marketing expense due to the strong client engagement that Ryan referenced. Non-operating income is expected to be between $50\nmillion and $60 million and the tax rate is expected to be between 19% and 19.5% in Q3 with the full year unchanged. This puts third-quarter adjusted EPS\ngrowth in the high end of low-double-digits. For the third quarter, Pismo is expected to have minimal benefit to net revenue growth and an approximately one point\nheadwind to non-GAAP operating expense and an approximately half point drag to non-GAAP EPS growth. FX for the third quarter is expected to have an\napproximately one point drag to net revenue growth and approximately one and a half point benefit to non-GAAP operating expense growth and an approximately\nhalf point drag to non-GAAP EPS growth. In summary, we had another solid quarter in Q2 with relatively stable underlying drivers and strong financial results. We\nfeel good about the momentum in our business as we head into the second half across consumer payments, new flows and value-added services. We remain\nthoughtful with our spending plans as we continue to balance between short and long-term considerations in the context of a changing environment.

Thank you for taking the question. There were some helpful comments around the e-commerce strength within cross-border offsetting some of the travel\nweakness. When we think about the components of overall cross-border, clearly, there's the traditional travel, so card present and card not present.

Okay. Let me start first with incentives, the first part of your question. So, as you all have seen from quarter-to-quarter, incentive growth can vary based on\na number of factors, client performance, deal timing, which is what caused half one to come in lower than anticipated. For our outlook for the second half of the\nyear, our expectations remain largely unchanged. We still expect year-over-year growth to be lower in the second half than in the first half as we lap the higher\nincentives that we saw starting in the second half of last year. And we do expect the Q4 incentive growth rate will be the lowest growth quarter of the year. So\nexpectations for half two are unchanged. To your second question on ATS, let me -- there's a lot of moving parts in here. And so maybe I'm just going to kind of\ngo through it in detail and unpack bit by bit. Globally, Q2 ATS year-over-year growth was down slightly, which is consistent with the growth that we saw in Q1.\nBreaking that apart between the US and international. In the US, ticket size growth actually continued to improve from Q1 to Q2, still slightly negative, but the\ntrend improved from Q1 to Q2. And looking ahead in the US, this is something that we've spoken to previously, we do continue to expect ATS will turn positive in\nthe second half of this year as we lap the lower ticket sizes in the second half of last year. Internationally, outside of Asia-Pacific, let's set that aside for a second,\nwe saw improvement in several regions, including the impact from higher inflation in several markets. And so overall, excluding Asia, we still expect ATS to turn\npositive in the second half based on the expected improvements in the US with the impact of Asia factored in, global ATS will be slightly negative and that was\nfactored into the revised payment volume outlook that I gave for the full year.", "char_count": 1868, "word_count": 334, "token_count": 407, "exchange_id": "ex_003", "exchange_role": "answer", "chunk_id": "V_TRANSCRIPT_2024_Q2_u_0016", "company": "V", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2024, "period": "2024-Q2", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/V/V_FY2024_Q2.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

I think there's been a lot of great work that's been done to bring this to a resolution. Just to remind everyone what the main planks of the resolution are. It\nreally is two different sets of things. One is it will reduce interchange for US -- for credit cards in the US market for both Visa and Mastercard and it will have no\nincreases in interchange for the five years of the agreement.

And finally as you kind of think about pricing for these services, to what extent it's a bundle pricing along with\n\ncore versus kind of a separately priced service? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney\nOkay. You have a great memory. As we've said, our top 265 clients or so use on average about 22 of our value-added services. We don't talk about like how\nthat's moved quarter-to-quarter, but the opportunity is enormous just when you think about the number of clients we have around the planet. And so as I was\nmentioning earlier kind of what we've done is we've armed our frontline teams with kind of client-by-client, what are they using, what are they not using, what are\nthe opportunities to create value for the client by putting value-added services A, B, C or D to work for them and we're having great success and you see that in\nthe numbers. In terms of the pricing, it's -- it's different pricing models for different products and different suites of solutions in different places around the world.\nWe're always trying to come up with the right product pricing mix that's going to work best for our products in the market.

Now Prosa itself is a great asset. It's been operating for 50 years in Mexico has deep processing experience, it has scale. They do more\nthan 10 billion transactions annually. They have a great base of clients.

Let me unpack that a little bit. From a -- as you heard us, we reaffirmed our prior year guide for the full year, adjusted net revenue growth, OpEx, EPS. And\nwithin that, I spoke about the fact that volatility is going to cause our currency volatility -- treasury revenues in international to be lower than we anticipated in Q3.\nBut again full year unchanged within that. Our expectations for new flows in that are consistent with the ones that we shared at the beginning of the year, which\nwe anticipated. For the full year, new flows will grow faster than consumer payments with weighted toward faster growth in the second half of the year. We're\nseeing that with the 14% growth in Q2. We anticipate continuing to see a good growth in the second half of the year. Value-added services has grown over 20%\nin each of the first two quarters. The momentum there is pretty evident. The second part of your question was, I think, around cross-border travel of volumes in\ntotal. So we did make a little bit of adjustment. You heard me talk about based on half-one trends. And so again, this is one with a couple of parts, so let's just go\nthrough it in detail. First of all, we feel really good, feel great about our first-half total cross-border performance, 16% growth in Q2, in line with our expectations,\nand within that, travel was 17% and e-commerce growth mid-teens better than expected. And so that unpacking travel a bit, we've seen most of our travel volume\nexpectations play out actually as we planned at the beginning of the year, which continues to be strong and healthy in most regions LAC, Europe, CEMEA and all\nthe ones that I talked about on the call, with Asia being the exception to that, which again continues to improve with the pace of recovery being slower than\nexpected, offset again by strength in the e-commerce cross-border business, which is performing better than we expected.So we expect these trends to continue\ninto the second half and thus, we've moderated our outlook for travel due to AP and upped our expectations on e-commerce.
