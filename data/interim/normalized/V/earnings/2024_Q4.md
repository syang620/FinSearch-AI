## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Harshita Rawat (Bernstein)**: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. A lot going on in the U.S. regulatory front with regards to the DoJ lawsuit, Reg II, MDL, CCA. Can you share
your overall thoughts on the regulatory and litigation environment in the U.S.? And Chris, just as a follow-up, can you help us maybe size your revenue exposure
to U.S. debit, both including as well as excluding Visa DPS? Thank you.

Ryan McInerney
Yeah, thanks for the question. As you note, a lot going on not just in the U.S. but all over the world. I think regulators appropriately are looking at the payments
ecosystem and want to ensure that there's fair competition, that there's multiple options, both for consumers and merchants. And that's a process of engagement
that we have in the U.S. to your question, but also with regulators, elected officials all around the world. And we feel very good about our ability to manage
through that complexity. We feel very good about the ability to continue to run and grow our business. And we feel very good about the ability to continue to
innovate and to continue to serve our clients. In terms of revenue exposure, that's not something that we disclose as it relates to U.S. debit or other parts of the
business like that. But in terms of our ability to compete, we feel really, really good about it.

**Chris Suh (CFO)**: Hi, Sanjay, this is Chris. Yeah, as you noted, we did see a days mix impact in Q4 with commercial volumes. But if I just back way up, we're excited about the
opportunity in new flows. We're optimistic about the big opportunity ahead. And over time, we do anticipate that we'll see continued growth of commercial volumes
ahead of consumer volumes over time.

### Exchange 002

**Rayna Kumar (Oppenheimer)**: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Last week, the CFPB issued a final open banking rule for the U.S. Can you talk about what opportunities this
could present for Visa from Tink's perspective and what potential headwinds that could create? Thank you.
Ryan McInerney
My understanding is that the new rules that they, I guess, finalized are largely consistent with the CFPB's initial proposal. And we are strong advocates for
consumers having more control and more access to the financial data but ensuring that it's in a safe and secure way. We're still evaluating all the details of the
potential impacts from the more detailed regulations across the industry. But it goes without saying, our own capabilities will comply with the CFPB's rules as well
as our clients' very high bar for security and privacy. Widening the aperture a little bit to the opportunities that it creates, I think in an environment that open
banking is even more available in the United States, like it is in places like Europe, what we found is that the Visa brand can be a meaningful differentiator. The
Visa brand can give confidence to end users and data providers, and that if we can bring our capabilities to market like we've done in Europe with Visa A2A, we
can give more confidence to the whole ecosystem and help resolve a lot of the complexities that exist in open banking. So we remain excited about the
opportunities to add value, especially in the U.S., where we're still in the pretty nascent stages of all this.

**Chris Suh (CFO)**: Yeah, sure. So a couple of things. So as you pointed out, international revenue grew slower than total cross-border volumes. It really did have to do with the
volatility. So Q4 volatility did improve from Q3 a bit but it was lower than the volatility that we saw last year. And secondly, the associated volume, the
cross-border volume, 13% in Q4, as expected, but also lower than the volume growth that we saw in Q4 a year ago. And so when you combine those things that
had impacted the differential that you see between volumes and revenue.

### Exchange 003

**Tim Chiodo (UBS)**: Great. Thank you for taking the question. So I wanted to dig into two specific aspects of value-added services, so first being DPS and the second being
CyberSource. I believe those two combined make up a reasonably large portion of the transaction-based value-added services. I think the last disclosure on DPS
was about $2.5 trillion in volume, and CyberSource is in the roughly $1 trillion. I was hoping you could give sort of relative growth rates relative to the rest of
value-added services and maybe some updated stats if possible. Thanks.
Ryan McInerney
Yeah, thanks for the question. We're super proud about the progress that we're making in DPS and CyberSource, DPS being primarily in the U.S. and
CyberSource being a really at-scale global platform now. But we don't provide transaction volume growth or break out other metrics at that level of reporting. So I
appreciate the interest. Sorry not to be able to provide any more detail.

### Exchange 004

**Bryan Keane (Deutsche Bank)**: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask about the pickup you've seen in October for volume growth, especially in debit. Looks like it's perked up a little bit to
7%. Anything you're seeing there in new wins or is that potentially a better economic environment driving that? And then just quickly, secondly, on the price to
value, just the change in timing, what was the reason for the change? Why is the timing different this year?

**Chris Suh (CFO)**: Sure. Okay, I'll start with your question about October and then I think Ryan will handle your second part of your question. So in terms of October, so as we've
consistently said, three weeks don't make a trend. It was true in July when we started a little bit slower and then Q4 ended up being stable. And we think it's true
now as we see a strong start to October. Now that said, here's a couple of things that we see in terms of relative strength between the month of October and how
we ended Q4. Two things that I'd point to: one is days mix. So the growth in the month of September was lower due to days mix. Last year, September had an
extra Friday and Saturday, which are two of the highest spend days of the week. And this September, that was replaced with a Sunday and Monday, which are
two of the lower spend days. And so that had an impact on September growth. And then secondly, in the U.S., in addition to that days mix point, we are starting to
lap the modest impact of Reg II that we started to talk about a year ago in Q1. And so those combined things are contributing to what we see as the start of
October. But as we said, it's three weeks. Let's see how the quarter plays out.
Ryan McInerney
Bryan, yeah, as you noted and we've said many times, we price to value. So when we price to value, we have to ship products. We have to ship services. We
have to deliver solutions that are adding value and increasing value to our clients. And our product pipeline in 2025 is a bit more backloaded, especially as we
bring some new and exciting products and services to the market, and so that really drives the difference in pricing cadence in 2025.

### Exchange 005

**Jason Kupferberg (Bank of America)**: Thanks, guys. Just looking at the U.S. card-present volume growth, I think we've been in the 2% range here for the past two or three quarters. So wondering if
you're expecting that to accelerate in fiscal '25. And Chris, can you just quantify what that favorable adjustment to Q4 new flows revenues were? Thank you.

**Chris Suh (CFO)**: Got it. Jason, you cut out a little bit at the end. What was the second part of your question, Jason?

### Exchange 006

**Jason Kupferberg (Bank of America)**: That onetime helper to new flows revenue in Q4, if you could quantify that?

**Chris Suh (CFO)**: Okay, got it. I'll start with the second one since you just asked it. Yeah, we feel great about the momentum of new flows. Q3 was 18%, now to 22% in Q4. As I
said on the call though, Q4 was helped by this onetime rebate adjustment due to deal timing. So we had expected a client to earn a rebate, which was contingent
on them achieving a milestone, and they didn't achieve it. So as such, we recorded a onetime adjustment to that rebate, which landed in Q4. And I think your first
question was around card-present and just sort of volumes as we look forward into FY '25. And maybe that's why I'll go out, just broaden it a little bit and say, per
our call, our overall assumptions on underlying drivers is that in '25, they remain relatively stable to the trends that we see, both for the full year on payment
volume and payment transactions relative to '24 and then on cross-border to the trends that we see in Q4. And so they will remain relatively strong and healthy.
And like I said, we'll continue to update you throughout the course of the year.

### Exchange 007

**Trevor Williams (Jefferies)**: Great, thanks a lot. Yeah, I wanted to follow up on value-added services. I think the general framework you've given is roughly two thirds of VAS revenue is
transaction-linked in some form. Of that portion that's tied to transactions or volume, how much of that today needs to be running over VisaNet for you to be
earning those vast revenue streams? Ryan, it sounds like most of it today is still running over your network but maybe the off-network piece should be increasing
as a percentage of the mix over time. But anything more specific there would be helpful. Thanks.
Ryan McInerney
Yeah. I mean, the largest component of our VAS revenue today is that first bucket of services I mentioned for Visa transactions, and obviously, we've been doing
that the longest time. And just to comment on that, what that really does is it drives additional yield on top of our Visa transactions. So we're adding more value to
the transaction. We're adding more value to the clients and ultimately driving additional yield on top of the Visa payments volume growth that we see. But as I
said, we also see -- we've made meaningful progress building out our platforms to service non-Visa transactions. CyberSource I mentioned, Verifi I mentioned,
Pismo I mentioned, Decision Manager I mentioned. These are all becoming meaningful platforms for us with meaningful opportunity. And you can just imagine the
TAM that we're able to go after when we're not just delivering services for Visa transactions but we're able to work with clients to deliver services on top of a much
broader array of payment transactions is just significant. So we remain very excited about both.
