## Prepared Remarks

### Jeremy Barnum (Unknown)

Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $14 billion, EPS of $4.81 on revenue of $43.7 billion with an ROTCE 
of 21%. On Page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results. The firm reported revenue of $43.7 billion, up $3.8 billion or 10% year-on-year. NII ex-markets 
was down $548 million or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and the associated deposit margin compression as well as lower deposit balances in CCB, 
largely offset by the impact of securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in card and higher wholesale deposit balances. NII ex-markets was up $3.1 
billion or 30%. Excluding the prior year's net investment securities losses, it was up 21%, largely on higher asset management fees and investment banking fees. 
And markets revenue was up $1.2 billion or 21%. Expenses of $22.8 billion were down $1.7 billion or 7% year-on-year. Excluding the prior year's FDIC special 
assessment, expenses were up $1.2 billion or 5%, predominantly driven by compensation as well as higher brokerage and distribution fees. And credit costs were 
$2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.4 billion and a net reserve of $267 million. On Page 3, you can see the reported results for the full year, I'll remind you 
that there were a number of significant items in 2024. Excluding those items, the firm reported net income of $54 billion, EPS of $18.22, revenue of $173 billion 
and we delivered an ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights for the year, in CCB, we had a record number of first-time investors and acquired nearly 
10 million new card accounts. In CIB, we had record revenue in markets, payments, and security services, and in AWM, we had record long-term net inflows of 
$234 billion, positive across all channels, regions, and asset classes. On to balance sheet and capital on Page 4, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 
15.7%, up 40 basis points versus the prior quarter as net income and lower RWA were largely offset by both OCI losses and capital distributions, which included 
$4 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter. The $24 billion decrease in RWA reflects a seasonal decline in markets activity and lower wholesale 
lending, which was predominantly offset by a seasonal increase in card. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 5. CCB reported net income 
of $4.5 billion on revenue of $18.4 billion, which was up 1% year-on-year. In Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was down 7% year-on-year on deposit 
margin compression and lower deposits, partially offset by growth in wealth management revenue. Average deposits were down 4% year-on-year and flat 
sequentially as consumer balances have stabilized. Client investment assets were up 14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we 
continue to see healthy flows across branch and digital channels. In Home Lending, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher 
production revenue. Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances. Card 
outstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and revolver growth. And in Auto, originations were $10.6 billion, up 7%, reflecting higher lease 
volume on robust new vehicle inventory. Expenses of $9.7 billion were up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by field compensation and growth in 
technology. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion, up $428 million year-on-year, driven 
by Card. The net reserve build was $557 million, predominantly driven by higher Card revolving balances. Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on Page 6. 
CIB reported net income of $6.6 billion on revenue of $17.6 billion. IV fees were up 49% year-on-year and we ranked number one with wallet share of 9.3% for 
2024. Advisory fees were up 41%, benefiting from large deals and share growth in a number of key sectors. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 
56% and equity up 54%, primarily driven by favorable market conditions. In terms of the outlook for the overall investment banking wallet, in light of the positive 
momentum, we remain optimistic about our pipeline. Payments revenue was $4.7 billion, up 3% year-on-year, excluding equity investments, driven by higher 
deposit balances and fee growth, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was $1.9 billion, up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven by 
lower losses on hedges. Moving to markets, total revenue was $7 billion, up 21% year-on-year. Fixed income was up 20% with better performance in credit as 
well as continued outperformance in currencies and emerging markets. Equities was up 22% on elevated client activity and derivatives amid increased volatility 
and higher trading volumes and cash. Security Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 10% year-on-year, driven by fee growth on higher client activity and market 
levels as well as higher deposit balances. Expenses of $8.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher brokerage, technology, and legal 
expense. Average banking and payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially. Global Corporate & Investment Banking loans were 
down 2% quarter-on-quarter, driven by paydowns in lower short-term financing, primarily offset by new originations. In commercial banking, middle market loans 
were also down 2%, driven by paydowns, predominantly offset by new originations, and commercial real estate loans were flat as new originations were offset by 
paydowns. Average client deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 5% sequentially, driven by underlying client growth. Finally, credit costs were $61 million, driven 
by net downgrade activity and the net impact of charge-offs, offset -- largely offset by a reserve release due to an update to certain loss assumptions. Then to 
complete our lines of business, Asset & Wealth Management on Page 7. AWM reported net income of $1.5 billion with pre-tax margin of 35%. Revenue of $5.8 
billion was up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows as well as higher 
performance fees. Expenses of $3.8 billion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation 
and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $76 billion for the quarter, positive 
across all asset classes. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $94 billion for the quarter and $104 billion for the full year -- $140 billion for the full year, sorry. And we 
had client asset net inflows of $468 billion for the year. AUM of $4 trillion and client assets of $5.9 trillion were both up 18% year-on-year, driven by continued net 
inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were up 5% quarter-on-quarter. Turning to Corporate on Page 8; 
Corporate reported net income of $1.3 billion. Revenue of $2 billion was up $223 million year-on-year. NII of $2 billion was down $415 million year-on-year, driven 
by the impact of lower rates, largely offset by balance sheet actions, primarily securities reinvestment activity. NII was a net loss of $30 million compared to the 
net loss of $668 million in the prior year, driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter. And expenses of $550 million were down $3 billion 
year-on-year, predominantly driven by the absence of the FDIC Special Assessment of $2.9 billion in the prior year. With that, let's pivot to the outlook, starting 
with NII on Page 9. We expect 2025 NII ex-markets to be approximately $90 billion. Going through the drivers, as usual, the outlook assumes that rates follow the 
forward curve. It's worth noting that the NII decrease is driven by both the cut expected in 2025 and the impact of the 100 basis points of cuts in the back half of 
2024. You can see on the page that we've illustrated the historical trajectory of card loan growth. We expect healthy card loan growth again this year, but below 
the 12% pace we saw in 2024 as tailwinds from revolve normalization are largely behind us. Turning to deposits; firm-wide deposits have stabilized and we 
expect to see a more visible growth trend to assert itself in the second half of 2025. It's notable that we can already see that trend in consumer checking deposits. 
On deposit margin, we expect modest compression due to lower rates. When you put all that together, we expect the NII trough could be sometime in the middle

of the year, followed by growth as we illustrated at the bottom of the bar. And for completeness, we expect firm-wide NII to be approximately $94 billion as a
function of markets NII increasing to about $4 billion, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR. Finally, I want to point out that starting this quarter,
we are including an estimate of earnings at risk in the earnings supplement, so you no longer have to wait for the K or the Q to get that number. Now let's turn to
expenses on Page 10. We expect 2025 expense to be about $95 billion. Looking at the chart in the middle of the page, I'll touch on the drivers of the year-on-year
change, which you'll note are very consistent with what you've been hearing from us recently. The largest increase is volume and revenue-related expense, which
is primarily driven by expected growth in auto leasing as well as capital markets. As a reminder, this comes with higher revenues. We continue to hire bankers
and advisors to support business growth as well as expand our branch network. The increase in tech spend is primarily business-driven as we continue to invest
in new products, features, and customer platforms as well as modernization. Marketing remains a driver of spend as we continue to see attractive opportunities,
resulting in strong demand and engagement in our Card business. And finally, while we haven't explicitly called it out in each bar, inflation remains a source of
some upward pressure, and as always, we are generating efficiencies to help offset it. Now let's turn to Page 11 to cover credit and wrap-up. On credit, we expect
the 2025 card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 3.6%. So, in closing, 2024 was another year of record revenue and net
income, and we're proud of what we accomplished. As we look ahead to 2025, we still expect NII normalization, although to a lesser extent than we previously
thought. And taking a step back, we think it's important to acknowledge the tension in the risks and uncertainties in the environment and the degree of optimism
embedded in asset prices and expectations. In that context, we remain upbeat about the strength of the franchise, but we are focused on being prepared for a
wide range of scenarios. Finally, let me say a few words about the wildfires in Los Angeles, while we don't expect much of a financial impact from it, we have a
presence in the area across all three lines of business, so we're keeping in close contact with our customers, clients, and employees. We are offering support in a
variety of ways, including waiving consumer and business banking fees as well as making a contribution to local relief organizations, offering employee donation
matching, and supporting employee volunteer efforts. With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie before we open up the line for Q&A.

## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Mike Mayo (Wells Fargo)**: Hi. Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who is your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at Investor Day, how --
why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I'm hearing from investors now, this goes up and down, but I think investors would like you to stay. So why
say you're going to stay less than five years and you're finally getting what you wanted, 15 years of your spaghetti chart about the regulatory structure and the
unpredictability of capital requirements and the regulatory costs and it seems like you're finally getting what you've been playing for, so why not stay around a bit
longer if investors want you to do so? And what would you do otherwise anyway, you don't play golf, you aren't going to be Treasury Secretary. It seems like your
work is your hobby, right? So how much longer would you stay around?

### Exchange 002

**Mike Mayo (Wells Fargo)**: Who is you're successor?

### Exchange 003

**Mike Mayo (Wells Fargo)**: So, you will stay around maybe for a few more years base case right now?

### Exchange 004

**Mike Mayo (Wells Fargo)**: All right. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. You may proceed.

### Exchange 005

**Erika Najarian (UBS)**: Yes, hi, good morning. I wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of Jeremy, the cross currents in terms of the denominator. So
if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put you in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So
obviously, from what we understand, if you print that somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then your G-SIB surcharge goes up by -- to 5% or by 50
basis points two years and one day from now. At the same time, around the holidays, we did get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit
from the banks. In terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test.
So as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So as we think about your returns going forward,
the definition of excess also continues to shift. So how should we think about those cross currents in terms of two big components, clearly one is your G-SIB
surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer?

### Exchange 006

**Erika Najarian (UBS)**: And just a follow-up question. Follow-up to John's line of questioning, as a placeholder, as we think about what you said, trying to arrest the growth of CET1, for
now, should we just assume that anything that you don't need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of that 15.7% we bought back by the
company as we think about? I know you don't want to predict the buyback, but is that sort of just a placeholder for now as we think about what can return back to
shareholders in the form of repurchase?

### Exchange 007

**Betsy Graseck (Morgan Stanley)**: Hi, good morning.

### Exchange 008

**Betsy Graseck (Morgan Stanley)**: Hi, can you hear me, okay. All right. Just want to make sure you can hear me. So this has been a great call. First, congratulations on a great quarter. It's been a
great call with a lot of robust questions here. You're like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question. As we think about the NII outlook and you highlighted the
NIM pressure, but loans, but basically balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to the -- could you help me understand the order of the
drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth inflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth
opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think about your comments around, you've got the green market-share, number one, you've got
the yellow, you've got the red places maybe we can't see. Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are, where they are? Are they just
scattered, everybody is -- every single business has one or are there some that have more than others and therefore, more opportunities and is it more balance
sheet or fee generative? That's kind of what I'd like to just discuss if you have a minute. Thanks.

### Exchange 009

**Betsy Graseck (Morgan Stanley)**: Thank you.

### Exchange 010

**Ebrahim Poonawala (Bank of America)**: Hi, good morning. I guess just two questions. In terms of areas of vulnerability, so I heard you, Jeremy, on the lending side, but lots of cross currents, like if we
anchor to the fact that you have an administration that's taking play and you'll take office with a focus on domestic CapEx. Even if we don't get any rate cuts,
when you look through your customer base, where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of tariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from
the Fed? Yes, I would love to hear just from a credit quality perspective, what no rate cuts might mean.

### Exchange 011

**Ebrahim Poonawala (Bank of America)**: Okay. And I guess, thanks for that. Just sticking with that, as far as QT is concerned, when you talk to experts, like no one knows where the right level for the Fed
to end is. I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts there on how -- when the Fed should end the pressure on the system and what it may imply for deposit
growth?

### Exchange 012

**Ebrahim Poonawala (Bank of America)**: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question is comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.

### Exchange 013

**Gerard Cassidy (RBC)**: Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jamie. Jeremy, you mentioned...

### Exchange 014

**Gerard Cassidy (RBC)**: You mentioned in your comments about the overall firm-wide deposits have stabilized and in the second half, you could see some growth in your various -- I think
you said you started to see maybe some of that in the consumer checking deposits, we noticed in the industry data from the regulators, household checking
deposits pre-pandemic for the industry were running about $1 trillion. Now they have remained elevated post-pandemic at $4 trillion. Can you -- based on what
you're seeing in your customer base, what can you attribute the strength to in this consumer checking account deposits?

### Exchange 015

**Gerard Cassidy (RBC)**: Very good. And then as a follow-up, circling back about the capital levels, you guys have been very clear about where you want them to be. Can you share with
us the pros and cons from JPMorgan's perspective, not so much from an investor, but we understand, of course, you can do a share repurchase. Obviously, you
can do non-depository acquisitions with the excess capital. But what are the pros and cons of a special dividend to reduce that excess capital? If you continue
with these incredible profitability levels of 20% return on tangible common equity, you're growing your income and capital very nicely every year. But what are
those pros and cons, again, from JPMorgan's perspective?

### Exchange 016

**Gerard Cassidy (RBC)**: Sounds good. Thank you, gentlemen.
