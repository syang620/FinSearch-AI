Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $14.6 billion, EPS of $5.07 on revenue of $46 billion with an ROTCE \nof 21%. These results included a First Republic related gain of $588 million, which was previously disclosed in the 10-K. On Page 2, we have more on our first \nquarter results. The firm reported revenue of $46 billion, up $3.5 billion or 8% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was down $430 million or 2%, driven by the impact of \nlower rates and deposit margin compression as well as lower deposit balances in CCB. This was predominantly offset by higher card revolving balances, the \nimpact of securities activity, including from prior quarters, as well as higher wholesale deposits. NIR ex. Markets was up $2.2 billion or 20%, and excluding the \nsignificant item I just mentioned was up 14%, largely on higher asset management fees, lower net investment securities losses and higher investment banking \nfees. And Markets revenue was up $1.7 billion or 21%. Expenses of $23.6 billion were up $840 million or 4%, largely driven by compensation, including growth in \nemployees across the front office and technology, higher brokerage and distribution fees, as well as marketing and legal expense. The quarter also reflected a \n$323 million release of the FDIC special assessment accrual compared with a $725 million increase in the prior quarter. Credit costs were $3.3 billion, with net \ncharge-offs of $2.3 billion and a net reserve build of $973 million We have more details on the reserve build on Page 3. With this quarter's reserve build, firm's \ntotal allowance for credit losses is $27.6 billion. Let's take a second to add a little bit of context to our thinking surrounding this number in light of the unique \nenvironment of the last several weeks. Our first quarter allowance is anchored on the relatively benign central case economic outlook, which was in effect at the \nend of the quarter. But in light of the significantly elevated risks and uncertainties at the time, we increased the probability weightings associated with the \ndownside scenarios in our CECL framework. As a result, the weighted average unemployment rate embedded in our allowance is 5.8%, up from 5.5% last \nquarter, driving the $973 million increase in the allowance. So, with that in mind, the consumer build of $441 million was driven by changes in the weighted \naverage macroeconomic outlook. The wholesale build of $549 million was predominantly driven by credit quality changes on certain exposures and net lending \nactivity as well as changes in the outlook. In addition, it's important to note that the increase in the allowance is not, to any meaningful degree, driven by \ndeterioration in the actual credit performance in the portfolio, which remains largely in line with expectations. With that, let's go to balance sheet and capital on \nPage 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.4%, down 30 basis points versus the prior quarter as net income and OCI gains were more than offset by \ncapital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter, the firm distributed $11 billion of capital to shareholders, which reflects $7.1 billion of net common share \nrepurchases and the payment of our common dividend, which has been increased to $1.40 per share. This quarter's higher RWA is primarily driven by overall \nbusiness growth in Markets and some seasonal effects. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 5. Consumers and small businesses remain \nfinancially healthy. Despite the recent downtrends in consumer and small business sentiment based on our data, spend, cash buffers, payment to income ratios \nand credit utilization are all in line with our expectations. Moving to the financial results, CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $18.3 billion, which \nwas up 4% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 1% year-on-year, driven by lower deposit NII, predominantly offset by growth in \nWealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially, while end-of-period deposits were up 2% quarter-on-quarter. \nClient investment assets were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance and we continue to see strong flows into managed products.

Card outstandings were up 10% due to strong account acquisition. And in Auto, originations were $10.7 billion, up 20%, driven by higher lease volume. \nExpenses of $9.9 billion were up 6% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in marketing and technology, higher field compensation, as well as higher auto \nlease depreciation. Credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion, up $275 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by the seasoning of \nrecent vintages in Card with delinquencies and losses in line with expectations. The net reserve build was $475 million, of which $400 million was in Card. Next, \nthe Commercial & Investment Bank on Page 6. CIB reported net income of $6.9 billion on revenue of $19.7 billion, which is up 12% year-on-year. IB fees were up \n12% year-on-year and we ranked #1 with wallet share of 9%. In advisory, fees were up 16%, benefiting from the closing of deals announced in 2024. Debt \nunderwriting fees were up 16%, primarily driven by elevated refinancing activity, particularly in leveraged finance. In equity underwriting, fees were down 9% \nyear-on-year, reflecting challenging market conditions. In light of market conditions, we are adopting a cautious stance on the investment banking outlook. While \nclient engagement and dialogue is quite elevated, both the conversion of the existing pipeline and origination of new activity will require a reduction in the current \nlevels of uncertainty. Payments revenue was up 3% year-on-year, excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, predominantly \noffset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was up 11% year-on-year, driven by lower losses on hedges, partially offset by lower balances. Moving to \nMarkets, total revenue was up 21% year-on-year, reflecting record performance in equities. Fixed Income was up 8% with better performance in rates and \ncommodities against a relatively weak prior-year quarter. Equities was up 48% as the business performed well during a period of elevated volatility supported by \nhigher client activity and strong monetization of flows, particularly in derivatives. Securities Services revenue was up 7% year-on-year, driven by fee growth and \nhigher deposit balances, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $9.8 billion were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher \ncompensation, legal and brokerage expense. Average Banking & Payments loans were down 3% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially as we continue to \nobserve payoff activity and limited demand for new loans across client segments. Average client deposits were up 11% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially, \nreflecting increased activity across Payments and Securities Services. Finally, credit costs were $705 million, largely driven by the net reserve build. Then, to \ncomplete our lines of business, Asset & Wealth Management on Page 7. AWM reported net income of $1.6 billion, with pre-tax margin of 35%. Revenue of $5.7 \nbillion was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, as well as higher \nbrokerage activity and higher deposit balances. Expenses of $3.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including \nrevenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $54 \nbillion for the quarter, primarily driven by equity and fixed income. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $36 billion. AUM of $4.1 trillion and client assets of $6 trillion \nwere both up 15% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 5% year-on-year and flat quarter-on-quarter, \nand deposits were up 7% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially. Turning to Corporate on Page 8. Corporate reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of \n$2.3 billion was up $102 million year-on-year. NII of $1.7 billion was down $826 million year-on-year. NIR was a net gain of $653 million compared with a net loss\n\nof $275 million in the prior year. Current quarter included the significant item I mentioned upfront, while the prior-year quarter included net securities losses of\n$336 million. Expenses of $185 million were down $1.1 billion year-on-year, driven by the changes to the FDIC special assessment accruals I mentioned upfront.\nTo finish up, let's turn to the full year outlook on Page 9. We continue to expect NII ex. Markets to be approximately $90 billion. The firm-wide NII outlook has\nincreased to about $94.5 billion, reflecting an increase in Markets NII, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR. Our adjusted expense outlook\ncontinues to be about $95 billion. And on Credit, we expect the card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 3.6%. So, to\nwrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance, but of course, the focus right now is on the future, which is obviously unusually\nuncertain. But no matter what outcomes eventually materialize, we are eager to do our part to continue to support our clients, the markets and the broader\neconomy, and we believe the banking system will be a source of strength in this dynamic environment. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.\nOperator\nThank you. Please standby. Our first question comes from Ken Usdin with Autonomous.

So, I mean, at a high level, I would say that, obviously, some of the salient news flow is quite recent. So, we've done some soundings and some\nchecking both on the consumer side and on the wholesale side. I think on the consumer side, the thing to check is the spending data. And to be honest, the main\nthing that we see there is what would appear to be a certain amount of front-loading of spending ahead of people expecting price increases from tariffs. So,\nironically, that's actually somewhat supportive all else equal. But I think what it sort of highlights is that during this transitional period and this elevated uncertainty,\nyou might see some distortions in the data that make it hard to draw larger conclusions. In terms of our corporate clients, obviously, they've been reacting to the\nchanges in tariff policy. And at the margin that shifts their focus away from more strategic priorities with obvious implications for the Investment Banking pipeline\noutlook towards more short-term work, optimizing supply chains and trying to figure out how they're going to respond to the current environment. So, as a result, I\nthink we would characterize what we're hearing from our corporate clients is a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude. I do think you see obvious differences across\nsectors. Some sectors are going to be much more exposed than others and have more complicated problems to solve, and also across the size of the clients, I\nthink, smaller clients, small business and smaller corporates are probably a little bit more challenged. I think the larger corporates have a bit more experience\ndealing with these things and more resources to manage. So, that's a little bit of our read of the situation right now, but certainly a bit of a wait-and-see attitude.\nIt's hard to make long-term decisions right now.

So, sentiment -- but banks are a cork in the ocean when it comes to the economy. If the economy gets worse, credit\nloss will go up, volumes can change, yield curve can change, and we're not predicting all of that. What I would say is our excellent economist, Michael Feroli, I\ncalled him this morning, specifically to ask him with -- how they're looking at their forecast today. They think it's about 50-50 for recession, so I'll just refer to that.\nObviously, if there's a recession, credit loss will go up, and other factors will change, too. And I think the one thing I'll add to what Jeremy said is, and I don't\nusually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am, and I think you're going to see a lot of companies, you guys -- not you, but the analyst community\nhas already reduced its earnings estimates for the S&P by 5%. So, it's now up 5% as opposed to up 10%. My guess is that'll be 0% and negative 5% probably the\nnext month. And then, you're going to hear a thousand companies report and they're going to tell you what their guidance is. My guess is, a lot will remove it.\nThey're going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers, their base, their earnings, their cost, their tariffs. It's different for every company, but I\nassume you see that. And anecdotally, a lot of people are not doing things because of this. They're going to wait and see. And that's M&A, M&A with middle\nmarket companies, that's people's hiring plans and stuff like that. So, people have to adjust this new environment. And I think you will see what it is. I just also\nwant to point out just so you can round it up, this is to make you feel comfortable, not uncomfortable. When COVID hit, unemployment went from like 4% to 15%\nin a couple of months, and we had to add to reserves in a two-month period $15 billion.

We're seeing that, too. So, let me talk about travel. I mean, we obviously saw the airlines discuss what they are seeing as headwinds\nfor them specifically in airline travel and we're seeing that too through the card spend. It's not obvious to us that that's necessarily an indicator for broader\npatterns. There are a variety of potential explanations for the narrow drop in airline spend. And as I mentioned previously, another thing that we are seeing\nlooking at the April data is what would appear to be a little bit of front-loading of spending, specifically in items that might be -- have prices go up as a function of\ntariffs. So, you see people behaving rationally and I have noted even you hear anecdotes and I've seen evidence of companies specifically advertising. We have\npre-tariff inventory and so on and so forth. So, it's not that surprising that you're seeing that a little bit in the spending data. The other thing that people are kind of\ninterested in the space is like what's happening by income then, because we have seen some of the retailers and other folks talking about weaknesses in the\nlower-income segment. And I think when we look at our card data and also our cash buffers and people's checking accounts, of course, it is true that it is\nrelatively weaker in the lower-income segment. But when you take a step back and you ask, are we seeing signs of distress in the lower-income segment? The\nanswer is no. So, sure, the margin cash buffers are lower and you see some rotation of spend and spending is a little bit weaker than it was in the peak spending\nmoments, but actually, some of the increases in spending that we're seeing in April are actually coming from the lower-income segment. So, no evidence of\ndistress, I would say.\nMatt O'Connor\nOkay. That's helpful color.

So, you've slightly answered your own question there, Saul, but it is nonetheless a good question. So, let me unpack it a little bit. So, the way I think about\nit is, there are some elements of the expense base, which automatically reset as a function of the business environment. So, we talk about those as volume and\nrevenue related expense. And so, you will see those come down as a function of the environment. It's also true that there are conceivably certain investment\nbusiness cases, which depending on how the environment changes, could no longer make sense analyzed in the same way that we analyzed them originally, i.e.,\nthrough the lens of their ability to generate long-term shareholder value through a long investment cycle. And so, if, for whatever reason, the environment\nchanges in such a way as to make certain of those investments less compelling, we would obviously adjust. Of course, the thing that we're not going to do is stop\ninvesting in things that we still think are very compelling through our traditional long-term investment lens simply for the purposes of achieving a cosmetic\nreduction in expenses in an environment where you may or may not have a reduction in revenues for unrelated reasons. As you well know, that's just not how we\nrun the company. This quarter, as it happens, a question you might have is, how are you managing to keep your guidance the same with what you're saying\nabout, for example, the Investment Banking outlook. But it's worth noting that Investment Banking performance this quarter was actually fine. As you know,\nmarkets performance was very strong. And there are also some ups and downs in there, I should note, including the fact that there is some sensitivity to the\nexpense base to the strength of the dollar or weakness in this case.
