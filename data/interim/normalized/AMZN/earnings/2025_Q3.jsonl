We saw strong growth across our business in Q3, and we're reporting $180.2 billion in revenue, up 12% year-over-year, excluding the impact from \nforeign exchange rates. Operating income was $17.4 billion, but would have been over $21 billion, if not for 2 special Q3 expenses, $2.5 billion for an FTC \nsettlement and $1.8 billion for estimated severance costs. Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $14.8 billion. I'll start with AWS. AWS is growing at a pace we \nhaven't seen since 2022, reaccelerating to 20.2% year-over-year, our largest growth rate in 11 quarters. It's worth remembering that year-over-year percentage \ngrowth is a relative term. It's very different having 20% year-over-year growth on a $132 billion annualized run rate and to have a higher percentage growth rate \non a meaningfully smaller annual revenue, which is the case with our competitors. Backlog grew to $200 billion by Q3 quarter end and doesn't include several \nunannounced new deals in October, which together or more than our total deal volume for all of Q3. AWS is gaining momentum. Customers want to be running \ntheir core and AI workloads in AWS given its stronger functionality, security and operational performance and the scale I see in front of us gives me significant \nconfidence in what lies ahead. I'll share a little more detail on why. It starts with AWS having much broader infrastructure functionality. Start-ups, enterprises and \ngovernments want to move their production workloads to the place that has the broadest and deepest array of capabilities. AWS has more services and deeper \nfeatures within those services than anybody else and continues to innovate at a rapid clip. These are key building blocks for anything that customers want to \ncreate, and they're a big part of why Gartner has named AWS leader in its strategic cloud platform services Magic Quadrant for 15 consecutive years. We're \nbringing the same building block approach to AI. SageMaker makes it much simpler for companies to build and deploy their own foundation models. Bedrock \ngives customers leading selection of foundation models and superior price performance to deploy inference into their next-generation applications. A lot of the \nfuture value companies will get from AI will be in the form of agents. AWS is heavily investing in this area and well positioned to be a leader. Companies will both \ncreate their own agents and use agents from other companies. For those building their own, it's been harder to build than it should be. It's why we launched \nstrands to make it much easier to create agents from any foundation model that builders desire. For companies who successfully built agents, they've hesitated \nputting them into production because they lack secure scalable runtime services or memory or observability built specifically for agents. It's why we launched \nAgentCore, a set of infrastructure building blocks that allow builders to deploy secure, scalable agents. Ericsson used AgentCore to deliver AI agents across their \nworkforce, Sony used it to build a agentic AI platform with enterprise-level security, observability and scalability. And Cohere Health is using AgentCore to deploy \nagents that will reduce medical review times by up to 30% to 40%. AgentCore's SDK has already been downloaded over 1 million times, and our builders are \nexcited about it. It's an enabler. Companies will also use other agents, and AWS continues to build many of the agents we believe builders will use in the future. \nFor coding, we've recently opened up our agentic coding IDE called Kiro. More than 100,000 developers jumped into Kiro in just the first few days of preview and \nthat number has more than doubled since. It's processed trillions of tokens thus far, weekly actives are growing fast, and developers love its unique spec and tool \ncall and capabilities. For migration and transformation, we offer an agent called Transform. Year-to-date, customers have already used it to save 700,000 hours of \nmanual effort. The equivalent of 335 developer years of work. For example, Thomson Reuters used it to transform 1.5 million lines of code per month, moving \nfrom Windows to open source alternatives and completing tasks or a times faster than with other migration tools. Customers have also already used Transform to \nanalyze nearly 1 billion lines of mainframe code as they move mainframe applications to the cloud. For business customers, we've recently launched QuickSleep \nto bring a consumer AI-like experience to work, making it easy to find insights, conduct deep research, automate tasks, visualize data and take actions. We've \nalready seen users churn months long projects in today's get 80% plus time savings on complex tasks and realize 90% plus cost savings. And for contact \ncenters, we offer Amazon Connect which creates a more personalized and efficient experience for contact center agents, managers and their customers. Connect \nhas recently crested $1 billion annualized revenue run rate with 12 billion minutes of customer interactions being handled by AI in the last year and is being used \nby large enterprises like Capital One, Toyota, American Airlines and Ryanair. These are real practical results for customers, and there are many more examples \nlike them. Because of its advantaged capabilities, security, operational performance and customer focus, AWS continues to earn most of the big enterprise and \ngovernment transformations to the cloud. As a result, AWS is where the preponderance of company's data and workloads reside and part of why most companies \nwant to run AI and AWS. To enable customers to do so, we need to have the requisite capacity, and we've been focused on accelerating capacity the last several \nmonths, adding more than 3.8 gigawatts of power in the past 12 months, more than any other cloud provider. To put that into perspective, we're now double the \npower capacity that AWS was in 2022, and we're on track to double again by 2027. In the last quarter of this year alone, we expect to add at least another 1 \ngigawatt of power. This capacity consists of power, data center and chips, primarily our custom silicon, Trainium and NVIDIA.

Trainium2 continues to\nsee strong adoption, is fully subscribed is now a multibillion-dollar business that grew 150% quarter-over-quarter. Today, Trainium is being used by a small\nnumber of very large customers but we expect to accommodate more customers starting with Trainium3. We're building Bedrock to be the biggest inference\nengine in the world and in the long run, believe Bedrock could be as big a business for AWS as EC2, and the majority of token usage in Amazon Bedrock is\nalready running on Trainium. We're also continuing to work closely with chip partners like NVIDIA, with whom we continue to order very significant amounts as\nwell as with AMD and Intel. These are very important partners with whom we expect to keep growing our relationships over time. You're going to see us continue\nto be very aggressive in investing in capacity because we see the demand. As fast as we're adding capacity right now, we're monetizing it. It's still quite early and\nrepresents an unusual opportunity for customers in AWS. I'll now turn to stores. Where the team continues to deliver and innovate for customers across our key\npriorities, selection, low prices and convenience, particularly fast delivery, we're offering 14% more selection since last quarter from popular brands like The North\nFace and Charlotte Tilbury, and we've added hundreds of thousands of items from popular brands this year. Everyday Essentials continues to grow quickly, and\nyear-to-date is growing nearly twice as fast as the rest of the business. We continue to make it easier for customers to order low-priced perishable groceries from\nAmazon, and customers in more than 1,000 cities and towns now can shop fresh groceries alongside millions of Amazon.com products with free same-day\ndelivery. This is a game changer for customers who can now order milk alongside electronics, check out with one cart and have everything delivered to their\ndoorstep within hours. The team also invented a new add to delivery button that lets customers add items to previously scheduled orders and it's been used more\nthan 80 million times since launch, and it's just launch. It's an example of one of those seemingly simple but powerful innovations that make customers' lives\neasier. We remain committed to staying sharp on price and meeting or beating prices of other major retailers. In July, we had our biggest Prime Day event ever,\nwith customers saving billions of dollars across more than 35 categories. We continue to break records on speed. We're on track to deliver at our fastest speeds\never for Prime members globally once again this year, and we've started rolling out 3-hour delivery in select U.S. cities. We're also continuing to invest in\ninfrastructure to speed up rural deliveries and serve more customers in more communities. That includes committing over $4 billion to expand our rural delivery\nnetwork across the U.S. These are small towns where people want fast delivery, but where other companies have been backing out and reducing service. In\ncontrast, we've already increased the number of rural communities with access to our same-day and next-day delivery by 60%, reaching roughly half of the total\ncommunities we plan to expand to by the end of the year. The stores team is also innovating rapidly with AI. For example, Rufus, our AI-powered shopping\nassistant has had 250 million active customers this year with monthly users up 140% year-over-year, interactions up 210% year-over-year and customers using\nRufus during a shopping trip being 60% more likely to complete a purchase. Rufus is on track to deliver over $10 billion in incremental annualized sales. Here are\nthe highlights. Our generative AI-powered audio feature that combines product summaries and reviews to make shopping easier has expanded from hundreds of\nproducts at launch to millions of products and millions of customers have used it streaming almost 3 million minutes. In Amazon Lens, an AI-powered visual\nsearch tool that lets customers find products with their phones camera, a screenshot or a bar code, now includes Lens Live, which instantly scans products and\nshows real-time matches in a swipeable carousel. Tens and millions of customers are using Amazon Lens each month. Moving on to Amazon ads. We're pleased\nwith the continued strong growth, generating $17.6 billion of revenue in the quarter and growing 22% year-over-year. We see strength across our broad portfolio\nof full photo advertising offerings that helps advertisers reach an average ad-supported audience of more than $300 million in the U.S. alone. We also continue to\nbe excited about our demand side platform, Amazon DSP, which lets advertisers plan, activate and measure full funnel investments. Last quarter, I mentioned our\npartnership with Roku and we've built on that with a partnership with Netflix, providing advertisers using Amazon DSP with direct access to Netflix's premium ad\ninventory. We announced integrations with Spotify and SiriusXM. With Spotify, we provide advertisers with direct programmatic access to a global audience of\nmore than 400 million monthly ad-supported listeners. And with SiriusXM, brands can reach 160 million monthly digital listeners across services like Pandora and\nSoundCloud and we're excited about the advertising opportunity around prime video live sports. Live sports got a lot of interest from advertisers in upfront\nnegotiations for 2025, '26, and we exceeded our own expectations for upfront commitments with significant growth across the board. Finally, we're continuing to\ninvade for advertisers with AI. For example, in September, we announced an agentic AI tool and creative studio that plans and executes the entire creative\nprocess in a matter of hours instead of weeks. We're also inventing and seeing strong momentum in several other areas, and I'll mention just a few. In Prime\nVideo live sports, NBA on Prime tipped off last week and our opening night doubleheader averaged 1.25 million viewers in the U.S., a double-digit increase over\nlast season on cable. You'll see us bring the same constant innovation here that we brought to our NFL broadcast. We're adding golf with The Masters in 2026\nand new skins competition with the PGA Tour on Black Friday this year. And we've added Peacock and FOX One to Prime Videos add-on subscription offering of\nover 100 channels in the U.S. We continue to be energized by the response to Alexa+ compared to what we call the classic Alexa experience, Alexa+ customers\nare talking to Alexa 2x more. Those interactions are much longer, and they're covering a broader range of topics. So using Alexa+ and Fire TV at 2.5x the rate of\nclassic using natural conversation to discover audio content 4x more, engaging with photos 4x more and customers are completing 4x more shopping\nconversations that end in a purchase. We've expanded the number of project hyper satellites and space to more than 150 and delivered over 1 gigabit per second\nspeeds and test with our enterprise-grade customer terminal, the first commercial phased array we know of to clear that threshold. Finally, Zoox robotaxis are\navailable to riders in Las Vegas, and we've announced Washington, D.C. as the eighth testing location. We're excited for these to continue rolling out to more\nriders. Q4 is one of our busiest and most energizing times of the year, and we're excited about the continued demand for AWS. The innovations will announce the\nreinvent in December, the positive customer response to our AI-powered experiences, all the guests will be delivering throughout the holiday season and a lot\nmore. Thanks in advance to our teammates around the world who are gearing up to deliver for customers once again.

Starting with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $180.2 billion, a 12% increase year-over-year, excluding a 90 basis point \nfavorable impact of foreign exchange. In Q3, we reported worldwide operating income of $17.4 billion. This operating income includes 2 special charges, which \nreduced operating income by $4.3 billion. The first charge of $2.5 billion is related to a legal settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which impacts the \nNorth America segment and is recorded in the other operating expense line. The second charge of $1.8 billion relates to severance costs for roll eliminations and \nimpacts all 3 of our segments. The severance charge is recorded primarily in the technology and infrastructure, sales and marketing and general and \nadministrative expense line items. Excluding these 2 charges, worldwide operating income would have been $21.7 billion or $1.2 billion above the high end of our \nguidance range. Moving to our segment results. We remain encouraged by the innovation our teams are delivering for customers across all 3 segments. In the \nNorth America segment, third quarter revenue was $106.3 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. International segment revenue was $40.9 billion, an \nincrease of 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Worldwide paid units grew 11% year-over-year. We continue to prioritize the inputs \nthat matter most to our customers. In the third quarter, our sharp pricing, broad selection and fast delivery speeds continue to resonate with customers. \nCustomers appreciate the ability to quickly receive items essential for their daily needs, including perishable groceries and have them delivered in the same day. \nOur millions of global third-party sellers continue to be important contributors to our vast selection, which helps customers find the items they need at competitive \nprices. We're committed to building innovative services and features for our sellers, including our ongoing advancements in generative AI. Today, more than 1.3 \nmillion sellers have used our generative AI capabilities to more quickly launch high-quality listings. Better listings translate into better traction with customers. And\n\nin Q3, worldwide third-party seller unit mix was 62%, up 200 basis points from Q3 of last year. Shifting to profitability. North America segment operating income\nwas $4.8 billion, with an operating margin of 4.5%. Excluding the $2.5 billion charge related to the legal settlement with the FTC, North America segment\noperating income would have been $7.3 billion with an operating margin of 6.9%. North America segment operating margin also includes a portion of the\nseverance charge. International segment operating income was $1.2 billion, with an operating margin of 2.9%. Excluding the impact of the severance charge\nInternational segment operating margins expanded year-over-year. Globally, our progress on key inputs is delivering a better customer experience while driving a\nmore efficient cost structure. For example, we're making notable strides in improving inventory placement to speed up delivery to customers. And as a result, for\nthe third year in a row, we are on track to deliver our fastest speeds ever for Prime members in 2025. We continue to tune and improve our fulfillment operations\nand our regionalized network is operating at scale. We see many benefits of our inbound process improvements, including a reduction of U.S. inbound lead time\nby nearly 4 days compared to last year. This allows us to be more efficient with our inventory purchasing, which benefits working capital. We're also placing\ninventory more strategically throughout the network. And by leveraging our existing infrastructure, we're now offering U.S. customers the ability to order\nperishable groceries and receive them the same day and as little as 5 hours. We're seeing positive early results since launching in January, when customers start\nshopping groceries on Amazon, they are visiting the site more often and returning twice as often as nonperishable shoppers. Looking ahead, we see further\nopportunity to improve our activity in our global fulfillment and transportation network. We continue to improve inventory placement to drive down distance travel\nand touches for package. We will also build on the gains from our regionalized network through algorithmic improvements as well as launching robotics and\nautomation. Operating margin may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we have a delivered approach to achieve sustained progress over the long term. Shifting to\nadvertising. Advertising revenue was $17.7 billion and growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter. We continue to see strong growth on an increasingly\nlarge base, as our full funnel advertising approach of connecting brands with customers is resonating. Moving next to our AWS segment. Revenue was $33\nbillion, up 20.2% year-over-year. This is an acceleration of 270 basis points compared to last quarter, driven by strong growth across both our AI and core\nservices and more capacity, which has come online to support customer demand. AWS revenue increased $2.1 billion quarter-over-quarter and now has an\nannualized revenue run rate of $132 billion. AWS operating income was $11.4 billion, and reflects our continued growth, coupled with our focus on driving\nefficiencies across the business. We are expanding our data center footprint, largely to accommodate Gen AI. And to the extent those assets were placed into\nservice related to depreciation does impact our margins. As we've long said, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level\nof investments we're making at any point in time. Now turning to our cash CapEx, which was $34.2 billion in Q3. We've now spent $89.9 billion so far this year.\nThis primarily relates to AWS as we invest to support demand for our AI and core services and in custom silicon, like Trainium as well as tech infrastructure to\nsupport our North America and international segments. We'll continue to make significant investments, especially in AI, as we believe it to be a massive\nopportunity with the potential for strong returns on invested capital over the long term. Additionally, we continue to invest in our fulfillment and transportation\nnetwork to support the growth of the business, improve delivery speeds and lower our cost to serve. These investments will support growth for many years to\ncome. Looking ahead, we expect our full year cash CapEx to be approximately $125 billion in 2025, and we expect that amount will increase in 2026. I'll finish up\nmy remarks with net income. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, our third quarter net income of $21.2 billion includes a pretax gain of\n$9.5 billion related to our investment in Anthropic. This investment activity is not related to Amazon's ongoing operations and is included in nonoperating income.\nWe're encouraged by the start of the peak season and we are ready to serve customers in the coming months. I want to thank our teams across Amazon for their\nhard work as we get ready to delight customers during the holiday season. Our commitment to elevating the customer experience is the only reliable way to drive\nsustainable value for our shareholders.

So we're bringing in quite a bit of capacity today,\noverall in the industry, maybe the bottleneck is power. I think at some point, it may move to chips, but we're bringing in quite a bit of capacity. And as fast as we're\nbringing in right now, we are monetizing it.

We have -- it's a multibillion-dollar business at this point. It grew 150% quarter-over-quarter in revenue. And\nyou see really big projects at scale now, like our Project Rainier that we're doing with Anthropic, where they're running their next version of -- they're training the\nnext version of Claude on top of Trainium2 on 500,000 Trainium2 chips going to 1 million Trainium2 chips by the end of the year. As I mentioned, we have --\ntoday, with Trainium2, we have a small number of very large customers on it. But because Trainium is 30% to 40% more price performance than other options out\nthere, and because as customers, as they start to contemplate broader scale of their production workloads, moving to being AI-focused and using inference, they\nbadly care about price performance. And so we have a lot of demand for Trainium.

So how do you think about the key hurdles of Trainium3 need to overcome to really make Trainium adoption broader,\nto your point on the last question and continue to drive Trainium as opposed to satisfying what could be broader demand with third-party chips in the near term?", "char_count": 483, "word_count": 83, "token_count": 103, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "AMZN_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q3_u_0006", "company": "AMZN", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2025, "period": "2025-Q3", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/AMZN/AMZN_FY2025_Q3.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

Well, first of all, we're always going to have multiple chip options for our customers. It's been true in every major technology building block or component that\nwe've had in AWS. Really in the history of AWS, it's never just one player that over a long period of time has the entire market segment and then can satisfy\neverybody's needs on every dimension. And so we have a very deep relationship with NVIDIA. We have for a very long time. And we will for as long as I can\nforesee the future. We buy a lot of NVIDIA. We are not constrained in any way in buying NVIDIA, and I expect that we'll continue to buy more NVIDIA both next\nyear and in the future. But we're different from most technology companies in that we have our own very strong chip team, and this is our Annapurna team. And\nyou saw it first on the CPU side with what we built with Graviton which is about 40% better price performance than the other x86 processors, and you're seeing it\nagain on the custom silicon on the AI side with Trainium, which is about the same amount of price performance benefit for customers relative to other GPU\noptions. And our customers to be able to use AI as expansively as they want. And remember, it's still relatively early days at this point. They're going to need\nbetter price performance and they care about it deeply. And so I mentioned earlier the momentum that Trainium2 has. And I think that for us, as we think about\nTrainium3, I expect Trainium3 will be about 40% better than Trainium2 and Trainium2 is already very advantaged on price performance. So we have to, of\ncourse, deliver the chip. We have to deliver it in volumes and deliver it quickly. And we have to continue to work on the software ecosystem, which gets better all\nthe time. And as we have more proof points like we have with Project Rainier with what Anthropic's doing on Trainium2, it builds increasing credibility for\nTrainium. And I think customers are very bullish about it. I'm bullish about it as well.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.", "char_count": 2071, "word_count": 376, "token_count": 472, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "AMZN_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q3_u_0007", "company": "AMZN", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2025, "period": "2025-Q3", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/AMZN/AMZN_FY2025_Q3.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

And it's not simple to be able to build a cluster that has 500,000 plus chips going to 1 million. That's an infrastructure\nfeet that's hard to do at scale. And so some piece of it is the infrastructure capabilities that we've built over a long period of time in AWS that is unusual in the\nindustry. But it's just also the performance of the chip and the price performance, both of which matter. And I think that Project Rainier is something that is specific\nfor anthropic, but we have a lot of other customers who are interested in employing large clusters of Trainium chips that we're going to hopefully give them a\nchance to do so with Trainium3.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.", "char_count": 943, "word_count": 174, "token_count": 215, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "AMZN_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q3_u_0009", "company": "AMZN", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2025, "period": "2025-Q3", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/AMZN/AMZN_FY2025_Q3.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

So I'll start with grocery, Mark. We have a very large grocery business. If you look at our entire grocery business, if I don't even count Whole Foods Market \nand Fresh, in the last 12 months to over $100 billion of gross merchandising sales, which would make us a top 3 grocery in the U.S. A good chunk of it is a lot of \nthe items that you'd find in the middle aisle so consumables and canned goods and pet food and health and beauty, very significant and continues to grow at a \nvery good clip. But then we also have Whole Foods Market, which is the pioneer in organic foods, which is also growing at a faster clip than most grocery \ncompanies with an attractive trajectory on profitability, and we'll expand our Whole Foods physical presence over the coming years here. And I'm also very \nexcited about this new concept, daily shop that we have, which is a smaller version of Whole Foods in urban settings, which we have 3 that we've launched that \nare off to very good starts that you should expect to see more of as well. And we have always been -- as you referenced, we've talked a lot about having a larger \nmass physical presence. And we continue to experiment with various formats. But the one that we are most excited about is what you referenced, which is the \nability to provide perishable groceries with same-day deliveries. And if you think about how many of our customers are buying from us multiple times a week and \nwho are buying things like shampoo or detergent or paper cups or water, where the ability to add milk and eggs and yogurt and other perishables to their order \nand have it live in the same shop in cart and then show up a few hours later, is very compelling. And we started with a few markets about a year ago, and we \nwere really taken aback at the adoption, not just the number of people that started buying perishables from us very quickly but how often they came back \ndownstream to buy perishables and groceries from us in the future. And so we've now expanded that to 1,000 cities around the U.S. and will be in 2,300 by the \nend of the year. And it's really changing the trajectory and the size of our grocery business. And I also believe that this many years tradition of the weekly stock up \ngrocery stock up is changing. And I think we're a big part of that. And I think there's a lot of potential there for the grocery side. It doesn't mean that we won't \ncontinue to experiment with other physical formats, but we're on to something very significant with what we're doing with perish both from our same-day facilities. \nAnd then on your head count question, what I would tell you is the announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven and it's not even \nreally AI-driven, not right now, at least. It really -- its culture. And if you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the \nnumber of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers. And \nwhen that happens, sometimes without realizing that you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work and who own \nmost of the 2-way door decisions, the ones that should be made quickly and right at the front line, and it can lead to slowing you down. And as a leadership team, \nwe are committed to operating like the world's largest start-up. And that means removing layers. It means increasing the amount of ownership that people have, \nand it means inventing and moving quickly. And I don't know if there's ever been a time in the history of Amazon or maybe business in general with the\n\ntechnology transformation happening right now, where it's important to be lean, it's important to be flat, and it's important to move fast, and that's what we're going\nto do.\nOperator\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.", "char_count": 3954, "word_count": 725, "token_count": 869, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "AMZN_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q3_u_0012", "company": "AMZN", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2025, "period": "2025-Q3", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/AMZN/AMZN_FY2025_Q3.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

And I think if you're -- if you know what you want to buy, there are a few experiences that are better\nthan coming to Amazon. But if you don't know what you want, it's a physical store with a physical salesperson still has some advantages. Obviously, lots of\npeople do it on Amazon all the time. But you very often want to ask questions and help get help narrowing what you're going to look for. And as you keep asking\nnew questions, having a whole bunch of different options presented to you. And I think AI and agentic commerce are going to change the experience online\nwhere that experience where you're narrowing what you want when you don't know is going to get better online than it even is in physical environments. Now we\nobviously have our own efforts here in agentic commerce. We have Rufus, which I talked about in my opening comments, which is continuing to get better and\nbetter and used more broadly. And we have features like Buy for Me where we will surface on Amazon, even items that we don't stock that other merchants have.\nAnd then if customers want us to go and buy it for them on those merchants websites, we will do that. And both of those have been successful for us. But we're\nalso having conversations with and expect over time to partner with third-party agents. And I think that it reminds me in some ways of the beginning of search\nengines many years ago being sources of discovery for commerce. And you had to kind of figure out the right way to work together. And today, search engines\nare a very small part of our referral traffic and third-party agents are a very small subset of that. But I do think that we will find ways to partner. We have to find a\nway, though, that makes the customer experience good. Right now, I would say the customer experience is not -- there's no personalization. There's no shopping\nhistory. The delivery estimates are frequently wrong. The prices are often wrong. So we've got to find a way to make the customer experience better and have the\nright exchange value. But I do think that the exciting part of this and the promise is that AI and agentic commerce solutions are going to expand the amount of\nshopping that happens online. And I think that's really good for customers, and I think it's really good for Amazon because at the end of the day, you're going to\nbuy from the outfit that allows you to have the broadest selection, great value and continues to deliver for you very quickly and reliably.

And we have momentum. You can see it. And we see the growth in both our AI area, where we see it in inference. We see it in training. We see it in the \nuse of our Trainium custom silicon. Bedrock continues to grow really quickly. SageMaker continues to grow quickly. And I think that the number of companies who \nare working on building agents is very significant. I do believe that a lot of the value that companies will realize over time and AI will come from agents. And I think \nthat building agents today is still harder than it should be. You need tools to make it easier, which is why we built strands, which is an open source capability that \nlets people build agents from any model that they can imagine. But even more so, when you talk to enterprises or companies that care a lot about security and\n\nscale. They're starting to build agents, and they don't really feel like they've got -- they've had building blocks that allow them to have the type of secure scalable\nagents that they need to bet their businesses and their customer experience and their data. And that's why -- that was really the inspiration behind AgentCore\nwas to build another set of primitive building blocks like we built in the early days of AWS, where it was compute and storage and database. We defined a set of\nbuilding blocks that you needed to be able to deploy agents securely and scalably that we provide in AgentCore. And then when we talk to our customers, it really\nresonates. There is not anything else like it, it's changing their time frame and their receptivity to building agents, and it's very compelling for them. So I do think\nthe combination of what we're doing to enable agents to be built and run securely and scalably as well as some of the agents that we're building ourselves that\nour customers are excited about are compelling for them. And I think the other place we see a lot of growth in AWS also is just the number of enterprises who are\n-- who have gotten back to moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. And we continue to earn the lion's share of those transformations. And I look at\nthe momentum we have right now, and I believe that we can continue to grow at a clip like this for a while. I think on the advertising side, that is also an area\nwhere I think collectively, we feel very pleased about the progress. Every single one of our advertising offerings this quarter grew in a meaningful way. I think\nthere's a few things going on for us. We have what I think of as a pretty unusual full funnel offering. And if you look at the top of the funnel, which typically tends to\nbe awareness building and broad scale to be able to use our own Prime Video and our live sports capabilities as well as going all the way down to the bottom of\nthe funnel at point of sale being able to use sponsored products, that's -- most people don't have a full funnel offering as robust as that. And then when you layer\non top of it, the combination of the audience curation and development we can do, along with the advantage measurement, it just all leads to a return on\nadvertising spend is very unusual. And I think there are multiple places where we can expect to continue to grow. One is in our stores business. I still think if you\nlook at the worldwide market segment share of retail, still 80% to 85% of it lives in physical stores. And that equation is going to flip over time. And I think AI is\ngoing to only accelerate that. So I think we have an opportunity -- a significant opportunity still in our existing stores. And then I think video, we've only been at\nthis for a little bit of time, but it's already a very large amount of advertising revenue, and we're still relatively early stage. I think that will continue to be a big area\nof growth. And then as you referenced, the amount -- their demand-side platform or Amazon DSP, that is growing really quickly as well. And some of it had to do\nwith the fact that we had some features. We always had a number of the core components people wanted around some of our properties, the measurement\ncapabilities, Amazon Marketing Cloud, but we lack some features for a while as we were building out our DSP that customers told us mattered and the team over\nthe last 20 months have closed those gaps in a very significant way so that now people feel like our DSP is fully featured. And then you look at some of the\npartnerships that we've done, the Roku partnership gives us the largest connected TV footprint in the U.S. And you layer on top of that, what we've recently done\nin providing our DSP customers, the opportunity to integrate with the ad inventory in Netflix and Spotify and SiriusXM, it's powerful. And so we are growing very\nquickly on the demand side platform. So very optimistic about what we're doing there.
