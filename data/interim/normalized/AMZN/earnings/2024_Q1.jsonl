First, we saw\nan impact from leap year in Q1, which added approximately 120 basis points to the year-over-year quarterly revenue growth rate.\nWe remain focused on the inputs that matter most to our customers\nselection, price, and convenience. During the quarter, around the world, we helped customers save with our shopping events. We added selection, including\npremium and luxury brands, and we delivered our fastest speeds ever for Prime members. Third-party sellers continue to be an important part of our offering.\nThird-party seller services revenue increased 16% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
