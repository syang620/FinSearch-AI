## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Brian Nowak (Morgan Stanley)**: Thanks for taking my questions. First, thank you Ruth for all the help and significant impact over the past decade. The first one, it is a little bit of a jump ball, I 
guess for Sundar, Philipp or Ruth. I guess we're sort of 18 months this fever pitch around the GenAI focus in the world. Maybe from any of your perspective, can 
you just sort of talk to us about areas where you've seen faster than expected traction or testing adoption of some of the AI, generative AI capabilities versus 
slower than expected traction and testing from a Google perspective. And then, Ruth I appreciate all the comments about structurally reengineering the OpEx 
base. Are there any more tangible examples of areas you can talk to us about where you still see further ways to drive more efficiency across the company.

Thanks.

### Exchange 002

**Brian Nowak (Morgan Stanley)**: Great. Thank you both.

Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.

### Exchange 003

**Doug Anmuth (JPMorgan)**: Thanks for taking my questions. One for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth you've now had Google Services operating margins roughly 40% for the past two
quarters. Just as you create more capacity to help offset the future investments, is it reasonable to think that you could sustain at those kind of levels going
forward? And then, Sundar just as it relates to AI overviews, you talked about the positive trends there. Can you just help us understand where you are, how far
along in rolling-out AI overviews and then any more color around kind of click-through rates and monetization levels relative to your traditional searches. Thanks.

### Exchange 004

**Doug Anmuth (JPMorgan)**: Thank you. Best of luck, Ruth, in your new role.

### Exchange 005

**Eric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs)**: Thanks so much. And I'll echo the thanks for Ruth, for all the insights and partnership over the years on these earnings calls. Sundar maybe first for you, in terms
of Cloud and bringing AI to the enterprise, I wanted to know if you go a little bit deeper in terms of how you are seeing AI actually get adopted implemented, what
it potentially could mean for the strategic positioning of the cloud business and the potential for AI workloads to be a stimulant to revenue growth for Cloud first.
And then following up the last set of questions on YouTube are really about the macro or the ad environment. What do you guys, as a team, continue to learn
about the subscription side of YouTube and the appetite for consumers to engage with a broader array of media products at the subscription layer. Thanks.

### Exchange 006

**Eric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs)**: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open.

### Exchange 007

**Ross Sandler (Barclays)**: Hi, everybody. Just two questions on the AI CapEx. So it looks like from the outside at least, the hyperscaler industry is going from kind of an under bill situation
this time last year to better meeting the demand with capacity right now to potentially being overbuilt next year if these CapEx growth rates keep up. So do you
think that's a fair characterization? And how are we thinking about the return on invested capital with this AI CapEx cycle. And then related to that, do you think
that the AI industry is close to or far away from hitting some kind of wall on foundation model improvement in AI training, based on like lack of availability of new
data to train on. Just your thoughts on that would be great. Thank you.

### Exchange 008

**Ross Sandler (Barclays)**: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with UBS. Your line is now open.

### Exchange 009

**Stephen Ju (UBS)**: Okay. Thank you so much. So Sundar, I guess to ask the AI question a different way. As we talk to some of the model builders out there, it looks like the initial
use cases are more on the cost savings or efficiency side. But when do we -- when do you think we'll start thinking about products that can help revenue
generation for the Fortune 500, Fortune 1000 companies, which is probably something that can hopefully create greater value over time versus just cutting costs?

### Exchange 010

**Stephen Ju (UBS)**: Okay. Thank you.

And our last question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is now open.

### Exchange 011

**Justin Post (Bank of America)**: Great. I'll ask a couple of areas. First on the cloud acceleration, would you characterize that as new AI demand helping drive that year-to-date? Or is that more of
a rebound in just general compute and other demand or is AI really moving this forward and helping drive acceleration. And then I wanted to ask about your
internal cost savings which has been really strong. How are you using AI internally to help cut costs? Are you seeing better efficiencies with your engineers? And
just would love to hear about how you are applying AI to cut your own costs? Thank you.

### Exchange 012

**Justin Post (Bank of America)**: Great, thank you.

Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.
