## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Brian Nowak (Morgan Stanley)**: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, one for Sundar, one for Anat. Sundar, maybe kind of step back on Search, there's a -- it seems like there's a lot of
advances to come with Gen AI and agentic possibilities with Search. Can you just sort of walk us through your big picture vision over the next few years of how
you think about your Search product continue to evolve to stay at the top of the funnel and drive more engagement and monetization for your users and
advertisers. And then the second one, Anat, I think about 90 days ago, you talked about sort of further efficiencies and areas of simplification on the OpEx space.
Can you just sort of walk us through some examples of where you see the potential for further efficiencies to the OpEx space, excluding the DNA step-ups that
we have to come in 2025. Thanks.

### Exchange 002

**Doug Anmuth (JPMorgan)**: Thanks for taking the questions, one for Philipp and one for Anat. Philipp, can you just talk more about the expanded rollout of ads on AI overviews and perhaps
what additional things you may have learned in 4Q? And I guess in particular, just curious if you rolled out to a higher percentage of commercial queries and is it
still fair to say that you're monetizing nearly on par with existing search? And then Anat, just on the -- on cloud growth, a little bit of decel 3Q to 4Q, but it sounded
like you also suggested that your capacity constrained in the fourth quarter. I just wanted to push on that a little bit more. How -- is that accurate and is it fair to
say that revenue growth could have been higher with much more capacity? Thanks.

### Exchange 003

**Doug Anmuth (JPMorgan)**: Thank you both.

Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.

### Exchange 004

**Eric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs)**: Thank you for taking the question. I'll just ask one. Sundar, with the news that came out of China a little over 2 weeks ago, I think investors have been asking a lot
of questions about the long-term cost curve for AI as AI moves from the infrastructure layer to the application layer or from training to inference and maybe even
custom silicon becomes more dominant across the theme. I would love to get your perspective on your take on that news a couple of weeks ago and what it might
mean for Alphabet longer term. Thank you.

### Exchange 005

**Eric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs)**: Thank you.

Your next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.

### Exchange 006

**Mark Shmulik (Bernstein)**: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Sundar, I just wanted to follow-up to Brian's question from earlier. With your own Project Mariner efforts and a competitor's
recent launch, it seems there's suddenly really strong momentum on AI consumer agents and kind of catching up to that old Google duplex vision. I think when
you look a few years ahead, where do you see consumer agents going and really, what does it mean to Google Search outside of Lens? Is there room for both to
flourish or will they eventually be in conflict with each other? Thank you.

### Exchange 007

**Ross Sandler (Barclays)**: Great. One on infrastructure and then one on the guidance on revenue. So Sundar, if we look at the inference cost per 1 million tokens and not the API pricing we
see for Gemini versus something like GPT-4, but the raw cost of generating inference tokens on your TPU stack. How much more efficient do you think you guys
are in terms of generating 1 million tokens compared to inference costs running on your cloud peers? Do you see this as an advantage as everything shifts to
inference? And then Anat, you call out lapping the financial services category strength in 2025 as a bit of a problem for Search. Could you just quantify a little bit
of that? Is that kind of the same as when you guys talk about lapping the Asia outbound advertiser channel? Any numbers you could put around that headwind?
Thank you very much.

### Exchange 008

**Justin Post (Bank of America)**: Great. Thank you. A couple for Philipp. You mentioned higher search usage with overviews. Just wondering how you're feeling about overall Search usage. Is it
accelerating as you integrate more AI? I know there's a lot of traffic growth at competitors with AI, but just wondering if you're seeing a real increase in total
volumes of information gathering. And then second, on YouTube, thinking about kind of maybe a move from more professional content to user-generated content,
what is that doing for your usage, and how do you think about the margin impact from that? Thank you.

### Exchange 009

**Justin Post (Bank of America)**: Thank you.

And our last question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.

### Exchange 010

**Ken Gawrelski (Wells Fargo)**: Thank you very much. Two, please. I want to focus on Gemini and the consumer agent side. Sundar, there was some press reports that suggested you have an
ambitious goal on growing the usage by the end of '25. Two questions on that, please. First, what’s -- how should we think about the approach that you're going to
employ to achieve this goal? Is it more aggressive marketing for Gemini as a standalone product, or is it tighter integration into existing experiences, whether it be
search mail, maps, et cetera. And then the second one is, how should we think about the future monetization opportunity of Gemini? Today, it's really a premium
subscription offering or a free offering. Over time, do you see an ad component and anything you can share on that, please? Thank you.

### Exchange 011

**Ken Gawrelski (Wells Fargo)**: Thank you.

Thank you and that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.
