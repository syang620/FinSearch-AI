## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Brian Nowak (Morgan Stanley)**: I have two for Philipp. Philipp, the first one is about sort of a lot of the new generative AI advertising tools. You obviously have a lot of irons in the fire here. You've
been talking about some of the early momentum with tens of thousands of advertisers. The question is, can you sort of walk us through some of the hurdles and
gating factors that we should be thinking through that dictate the pace at which these tools can really be rolled out broadly just so we and advertisers can kind of
get an understanding for when they could have a bigger impact on the whole business? And then secondly, how do you think about the long-term sales force
intensity of the advertising business as you roll more AI-based tools like PMax impacting the overall ad allocation?

### Exchange 002

**Doug Anmuth (JPMorgan)**: One for Ruth and one for Philipp. Ruth, you're now into year two of durably reengineering your cost structure. Can you just help us assess your progress so far?
And are there any guideposts that we should be thinking about going forward? And then, Philipp, can you talk more about NFL Sunday Ticket and just what your
key learnings were in year one? How are you thinking about the returns on the investment on both from an advertising perspective and then also subscribers to
both Sunday Ticket and YouTube TV?

### Exchange 003

**Eric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs)**: Two, if I could. Sundar, a bigger-picture question, coming back to your comments earlier in the call on Search Generative Experience. When you think about the
evolution of product over the next couple of years, how do you envision more traditional search and things like the Google Assistant continuing to evolve in a
world of Search Generative Experience and Bard and what that might mean for elements of commercial and non-commercial search and how use cases might
change in the years ahead? And then, Ruth, I just want to make sure we understood some of the messaging from the release and the public comments around
one-timers in the quarter itself. It seems as if they were not allocated to the segments but are more elements of Other Bets and Alphabet-level activities. I just
want to confirm whether elements of those one-timers were captured in the P&L statement and whether there were also any elements of legal one-timers that
would be called out this quarter as well?

### Exchange 004

**Ross Sandler (Barclays)**: So I guess a question for, I don't know if Sundar or Philipp. But if we go back to the DOJ trial that happened in the fall, there was a document that was disclosed
from Google that said something along the lines of why being on ad quality team to deliver 20% RPM growth in Search is a fragile strategy. Digging back to 2019,
your business has, I think, more than doubled since then. So I guess, as we sit here today in early 2024, how do you feel about Google's ability to drive Search
RPM going forward? And I guess in the context of what Ruth said tonight about the large revenue base, just how do you feel about the monetization?

### Exchange 005

**Mark Mahaney (Evercore)**: One question on YouTube AI and one on Cloud. On Cloud first, there's just this volatility, this material deceleration last quarter and the nice reacceleration this
quarter. Is that explained by where we are in the optimization cycle, and it may be generative AI workloads starting to trickle in now and cause that growth curve
to bend back up? Any commentary just on the sort of the volatility, the deceleration and the reacceleration that we've seen? And then, Philipp, I wanted to ask on
the creative side, and particularly on YouTube and ads and the creative, using AI to improve the creative and really to offer SMBs who have been with Google
forever but offer them now performance-based video ad campaigns created by AI. Is that kind of a new growth area? How far along are you in terms of offering
this out into the market? And do you think that this opens up a new area of spend that wasn't there before?
