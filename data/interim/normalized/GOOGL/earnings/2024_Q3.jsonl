Q3 was another great quarter. The momentum across the company is extraordinary, as you've seen in recent product \nlaunches, and as you will hear on the call today. Our commitment to innovation as well as a long-term focus and investment in AI are paying off and driving \nsuccess for the company and for our customers. We are uniquely positioned to lead in the era of AI because of our differentiated full stack approach to AI \ninnovation, and we are now seeing this operate at scale. It has three components. First, a robust AI infrastructure that includes data centers, chips and a global \nfiber network. Second, world-class research teams who are advancing our work with deep technical AI research and who are also building the models that power \nour efforts. And third, a broad global reach through products and platforms that touch billions of people and customers around the world, creating a virtuous cycle. \nLet me quickly touch on each of these. We continue to invest in state-of-the-art infrastructure to support our AI efforts from the U.S. to Thailand to Uruguay. We \nare also making bold clean energy investments, including the world's first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors, \nwhich will enable up to 500 megawatts of new 24/7 carbon-free power. We are also doing important work inside our data centers to drive efficiencies while \nmaking significant hardware and model improvements. For example, we shared that since we first began testing AI Overviews, we have lowered machine cost \nper query significantly. In 18 months, we reduced cost by more than 90% for these queries through hardware, engineering and technical breakthroughs while \ndoubling the size of our custom Gemini model. And of course, we use and offer our customers a range of AI accelerator options, including multiple classes of \nNVIDIA GPUs and our own custom-built TPUs. We are now on the sixth generation of TPUs known as Trillium and continue to drive efficiencies and better \nperformance with them. Turning to research. Our team at Google DeepMind continues to drive our leadership. Let me take a moment to congratulate Demis \nHassabis and John Jumper on winning the Noble Prize in chemistry for their work on AlphaFold. This is an extraordinary achievement and underscores the \nincredible talent we have and how critical our world-leading research is to the modern AI revolution and to our future progress. Also, congratulations to Jeff \nVinton, who spent over a decade here on winning the Noble Prize in physics. Our research teams also drive our industry-leading Gemini model capabilities, \nincluding long context understanding, multimodality and agentive capabilities. By any measure, token volume, API calls, consumer usage, business adoption, \nusage of the Gemini models is in a period of dramatic growth. And our teams are actively working on performance improvements and new capabilities for our \nrange of models. Stay tuned. And they are building out experiences where AI can see and reason about the world around you. Project Astra is a glimpse of that \nfuture. We are working to ship experiences like this as early as 2025. We then work to bring those advances to consumers and businesses. Today, all seven of \nour products and platforms with more than 2 billion monthly users use Gemini models. That includes the latest product to surpass the 2 billion user milestone \nGoogle Maps. Beyond Google's own platforms, following strong demand, we are making Gemini even more broadly available to developers. Today, we shared \nthat Gemini is now available on GitHub Copilot with more to come. To support our investments across these three pillars, we are organizing the company to \noperate with speed and agility. We recently moved the Gemini app team to Google DeepMind to speed up deployment of new models and streamline \npost-training work. This follows other structural changes that have unified teams in research, machine learning infrastructure and our developer teams, as well as \nour security efforts and our platforms and devices team. This is all helping us move faster. For instance, it was a small dedicated team that built Notebook LM, an \nincredibly popular product that has so much promise. We're also using AI internally to improve our coding processes, which is boosting productivity and efficiency. \nToday, more than a quarter of all new code at Google is generated by AI, then reviewed and accepted by engineers. This helps our engineers do more and move \nfaster. I'm energized by our progress and the opportunities ahead, and we continue to be laser-focused on building great products. Let me turn now to the \nquarterly highlights. In search, recent advancements, including AI Overviews, Circle to Search and new features in Lens are transforming the user experience, \nexpanding what people can search for and how they search for it. This leads to users coming to search more often for more of their information needs, driving \nadditional search queries. Just this week, AI Overview started rolling out to more than 100 new countries and territories. It will now reach more than 1 billion users \non a monthly basis. We are seeing strong engagement, which is increasing overall search usage and user satisfaction. People are asking longer and more \ncomplex questions and exploring a wider range of websites. What's particularly exciting is that this growth actually increases over time as people learn that \nGoogle can answer more of their questions. The integration of ads within AI Overviews is also performing well, helping people connect with businesses as they \nsearch. Circle to Search is now available on over 150 million Android devices with people using it to shop, translate text and learn more about the world around \nthem. A third of the people who have tried Circle to Search now use it weekly, a testament to its helpfulness and potential. Meanwhile, Lens is now used for over \n20 billion visual searches per month. Lens is one of the fastest-growing query types we see on search because of its ability to answer complex multimodal \nquestions and help in product discovery and shopping. For all these AI features, it's just the beginning, and you will see a rapid pace of innovation and progress \nhere. Next, Google Cloud. I'm very pleased with our growth. This business has real momentum and the overall opportunity is increasing as customers embrace \nGenAI. We generated Q3 revenues of $11.4 billion, up 35% over last year with operating margins of 17%. Our technology leadership and AI portfolio are helping \nus attract new customers, win larger deals and drive 30% deeper product adoption with existing customers. Customers are using our products in five different \nways. First, our AI infrastructure, which we differentiate with leading performance driven by storage, compute and software advances, as well as leading reliability \nand a leading number of accelerators. Using a combination of our TPUs and GPUs, LG AI research reduced inference processing time for its multimodal model \nby more than 50% and operating costs by 72%. Second, our enterprise AI platform, Vertex, is used to build and customize the best foundation models from \nGoogle and the industry. Gemini API calls have grown nearly 40x in a 6-month period. When Snap was looking to power more innovative experiences within their\n\nMy AI chatbot, they chose Gemini's strong multimodal capabilities. Since then, Snap saw over 2.5 times as much engagement with My AI in the United States.\nThird, customers use our AI platform together with our data platform, BigQuery, because we analyze multimodal data no matter where it is stored with ultra-low\nlatency access to Gemini. This enables accurate real-time decision-making for customers like Hiscox, one of the flagship syndicates in Lloyd's of London, which\nreduced the time it took to code complex risks from days to minutes. These types of customer outcomes, which combine AI with data science have led to 80%\ngrowth in BigQuery ML operations over a 6-month period. Fourth, our AI-powered cybersecurity solutions, Google Threat Intelligence and Security operations are\nhelping customers like BBVA and Deloitte prevent, detect and respond to cybersecurity threats much faster. We have seen customer adoption of our\nMandiant-powered threat detection increased 4x over the last 6 quarters. Fifth, in Q3, we broadened our applications portfolio with the introduction of our new\ncustomer engagement suite. It's designed to improve the customer experience online and in mobile apps, as well as in call centers, retail stores and more. A\ngreat example is Volkswagen of America, who is using this technology to power its new myVW Virtual Assistant. In addition, the employee agents we delivered\nthrough Gemini for Google Workspace are getting superb reviews. 75% of daily users say it improves the quality of their work. Moving now to YouTube. For the\nfirst time ever, YouTube's combined ad and subscription revenue over the past four quarters has surpassed $50 billion. Together, YouTube TV, NFL Sunday\nTicket and YouTube Music Premium are driving subscription growth for the platform. And we are leaning into the living room experience with multi-view and a\nnew option for creators to organize content into episodes and seasons, similar to traditional TV. At Made on YouTube, we announced that Google DeepMind's\nmost capable model for video generation VO is coming to YouTube Shorts to help creators later this year. Next, platforms and devices. Gemini's deep integration\nis improving Android. For example, Gemini Live lets you have free flowing conversations with Gemini. People love it. It's available on Android, including Samsung\nGalaxy devices. We continue to work closely with them to deliver innovations across their newest devices with much more to come. At Made by Google, we\nunveiled our latest Pixel 9 series of devices featuring advanced AI models, including Gemini Nano. We have seen strong demand for these devices, and they've\nalready received multiple awards. Turning to Other Bets. I want to highlight Waymo, the biggest part of our portfolio. Waymo is now a clear technical leader within\nthe autonomous vehicle industry and creating a growing commercial opportunity. Over the years, Waymo has been infusing cutting-edge AI into its work. Now\neach week, Waymo is driving more than 1 million fully autonomous miles and serves over 150,000 paid rides. The first time any AV company has reached this\nkind of mainstream use. Through its expanded network and operations partnership with Uber in Austin and Atlanta, plus a new multiyear partnership with\nHyundai, Waymo will bring fully autonomous driving to more people and places. By developing a universal driver, Waymo has multiple paths to market. And with\nits sixth generation system, Waymo significantly reduced unit costs without compromising safety. Before I close, I'm delighted to welcome our new CFO, Anat.\nWe are thrilled to have her on board, and you will hear from her shortly. And as always, I want to express my gratitude to our employees worldwide. Your\ndedication and hard work have made this another exceptional quarter for Alphabet. Now over to you, Philipp.", "char_count": 11264, "word_count": 1812, "token_count": 2255, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "GOOGL_TRANSCRIPT_2024_Q3_u_0001", "company": "GOOGL", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2024, "period": "2024-Q3", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/GOOGL/GOOGL_FY2024_Q3.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

I'll start with performance for the quarter and then describe the progress we're seeing across ads, YouTube and \npartnerships, highlighting the impact AI is already having on our business. Google Services delivered revenues of $76.5 billion for the quarter, up 13% \nyear-on-year. Search and other revenues grew 12% year-on-year, led by growth in the financial services vertical due to strength in insurance, followed by retail. \nYouTube ads revenues grew 12% year-on-year, driven by brand, closely followed by direct response. Network revenues were down 2% year-on-year. In \nsubscriptions, platforms and devices, year-on-year revenues were up 28%, driven by growth in subscriptions as well as the launch of our Made by Google \ndevices in the third quarter. Before I double-click into ads, YouTube and partnerships, a few comments on search. Whether they're using their voice to find \nanswers on the go or opening their camera to explore the world around them, people are expanding how they ask questions in search as well as the type of \nquestions they ask. New behaviors create new opportunities to help us connect businesses and consumers via amazing commercial experiences. As GenAI \nexpands what's possible, we continue to see a significant opportunity in search. Let me take a minute to explain why. AI really supercharges search. Our new \nAI-powered features make searches more helpful, and we continue to see great feedback, particularly from younger users. For example, with Circle to Search, \nwhere we see higher engagement from users aged 18 to 24. AI is expanding our ability to understand intent and connect it to our advertisers. This allows us to \nconnect highly relevant users with the most helpful ad and deliver business impact to our customers. Let me share two new ad experiences we have rolled out \nalongside our popular AI-powered features in search. First, as you heard from Sundar, every month, Lens is used for almost 20 billion visual searches with 1 in 4 \nof these searches having commercial intent. In early October, we announced product search on Google Lens. And in testing this feature, we found that shoppers \nare more likely to engage with content in this new format. We're also seeing that people are turning to Lens more often to run complex multimodal queries, voicing \na question or inputting text in addition to a visual. Given these new user behaviors, earlier this month, we announced the rollout of shopping ads above and \nalongside relevant Lens visual search results to help better connect consumers and businesses. Second, AI Overviews, where we have now started showing \nsearch and shopping ads within the overview for mobile users in the U.S. As you remember, we've already been running ads above and below AI Overviews. \nWe're now seeing that people find ads directly within AI Overviews helpful because they can quickly connect with relevant businesses, products and services to \ntake the next step at the exact moment they need. As I've said before, we believe AI will revolutionize every part of the marketing value chain. Let's start with \ncreative. Advertisers now use our Gemini-powered tools to build and test a larger variety of relevant creatives at scale. Audi used our AI tools to generate multiple \nvideo image and text assets in different links and orientations out of existing long-form videos. It then fed the newly generated creatives into demand gen to drive \nreach, traffic and booking to their driving experience. The campaign increased website visits by 80% and increased clicks by 2.7 times, delivering a lift in their \nsales. Last week, we updated image generation at Google Ads with our most advanced text-to-image model, Imagine 3, which we tuned using ads performance \ndata from multiple industries to help customers produce high-quality imagery for their campaigns. Advertisers can now create even higher-performing assets for \nPMax, Demand Gen app and Display campaigns. Turning to media buying. AI-powered campaigns help advertisers get faster feedback on what creatives work, \nwhere and redirect their media buying. Using Demand Gen, DoorDash tested a mix of image and video assets to drive more impact across Google and \nYouTube's visually immersive surfaces. They saw a 15 times higher conversion rate at a 50% more efficient cost per action when compared to video action \ncampaigns alone. Last and most importantly, measurement. This quarter, we extended availability of our open source marketing mix model, Meridian to more \ncustomers, helping to scale measurement of cross-channel budgets to drive better business outcomes. On YouTube, we remain focused on building a platform \nthat enables creators to thrive and unlocking a whole new world of creativity with AI. Creators are at the heart of the YouTube ecosystem and the content they are \nmaking is driving robust growth in watch time across the platform. We're also using AI to greatly improve recommendations on YouTube. Driven by Gemini, our \nlarge language models have a deeper understanding of video content and viewers' preferences. As a result, they can recommend more relevant, fresher and \npersonalized content to the viewer. Short-form creation continues to thrive on YouTube. Shorts monetization improved again this quarter, and we continue to \nsignificantly close the gap with in-stream video, particularly in the U.S. and other more highly monetizing markets. Of all the channels uploading to YouTube each \nmonth, 70% are uploading shorts. And we recently announced a top requested feature, the ability to upload shorts up to 3 minutes long. Also, advertisers can \nnow book first position on Shorts blocks in close to 40 markets. We're unlocking more opportunities in the living room. Our momentum here continues as we \nmaintain our status as the number one streamer in the U.S. according to Nielsen. This is driven by the strength of our creators, such as Michelle Carr and Rhett & \nLink, who are increasingly crafting experiences designed specifically for the big screen, and it's paying off. The number of creators making the majority of the \nYouTube revenue on TV screens is up more than 30% year-on-year. YouTube is becoming a premier destination for sports watching. People come for the game \nand stay for the commentary and around the game content from creators like Evelyn Gonzalez, Adam W and Brad Coleman. During the Olympics, content from\n\nParis 2024 had over 12 billion views on YouTube. More than 850 million unique viewers watched over 40 billion minutes of content with 35% on their TV screens.\nAnd recently, we kicked off our second season of NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube TV, which continues to receive a positive reception from advertisers, our\npartners at the NFL and fans. We have continued to invest in our product experience with improvements to multiview and deeper integrations for fantasy football\nfans. Following up on my remarks from last quarter about Brandcast, we had a strong upfront performance with commitments up about 20% year-on-year. As\nalways, let me wrap with the strong momentum we're seeing in partnerships. More and more of our partners are recognizing the breadth of our technologies and\nbuilding solutions that leverage the very best of Google. For example, our recently announced strategic partnership with Vodafone Group spans Google Cloud,\nAI, Android ads and digital services. This multibillion-dollar partnership will bring these technologies to more than 330 million customers across Europe and Africa.\nWe are collaborating on more than 30 initiatives across 7 areas, including generative AI from consumers, a best-in-class TV platform, hardware and\ncybersecurity. With that, a heartfelt thank you to Google everywhere for their extraordinary commitment and to our customers and partners for their continued\ncollaboration and trust. Anat, welcome to the team. It's great to have you with us.

My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I state \notherwise. I will start with the results at the Alphabet level and will then cover our segment results. I'll end with high-level commentary on investment at the \nAlphabet level. We had another strong quarter in Q3 with robust momentum across the business. Consolidated revenue increased by 15% or 16% in constant \ncurrency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth, followed by a robust 35% growth in cloud. Total cost of revenue was $36.5 billion, up 10%. \nTech was $13.7 billion, up 9%. We continue to see a revenue mix shift with Google Search growing at double-digit levels, while network revenue, which have a \nmuch higher TAC rate declined. Other cost of revenue was $22.8 billion, up 11%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition costs, primarily for \nYouTube, an increase in depreciation associated with higher level of investment in our technical infrastructure and higher hardware costs associated with the pull \nforward of our Made by Google launches from the fourth to the third quarter. Total operating expenses increased 5% to $23.3 billion. The increase was primarily \ndriven by facilities-related charges as results of actions were taken to further optimize our office space footprint globally, followed by depreciation, partially offset \nby year-on-year decline in charges for legal and other matters. R&D investments increased by 11%, primarily driven by increases in compensation and \ndepreciation expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased 5%, primarily reflecting investment in advertising and promotional efforts related to the Made by \nGoogle launches, as well as for AI and Gemini. G&A expenses declined by 10%, primarily due to lower charges for legal and other matters. Operating income \nincreased 34% to $28.5 billion and operating margin increased to 32%. Net income increased 34% to $26.3 billion and earnings per share increased 37% to \n$2.12. We're pleased with the progress we're making in reengineering our cost structure, which is reflected in our operating margin expansion this quarter, while \nalso continuing to invest in the business to bring innovation to consumers, creators and enterprises. We delivered free cash flow of $17.6 billion for the third \nquarter and $55.8 billion for the trailing 12 months. Year-on-year free cash flow was negatively impacted by the following items. In 2023, we deferred cash tax \npayments from the second and third quarter to the fourth quarter. And in Q3 2024, we made a $3 billion cash payment related to the 2017 EC shopping fine. We \nended the quarter with $93 billion in cash and marketable securities. Now turning to segment results. Google Services revenue increased 13% to $76.5 billion. \nGoogle Search and other advertising revenue increased by 12% to $49.4 billion. The robust performance of search was broad-based across verticals, led by the \nfinancial services vertical due to strength in insurance followed by retail. YouTube advertising revenue increased 12% to $8.9 billion, driven by brand, followed by \ndirect response advertising. As Philipp mentioned, we're seeing strong momentum in YouTube, including robust growth in watch time across the platform and are \nexcited about the new features and products we're bringing to creators. Network advertising revenue of $7.5 billion were down 2%. In the third quarter, the \nyear-on-year growth in all our advertising revenue lines was impacted by the increase in strength in advertising revenue in Q3 of last year, in part from \nAPAC-based retailers. Subscription platforms and devices revenue increased 28% to $10.7 billion, reflecting growth in subscription revenues, as well as the \nlaunch of our Made by Google devices in the third quarter. We continue to have significant growth in our subscription products, driven primarily by YouTube TV \nand YouTube Music Premium, as well as Google One, primarily due to increases in the number of paid subscribers. With regards to platforms, we're pleased with \nthe performance in play, primarily driven by an increase in buyers. Google Service operating income increased by 29% to $30.9 billion, and operating margin was \n40%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, which continued to deliver very strong results this quarter. Revenue increased by 35% to $11.4 billion in the third \nquarter, reflecting accelerated growth in GCP across AI infrastructure, generative AI solutions and core GCP products. Once again, GCP grew at a rate that was \nhigher than cloud overall. We also saw strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. As you just heard from \nSundar, the robust innovation and expanded AI offerings within our cloud business are allowing existing and new customers to realize measurable business \nbenefits, including reduced cost, greater customer engagement, faster response time and better revenue conversion. Google Cloud operating income increased \nto $1.9 billion and operating margin increased to 17%. The operating margin expansion was driven by strong revenue performance across cloud AI products, core \nGCP and Workspace, as well as ongoing efficiency initiatives. As to our Other Bets, for the third quarter revenue were $388 million and operating loss was $1.1 \nbillion. I'll highlight just a couple of accomplishments in the quarter for Waymo and Wing. We're excited about the progress we're seeing in Waymo, as Sundar \nmentioned, and the increase in the number of paid rides. We're planning to continue to expand our geographic coverage and reach more customers in existing \nmarkets and new markets. Wing, our drone delivery company, recently passed the 1-year anniversary of scaling its partnership with Walmart in the Dallas-Fort \nWorth area, now operating in 11 stores and serving 26 different cities and towns. Turning to Alphabet level activities. The largest component of this line is our \ninvestment in AI research and development activities, which support all of Alphabet. There were two notable items that impacted the operating loss in Alphabet \nlevel activities. First, a $607 million charge related to decisions we've made to further optimize our physical footprint and office space globally; and second, our \nongoing investments in AI R&D, including the full quarter effect of the organizational changes we've made in May to move some additional AI teams from Google \nServices to Google DeepMind. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the third quarter was $13 billion, reflecting investment in our technical infrastructure \nwith the largest component being investment in servers, followed by data centers and networking equipment. Looking ahead, we expect quarterly CapEx in the \nfourth quarter to be at similar levels to Q3, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx. Our expansion of \ndata center capacity is expected to bring economic benefits to countries and communities where we are investing. In the third quarter alone, we made \nannouncements of over $7 billion in planned data center investments with nearly $6 billion of that in the U.S. In Q3, we also returned value to shareholders in the \nform of $15.3 billion in share repurchases and $2.5 billion in dividend payments. Overall, we returned a total of nearly $70 billion over the trailing 12 months to \nshareholders. As we look forward, we're working to balance our investments in AI and other growth areas with the cost discipline needed to fund those activities. \nAs we think about the remainder of 2024, there are a couple of dynamics to consider. In terms of revenue, year-on-year growth in advertising revenue will \ncontinue to be impacted by the increasing strength in advertising revenue in the second half of 2023, in part from APAC-based retailers. And there will be a \nheadwind to year-over-year growth in subscription platforms and devices revenue in the fourth quarter due to the pull forward of our Made by Google launches \ninto the third quarter this year. In terms of expenses, we'll continue to see increases in depreciation and expenses associated with higher level of investment in \nour technical infrastructure, partially offset by a slight benefit from the cost revenue associated with our devices due to the pull forward of hardware launches into \nQ3. Now before going into Q&A, as the new CFO, I would like to share a few thoughts on how I'm approaching and thinking through growth, cost structure and \ncapital allocation and expect to hear more from me on these topics in the coming quarters. As I look at the business, I see opportunities for further growth \npropelled by AI and the underlying momentum across the business. You heard about some of these on the call today. I also believe that we are well positioned to\n\ndeliver meaningful innovation, which will translate to revenue given our strength in the core pillars that are required to succeed in AI at scale. Realizing those\nopportunities and great innovation in AI requires global reach, which we have through our products and platforms, as well as continued meaningful capital\ninvestment. And while we have a strong balance sheet to be able to support these investments, we will be looking for efficiencies so that we can fund innovation\nin priority areas. Sundar, Ruth and our leadership team started important work to reengineer our cost structure including efforts such as optimizing our headcount\ngrowth, our physical footprint, improving the efficiencies of our technical infrastructure and streamlining operations across the company through the use of AI. I\nplan to build on these efforts, but also evaluate where we might be able to accelerate work and where we might need to pivot to free up capital for more attractive\nopportunities. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions.\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

Great question. Look, it's been an extraordinary year of innovation. I mentioned in my remarks about Circle to Search Lens now with video search\napproaching over 20 billion queries a month and obviously, AI Overviews. And with each of these changes, we are definitely expanding what's possible in search.\nAnd it's been really heartening to see users adapt. They understand they can ask more queries. They come back more often. And so - and we have seen growth\nthere. I think we are with very - while we've rolled out AI Overviews to over 1 billion users, there is a lot more innovation there we are actively working on. So I\nexpect search to continue to evolve significantly in 2025, both in the search product and in Gemini. And so I think that's the opportunity ahead. I think we are in\nearly days of what is a powerful new technology. And with it, I think we can do a lot more for our users, but at the same time, underpin it on the foundational\nbedrock of quality and trust and user experience, which we have always done. So we are at 1 billion people. I don't necessarily see a constraint there. Obviously,\nthings like latency, cost per query, et cetera. But as you've seen us over the past 18 months make substantial progress. So we'll continue rolling it out more, and\nwe'll keep evolving it.

We are working on the third generation, which is progressing well. And teams internally are now set up much better to consume the\nunderlying model innovation and translate that into innovation within their products. So now all the seven products, which have 2 billion users each have done\ntheir first versions of incorporating Gemini, and there is aggressive road map ahead for 2025. I mentioned earlier, search alone. I think there's a lot more we can\ndo.

And then secondly, just across the board, when you think about the business that's running at, what, 32% operating margins this last quarter, and you\ncome in looking at this fresh, is it clear to you that there are a lot of kind of newfound cost efficiencies or ongoing cost efficiencies?

Let me start on the cloud margin. So certainly, very pleased to see not just the top line growth rate, but the margin \nexpansion to 17%, really outstanding work by our cloud team to drive continued benefit to customers. And as you think about that margin expansion, really, it's a \nfew things. You've mentioned one of them. The first is scale. Obviously, as we scale the business, we have more opportunity for margin expansion. But the \nsecond, and shouldn't be underestimated is the work the team has done to drive efficiencies across the cloud business, and we're seeing those come through, \nwhether it's through headcount management or facilities management, other process efficiencies. We're seeing that go to the bottom line and driving the results\n\nyou're seeing this quarter. Hard to obviously compare to any of our peers or competitors. It's a different business, but more to come. Now the one thing to\nremember, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, this is an area that requires investment. And a lot of these investments, you think about servers, et\ncetera, is based on demand we're seeing from customers. So this will translate to revenue in the fairly short term. But that means there are headwinds associated\nwith the - overall, the annual run rate or costs associated with these investments, whether it's in the form of depreciation or just construction costs that are not\ncapitalized, et cetera. So we'll continue to drive efficiency in the business to try and offset some of these. But this is how I'm thinking about the dynamics for cloud.\nOverall, for the business, this is one of my key priorities is to look across the organization to see what we can do in terms of driving further efficiencies. There's\nreally good work that was done started by Ruth, Sundar and the rest of the lead team to reengineer the cost base. But I think any organization can always push a\nlittle further. And I'll be looking at additional opportunities really across all the elements that I've mentioned in my prepared remarks, think not just about the size of\nthe organization, but mostly how we operate and how we run the business. And I think when you simplify the organization, Sundar just made a few comments on\nthat. When we use AI within our own processes and how we get work done, there are some efficiencies or opportunities for efficiencies. Now all of that will go\nagainst substantial increases in capital investment, as I've mentioned, going into 2025. And again, I'll give more color when we are on the Q4 call.
