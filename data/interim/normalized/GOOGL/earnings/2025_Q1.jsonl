Good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our strong results this quarter. We continue to see healthy growth and momentum across the \nbusiness, including AI powering new features. In Search, we saw continued double-digit revenue growth. AI Overviews is going very well with over 1.5 billion \nusers per month, and we are excited by the early positive reaction to AI mode. There's a lot more to come ahead. In Subscriptions, we surpassed 270 million paid \nsubscriptions with YouTube and Google One as key drivers. And Cloud grew rapidly with significant demand for our solutions, and you saw our leadership in AI at \nCloud Next across infrastructure, agents and more. Our differentiated full stack approach to AI continues to be central to our growth. This quarter was super \nexciting as we rolled out Gemini 2.5, our most intelligent AI model, which is achieving breakthroughs in performance and it's widely recognized as the best model \nin the industry. That's an extraordinary foundation for our future innovation, and we are focused on bringing this to people and customers everywhere. Looking \nahead to I/O, Brandcast and Google Marketing Live, I can't wait for our teams to showcase the innovations they've been working on. Turning to our AI progress \nthis quarter, which continues to enable significant growth opportunities. The elements of the AI stack I've previously mentioned are AI Infrastructure, World Class \nResearch including models and tooling and our Products and Platforms. Starting with AI Infrastructure, our long-term investments in our global network have \npositioned us well. Google's network is robust and resilient supported by over 2 million miles of fiber and 33 subsea cables. Complementing this, we offer the \nindustry's widest range of TPUs and GPUs and continue to invest in next-generation capabilities. Ironwood, our seventh-generation TPU and most powerful \nto-date, is the first designed specifically for inference at scale. It delivers more than 10x improvement in compute power or a recent high performance TPU while \nbeing nearly twice as power efficient. Our strong relationship with NVIDIA continues to be a key advantage for us and our customers. We were the first cloud \nprovider to offer NVIDIA's groundbreaking B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs and will be offering their next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs. Second, this \ninfrastructure powers our World Class Research, including our industry leading models. We released Gemini 2.5 Pro last month, receiving extremely positive \nfeedback from both developers and consumers. 2.5 Pro is state-of-the-art on a wide range of benchmarks and debuted at number one on the chatbot arena by a \nsignificant margin. 2.5 Pro achieved big leaps in reasoning, coding, science and math capabilities, opening up new possibilities for developers and customers. \nActive users in AI Studio and Gemini API have grown over 200% since the beginning of the year. And last week, we introduced 2.5 Flash, which enables \ndevelopers to optimize quality and cost. Our latest image and video generation models, Imagen 3 and Veo 2 are rolling out broadly and are powering incredible \ncreativity. Turning to Open Models, we launched Gemma 3 last month delivering state-of-the-art performance for its size. Gemma models have been downloaded \nmore than 140 million times. Lastly, we are developing AI models in new areas where there's enormous opportunity. For example, our new Gemini Robotics \nModels. And in health, we launched AI Co-Scientist, a multi-agent AI research system, while AlphaFold has now been used by over 2.5 million researchers. Third, \nturning to Products and Platforms. All 15 of our products with a 0.5 billion users now use Gemini models. Android and Pixel are two examples of how we are \nputting the best AI in people's hands, making it super easy to use AI for a wide range of tasks just by using their camera, voice or taking a screenshot. We are \nupgrading Google Assistant on mobile devices to Gemini and later this year we'll upgrade tablets, cars and devices that connect to your phone such as \nheadphones and watches. The Pixel 9a launched a very strong reviews, providing the best of Google's AI offerings like Gemini Live and AI powered camera \nfeatures. And Gemini Live camera and screen sharing is now rolling out to all Android devices including Pixel and Samsung S25. Now moving on to key highlights \nfrom across Search, Cloud, YouTube and Waymo. First, Search. AI is one of the most revolutionary technologies for enabling and expanding our information \nmission. And for Search, we see it growing the number and types of questions we can answer. We are already seeing this with AI Overviews, which now has \nmore than 1.5 billion users every month. Nearly a year after we launched AI Overviews in the US, we continue to see that usage growth is increasing as people \nlearn that Search is more useful for more of their queries. So we are leaning in heavily here, continuing to roll the feature out to new countries to more users and \nto more queries. Building on the positive feedback for AI Overviews, in March we released AI Mode, an experiment in labs. It expands what AI Overviews can do \nwith more advanced reasoning, thinking, and multimodal capabilities to help with questions that need further exploration and comparisons. On average, AI Mode \nqueries are twice as long as traditional Search queries. We're getting really positive feedback from early users about its design, fast response time, and ability to \nunderstand complex nuanced questions. We also continue to see significant growth in multimodal queries. Circle to Search is now available on more than 250 \nmillion devices with usage increasing nearly 40% this quarter and monthly visual searches with Lens have increased by 5 billion since October. Moving on to \nCloud. At Cloud Next, we announced major innovations and over 500 companies shared the business results they are achieving by working with us. We provide \nleading cost performance and reliability for AI training and inference. This enables us to deliver the best value for AI leaders like any scale and contextual AI as \nwell as global brands like Verizon. And for highly sensitive data and regulatory requirements, Google distributed Cloud and our Sovereign AI make Gemini \navailable on premises or in country. Our Vertex AI Platform makes over 200 foundation models available, helping customers like Lowe's integrate AI. We offer \nindustry leading models including Gemini 2.5 Pro, 2.5 Flash, Imagen 3, Veo 2, Chirp and Lyria, plus Open Source and third-party models like Llama 4 and \nAnthropic. We are the leading Cloud Solution for companies looking to the new era of AI agents, a big opportunity. Our Agent Development Kit is a new Open \nSource Framework to simplify the process of building sophisticated AI agents and multi-agent systems. And Agent Designer is a low code tool to build AI agents \nand automate tasks in over 100 enterprise applications and systems. We are putting AI agents in the hands of employees at major global companies like KPMG.", "char_count": 7094, "word_count": 1146, "token_count": 1455, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "GOOGL_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q1_u_0001", "company": "GOOGL", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2025, "period": "2025-Q1", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/GOOGL/GOOGL_FY2025_Q1.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

It combines Enterprise Search, Conversational AI or Chat and access to Gemini and third-party Agents. We also offer prepackaged\n\nagents across customer engagement, coding, creativity and more that are helping to provide conversational customer experiences, accelerate software\ndevelopment and improve decision making. And of course, Google Workspace, it delivers more than 2 billion AI assists monthly including summarizing Gmail and\nrefining Docs. Lastly, our cybersecurity products are helping organizations detect, investigate and respond to cybersecurity threats. Our expertise coupled with\nintegrated Gemini AI advances, detects malware, prioritizes threats, and speeds up investigative workflows. This quarter, we were excited to announce our intent\nto acquire Wiz, a leading cloud security platform that protects all major clouds and code environments. Together, we can make it easier and faster for\norganizations of all types and sizes to protect themselves, end-to-end and across all major clouds. We think this will help spur more multi-cloud computing,\nsomething customers want. Next, YouTube. Yesterday marked a historic milestone. The 20th anniversary of the first video uploaded to YouTube. From that\nsingle, 19-second upload, the platform has grown into a global phenomenon, fundamentally changing how billions of people create, share, and experience\ncontent. Through all this growth, subscriptions are now a big part of the business. We continue to diversify subscription options, recently expanding our Premium\nLite pilot to the US, giving users a new way to enjoy most videos on YouTube ad-free. TV is the primary device for YouTube viewing in the US. According to\nNielsen, YouTube has been number one in streaming watch time in the US for the last two years. And YouTube now has over 1 billion monthly active podcast\nusers. YouTube Music and Premium reached over 125 million subscribers, including trials, globally. And finally, Waymo is now safely serving over a quarter of a\nmillion paid passenger trips each week. That's up 5x from a year ago. This past quarter, Waymo opened up paid service in Silicon Valley. Through our\npartnership with Uber, we expanded in Austin and are preparing for our public launch in Atlanta later this summer. We recently announced Washington, DC, as a\nfuture ride-hailing city, going live in 2026 alongside Miami. Waymo continues progressing on two important capabilities for riders, airport access and freeway\ndriving. Thanks to all of our employees for their work this quarter. It was a great start to the year and Q2 will be even more exciting.

I'll quickly cover performance for the quarter and then frame the rest of my remarks around the progress we're delivering\nacross Search, Ads, YouTube and partnerships. Google services revenues were $77 billion for the quarter, up 10% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in\nSearch and YouTube, partially offset by year-on-year decline in network revenues. To add some further color to the performance, the 10% increase in Search and\nother revenues was led by financial services, primarily due to strength in insurance, followed by retail. YouTube saw a similar performance across verticals. Its\n10% growth in advertising revenues was driven by Direct Response followed by Brand. So let's start with Search, where we've seen robust growth in revenues.\nAll around the world, over 2 billion people use Search every day to find information, compare products, or shop. And there are more than 5 trillion searches on\nGoogle annually. We've continued our efforts to help more people ask entirely new questions, bringing more opportunities for businesses to connect with\nconsumers. And as we've mentioned before, with the launch of AI Overviews, the volume of commercial queries has increased. Q1 marked our largest expansion\nto-date for AI Overviews, both in terms of launching to new users and providing responses for more questions. The feature is now available in more than 15\nlanguages across 140 countries. For AI Overviews overall, we continue to see monetization at approximately the same rate, which gives us a strong base on\nwhich we can innovate even more. Turning to Visual Queries. On the last earnings call, I mentioned the success we're seeing with Lens, where shoppers use\ntheir camera or images to quickly find information in ways they couldn't before. In Q1, the number of people shopping on Lens grew by over 10% and the majority\nof Lens queries are incremental. Sundar mentioned the significant growth we're also seeing with Circle to Search as multimodality continues to drive queries\nacross Search. Moving to Ads. More businesses, big and small, are adopting AI powered campaigns. And the deployment of AI across our Ads business is\ndriving results for our customers and for our business. Throughout 2024, we launched several features that leverage LLMs to enhance advertiser value, and we're\nseeing this work pay off. The combination of these launches now allows us to match Ads to more relevant Search queries, and this helps advertisers reach\ncustomers in searches where we would not previously have shown their Ads. Focusing on our customers, we continue to solve advertisers' pain points and find\nopportunities to help them create, distribute, and measure more performant Ads, infusing AI at every step of the marketing process. On Audience Insights, we\nreleased new asset audience recommendations, which tell businesses the themes that resonate most with their top audiences. On Creators, advertisers can now\ngenerate a broader variety of lifestyle imagery customized to their business to better engage their customers and use them across PMax, Demand Gen, Display,\nand App campaigns. Additionally, in PMax, advertisers can automatically source images from their landing pages and crop them, increasing the variety of their\nassets. On Media Buying, advertisers continue to see how AI powered campaigns help them find new customers. In Demand Gen, advertisers can more precisely\nmanage ad placements across YouTube, Gmail, Discover, and Google Display Network globally and understand which assets work best at a channel level.\nThanks to dozens of AI part improvements launched in 2024, businesses using Demand Gen now see an average 26% year-on-year increase in conversions per\ndollar spent for goals like purchases and leads. And when using Demand Gen with product feed, on average, they see more than double the conversion per dollar\nspent year-over-year. As an example, Royal Canin combined Demand Gen and PMax campaigns to find more customers for its cat and dog food products. The\nintegration resulted in a 2.7 times higher conversion rate, a 70% lower cost per acquisition for purchases, and increased the value per user by 8%. Turning to\nYouTube, where we saw strong growth in revenues across Ads and subscriptions. This week, we're celebrating YouTube's 20th anniversary. We're proud of its\nleadership as a streaming destination where people come to watch everything they love, from live sports and creator produced content to shorts and podcasts.\nCreators are what drives viewership, and on average, they upload 20 million videos a day to YouTube. Our biggest creators generate a level of fandom and\nviewer engagement around large cultural moments on YouTube that brands can't find anywhere else. During March Madness, brands aligned not only with clips\nand highlights from the game, but also with the creators who drive basketball culture, like Jesser and The Ringer's J. Kyle Mann. In Q1, the growth of our\nreservation based Ads business more than doubled year-over-year. Brands and creators continue to use the opportunities that collaborations and partnerships\noffer. Toyota worked with Zach King, the king of short magical videos with over 42 million followers to take over his channel. The creator takeover and\naccompanying creator ad lifted Toyota's brand awareness by 25% compared to Control Group. And 9% compared to the Toyota brand ad. Looking at shorts,\nengaged views grew by over 20% in the first quarter. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making globally in shorts monetization relative to\nin-stream viewing and are particularly encouraged by the trend in the US. As always, I'll wrap up with a strong momentum we're seeing in partnerships where our\ncustomers increasingly recognize the strength and breadth of what Google has to offer. For instance, Roblox is partnering Google Ad Manager to bring immersive\nAds to gamers. Gen Z gamers are Roblox's biggest users, and thanks to our partnership, advertisers will be able to reach this audience with Ads that blend\nseamlessly into the gaming experience. We also launched a YouTube shorts effect to help people release iconic Roblox heads and inspire fans to create content\nat scale. In closing, I'd like to thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions and commitment to our success and to our customers and partners for their\ncontinued trust.

My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter unless they state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet \nlevel and will then cover our segment results. I'll end with some commentary on our outlook for the second quarter and 2025. We had another strong quarter in \nQ1, Consolidated revenues of $90.2 billion increased by 12% or 14% in constant currency. Search and YouTube advertising, subscription platforms and devices, \nand Google Cloud, each had double-digit revenue growth this quarter reflecting strong momentum across the business. Total cost of revenue was $36.4 billion up \n8%. TAC was $13.7 billion up 6%. We continue to see a revenue mix shift with Google Search growth at double-digit levels, while network revenues, which have \nmuch higher TAC rate, declined. Other costs of revenue was $22.6 billion up 9%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition costs largely for\n\nYouTube, followed by depreciation other technical infrastructure operations costs. Total operating expenses increased 9% to $23.3 billion. R&D investments\nincreased by 14%, primarily driven by increases in compensation, and depreciation expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased 4%, primarily reflecting\na decline in compensation expenses. G&A expenses increased by 17% reflecting the impact of charges for legal and other matters. Operating income increased\n20% this quarter to $31 billion and operating margin increased to 33.9% representing 2.3 points of margin expansion. Operating margin benefited from healthy\nrevenue growth a moderated pace of compensation growth, and a favorable mix shift towards lower TAC advertising revenues, partially offset by a year-on-year\nincrease in depreciation expenses of just over $1 billion. Other income and expenses was $11.2 billion primarily due to unrealized gain on our non-marketable\nequity securities related to our investment in a private company, which we noted in our 10-K as a subsequent event. Net income increased 46% to $34.5 billion\nand earnings per share increased 49% to $2.81. We delivered free cash flow of $19 billion in the first quarter and $74.9 billion for the trailing 12 months. We\nended the quarter with $95 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Google services revenues increased 10% to $77.3 billion\nreflecting strength in Google Search and YouTube advertising as subscription. Google Search and other advertising revenues increased by 10% to $50.7 billion.\nThe robust performance of Search was once again broad-based across verticals led by financial services due primarily to strength in insurance, followed by retail.\nYouTube advertising revenues increased 10% to $8.9 billion driven by Direct Response advertising followed by Brand. Network advertising of $7.3 billion were\ndown 2%. Subscription platforms and device revenues increased 19% to $10.4 billion primarily reflecting growth in subscription revenues. This growth was\nprimarily driven by YouTube subscription offerings followed by Google One, with growth in the number of subscribers being the biggest driver of revenue growth.\nGoogle services operating income increased 17% to $32.7 billion and operating margin increased from 39.6% to 42.3%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment,\nwhich continued to deliver very strong results this quarter. Revenue increased by 28% to $12.3 billion in the first quarter, reflecting growth in GCP across core\nand AI products at a rate that was much higher than Cloud's overall revenue growth rate. Growth in Google Workspace was primarily driven by an increase in\naverage revenue per seat. Google Cloud operating income increased to $2.2 billion and operating margin increased from 9.4% to 17.8%. As we scale our fleet,\nwe continue to focus on driving improvements in productivity, efficiency, and utilization to offset the growth in expenses particularly from higher depreciation.

With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the first\nquarter was $17.2 billion primarily reflecting investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component being investment in servers, followed by data\ncenters to support the growth of our business across Google Services, Google Cloud, and Google DeepMind. In Q1, we returned value to shareholders, in the\nform of $15.1 billion in share repurchases and $2.4 billion in dividend payments. As we announced today, our Board of Directors declared a 5% increase in our\nquarterly dividend and also approved and used $70 billion share repurchase authorization. Turning to our Outlook. I would like to provide some commentary on\nseveral factors that will impact our business performance in the second quarter and the remainder of 2025. First, in terms of revenue, I'll highlight a couple of\nitems that we mentioned last quarter that will have an impact on second quarter and 2025 revenue. First, in Google Services, advertising revenue in 2025 will be\nimpacted by lapping the strength we experience in the financial service vertical throughout 2024. Second in Cloud, we're in a tight demand supply environment\nand given that revenues are correlated with the timing of deployment of new capacity, we could see variability in cloud revenue growth rates depending on\ncapacity deployment each quarter. We expect relatively higher capacity deployment towards the end of 2025. Moving to investments, starting with our expectation\nfor CapEx for the full year 2025. We still expect to invest approximately $75 billion in CapEx this year. The expected CapEx investment level may fluctuate from\nquarter-to-quarter, due to the impact of changes in the timing of deliveries and construction schedules. In terms of expenses, first, as I mentioned on our previous\nearnings call, the significant increase in our investments in CapEx over the past few years will continue to put pressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of higher\ndepreciation. In the first quarter, we saw 31% year-on-year growth in depreciation from the increase in technical infrastructure assets placed in service. Given the\nincrease in CapEx investments over the past few years, we expect the growth rate in depreciation to accelerate throughout 2025. Second, as we've previously\nsaid, we expect some headcount growth in 2025 in key investment area. As we've disclosed previously, due to a shift in the timing of our annual employee\nstock-based compensation award beginning in 2023, our first quarter stock-based comp expenses is relatively lower compared to the remaining quarters of the\nyear. In conclusion, as you heard from Sundar and Philip, we're pleased with the progress we're making across the organization. The results for the quarter and\nthe opportunities ahead. Our success as a company is grounded in our experience driving advancements in deep computer science that enables us to create\ninnovative new products and services for users, businesses, and partners around the world. We have a strong track record of incubating and then building these\nofferings into new profitable businesses for Alphabet. As we announced last quarter, YouTube and Cloud exited 2024 at a combined annual run rate of $110\nbillion. And as you heard from Sundar earlier, Waymo is continuing to progress in building on its impressive technological achievements to scale rapidly and\ndevelop a sustainable business model. Thank you. Sundar, Philip, and I will now take your questions.\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.

We are deploying it across all parts of the company. Our customer service teams are deeply leading the way there. We've both dramatically\nenhanced our user experience as well as made it much more efficient to do so.

So on your first question on profitability and what levers do we have and do we still have levers to pull first, I think, every organization can always push a\nlittle further. I don't view productivity goals or efficiency as an episodic kind of project-based effort, but rather a continuous effort that when you get to a certain\nplace, you push a little further. Having said that, we do have significant investments we're making across the organization and we have been making them for the\npast several quarters. And we've been able to do it because we were able to find efficiency to fund those investments across the organization. Those are for\nproducts and services that are going to drive long-term growth for the company. So while we're trying to offset as much of the headwind associated with the\nincrease in infrastructure costs, it will become more difficult. As I said, the depreciation will accelerate. We had about a 31% year-over-year growth in depreciation\nthis quarter and it will be higher as we go throughout the year. So think about that kind of as a headwind that we have to manage against. But we're continuing\nwith, pushing across the organization leveraging, Sundar mentioned, the use of AI and kind of an AI-first Google across several of our functions to help us\nmanage a larger scope of work using our AI, AI agents, and AI tools. As Sundar mentioned, we did leverage it in preparation for the earnings call and we're\nleveraging across several functions. So there are opportunities, but there are also great opportunities for investment and we want to make sure that we make\nroom for, to make these investments to drive long-term growth and ensure we have a very resilient long-term growth profile for the company.", "char_count": 1745, "word_count": 299, "token_count": 360, "exchange_id": null, "exchange_role": null, "chunk_id": "GOOGL_TRANSCRIPT_2025_Q1_u_0022", "company": "GOOGL", "doc_type": "earnings_transcript", "fiscal_year": 2025, "period": "2025-Q1", "source_file": "data/earnings_calls_manual/GOOGL/GOOGL_FY2025_Q1.pdf", "parsed_at": "2025-11-09T21:07:08Z", "section_id": null, "section_title": null}

Within Search we think of AI Overviews\nscaling up and working for our entire user base, but an AI Mode is the tip of the tree for us pushing forward on an AI forward experience. There will be things\nwhich we discover there which will make sense in the context of AI Overviews. So I think will flow through to our user base.

And I've mentioned this in the prepared remarks, you've seen improvement in TAC\nthat's really driven by the change in revenue mix with a continued Search, growth and then network revenue declines. Network revenue has a much higher TAC\nrate. So that mix is helping us from a gross margin perspective. So think about that as well. Now we do have depreciation for technical infrastructure hits in two\nplaces primarily in two places in the income statement. One is in other cost of sales and the rest is in R&D. So it is in that line item that's impacting cost of sales.\nNow we've had some efficiencies there and I did mention the improvement in our overall cost of headcount growth and compensation kind of moderating those\ngrowth. So that helps us as well more than offset the depreciation increases in Q1. But as I mentioned this number will be higher in the coming quarters. Recall,\nwe have we set approximately $75 billion in CapEx, which is up from $55 billion or just over $50 billion last year.
