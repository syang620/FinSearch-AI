## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Brian Nowak (Morgan Stanley)**: Thanks for taking my questions. I have a two-parter, Sundar. The first one, over the course of the last year plus, you've sort of showcased a lot of different types
of new GenAI enabled search products to sort of reimagine the search experience. Can you help us hone in on one or two 0these products that you're most
excited about that you think over the next 2 to 3 years could really lead to more durable multiyear search growth once they scale? And then the second one, just
as we're sort of thinking through constraints to how quickly they come out, what are sort of the key constraints that you see to really reimagining search and
scaling it out across 2 billion to 3 billion people? Thanks.

### Exchange 002

**Doug Anmuth (JPMorgan)**: All right. Thanks for taking the question. Perhaps for Sundar and Anat. Can you talk more about the infrastructure advantages and CapEx efficiencies you've
generated from Google's own TPUs? And how does that influence your CapEx spending going forward relative to peers and other leading cloud service
providers? Thanks.

### Exchange 003

Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.

### Exchange 004

**Eric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs)**: Thank you for taking the question. And Anat congrats on the new role. And welcome to Alphabet. Sundar, maybe one for you on Waymo. What are the key
learnings as Waymo has rolled out to additional cities in terms of consumer adoption of the product and how you think about go-to-market strategies for Waymo?
And then maybe one for Philipp. In terms of looking at YouTube trends by long-form versus short-form video or shorts, how are you seeing consumption versus
monetization trends continue to evolve for YouTube as broken down maybe in that means? Thank you.

### Exchange 005

**Ross Sandler (Barclays)**: Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats, Anat. Two, if that's okay. So first, Sundar, given the high stakes around native AI product usage, are
there any milestones you can share around where Gemini usage is compared to the 250 million weekly active users that ChatGPT is seeing right now? And then
the second question is, I'm sure this is something you guys have been thinking about for a while, but it looks like the way that the Google versus DOJ search trial
is going, there's a decent likelihood that the Apple ISA contract and some of the Android pre-install contracts are going to be voided out at some point in the
future. So I guess the question is, what plans do we have in place to recapture some of the usage that might be going away in those search access points? How
can we gain share on iOS queries if the Safari toolbar access point were to change? Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from Justin Post with BAML. Your line is now open.

### Exchange 007

**Mark Mahaney (Evercore)**: Okay. I'd like to ask two questions, please, to Anat. First, the margins at cloud have really started to ramp nicely. There are comps in the industry with still
materially higher operating margins. I imagine that's a matter of scale and trying to catch up from a third place position. But how do you think about the margin
trends that you're seeing? And what's your level of confidence that those margins can kind of match up to other industry players that are doing closer to 30%
margins? And then secondly, just across the board, when you think about the business that's running at, what, 32% operating margins this last quarter, and you
come in looking at this fresh, is it clear to you that there are a lot of kind of newfound cost efficiencies or ongoing cost efficiencies? Like what do you see as the
biggest opportunities to kind of take those margins and maybe over time, take them materially higher? Thank you very much.

### Exchange 008

**Mark Mahaney (Evercore)**: Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.

### Exchange 009

**Ken Gawrelski (Wells Fargo)**: Thank you so much. Two, if I may. First, just on search, why does it make sense to have completely - why doesn't it make sense to have two completely different
search experiences. One, an agent-like answers engine, and then two, a links-based more traditional search engine. You could innovate on both and let the
consumer decide. It's - maybe think of it as the ultimate A/B test. So I'd be curious to get your thoughts there. And then the second, if you could touch a little bit on
the consumer environment in 4Q. Perhaps nobody has a better view into the health of the consumer in multiple verticals. If you could talk a little bit about - you
talked about tougher comps on the Asia e-commerce side, but any other trends you could point out be around the election or fewer holiday days this year, that
would be really helpful. Thank you.

### Exchange 010

**Stephen Ju (UBS)**: Thank you so much. Hi, Sundar. I think in two separate blog posts from Google Cloud, talking about the real-life use cases for GenAI, I think you highlighted what
was a pretty material increase in a number of companies that are starting to turn their, I guess, ideas into products. I think it was like an 80% increase in the
6-month period. And I think you guys also published some survey data saying that your customers are generating tangible ROI there. So can you update us on
what you're seeing in terms of sales cycles, perhaps accelerating? And how much of the heavy lifting the cloud team may have to do to help your customers turn
those ideas into reality more quickly? And Philipp, I think one of the feedbacks that we're getting from advertisers is that while the initial use case for PMax for
them was in search, they're starting to use it more and more for mid and upper funnel campaigns and budgets as well. So can you talk about whether that's an
anecdote or something that you're already seeing perpetuate among all of your advertisers? Thank you.

Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.
