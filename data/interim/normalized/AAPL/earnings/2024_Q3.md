### Tim Cook (CFO)

Thank you Suhasini. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% 
from a year ago and better than we had expected. EPS grew double digits to $1.40 and achieved a record for the June quarter. We also set quarterly revenue 
records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, the UK, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. And 
we set an all-time revenue record in services which grew 14%. At our Worldwide Developers Conference, we were thrilled to unveil game-changing updates 
across our platforms, including Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovation and investment in AI and Machine Learning. It will transform 
how users interact with technology, from writing tools to help you express yourself, to image playground, which gives you the ability to create fun images and 
communicate in new ways, to powerful tools for summarizing and prioritizing notifications. Siri also becomes more natural, more useful, and more personal than 
ever. Apple Intelligence is built on a foundation of privacy, both through on-device processing that does not collect users' data and through private cloud compute, 
a groundbreaking new approach to using the cloud, while protecting users' information powered by Apple silicon. We are also integrating ChatGPT into 
experiences within iPhone, Mac, and iPad, enabling users to draw on a broad base of world knowledge. We are very excited about Apple Intelligence and we 
remain incredibly optimistic about the extraordinary possibilities of AI and its ability to enrich customers' lives. We will continue to make significant investments in 
this technology and dedicate ourselves to the innovation that will unlock its full potential. Recently, we've also been excited to bring Apple Vision Pro to more 
countries, giving customers the chance to discover the remarkable capabilities of this magical device. Vision Pro users are customizing their own workspaces, 
watching movies on 100-foot screens, and exploring entire worlds with just a pinch of their fingertips. With more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million 
compatible apps for Vision OS, the developer community continues to pioneer stunning spatial experiences that are only possible with Vision Pro. Last month, we 
announced that we're bringing some amazing new immersive content to Vision Pro, including new series, concerts, films, and more. And we've seen great 
interest for Vision Pro in the enterprise, where it can empower companies large and small to pursue their best ideas like never before. With each innovation, we're 
unlocking new ways of working, new ways of learning, and new ways of tapping into the unlimited promise of human potential. We are doing that across every 
product and every service. Now let me share more detail in our June quarter results, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% 
year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we grew compared to last year. Customers continue to praise the iPhone 15 lineup for its incredible battery life, 
exceptional cameras, and unmatched power and performance. And we are excited to bring incredible new features to the iPhone with iOS 18, making it more 
personal, capable, and intelligent than ever before. This update includes the biggest redesign of the Photos app, new customization options for the home screen, 
messages over satellite, and the introduction of Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence utilizes the power of our most advanced iPhones, the iPhone 15 Pro and

### Pro Max (Unknown)

inch MacBook Air. With back-to-school season upon us, MacBook Air is the perfect companion for students on campus and small business owners, developers, 
and creatives of all kinds depend on Mac to do more than they ever could before. Powered by Apple silicon with its neural engine and privacy built in at the chip 
level, Macs are simply the best personal computers for AI. And every Mac we've shipped with Apple silicon since 2020, is capable of taking advantage of Apple 
Intelligence with Mac OS Sequoia. We also know the importance of security for our users and enterprises so we continue to advance protections across our 
products. Turning to iPad, revenue was $7.2 billion, 24% higher year-over-year. During the quarter, we had an incredible launch where we unveiled the all-new 11 
and 13 inch iPad Air, the perfect device for education, entertainment, and so much more. And With the new iPad Pro, we pushed the boundaries of 
power-efficient performance with the remarkable M4 chip, the engine behind this incredibly thin device. By leveraging the latest in Apple silicon, Video Editors and 
Musicians can take advantage of the cutting edge AI features in Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro. And we're very excited that iPad Pro and iPad Air models powered 
by the M series of Apple silicon will be able to utilize the powerful capabilities of Apple Intelligence. In wearables, home, and accessories, revenue was $8.1 
billion, down 2% from a year ago. Apple Watch is empowering users to live a healthier day with a range of tools to take charge of their wellness journeys. At the 
core of Apple Watch, are powerful AI features that are helping users get help when they need it most, from irregular heart rhythm notifications to walking 
steadiness to crash detection and fall detection. I've heard time and again how meaningful these features are for users and their loved ones, and their stories 
motivate us to keep pushing forward on this vital work. As I mentioned earlier, in services, we set an all-time revenue record of $24.2 billion with paid 
subscriptions climbing to an all-time high. We achieve revenue records in the majority of the services categories with all-time revenue records in advertising, 
cloud, and payment services. Apple TV+ productions are delighting audiences on screens large and small. We're sharing powerful works of imagination with 
series and movies like Presumed Innocent, the Upcoming Disclaimer, and The Instigators starring Matt Damon. And we can't wait for returning fan favorites with 
new seasons of The Morning Show, Slow Horses, and Severance. Apple TV+ productions also continue to earn accolades with nearly 2,300 nominations and 500 
wins to-date. That includes 72 Emmy Award nominations across 16 programs our best ever showing for the upcoming awards event. During the quarter, we also 
expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets including Japan, Canada, Italy, and Germany, enabling more businesses to use the power of iPhone to accept 
contactless payments. And we announced new updates to our services coming this fall, including US national park hikes and custom walk routes and Apple 
Maps, the ability to pay with rewards using Apple Pay, collaborative listening with Apple Music, and a redesigned Apple Fitness+ experience to help users make 
the most of our library of workouts and meditations. Turning to retail, we continue to expand in emerging markets with our first ever location in Malaysia. 
Customers from all over the country came together with our team members to celebrate this special moment. Elsewhere in the world, our teams have been 
sharing the magic of Apple Vision Pro and demos that delight, inspire, and deeply move customers exploring the wonders of spatial computing for the first time. At 
the heart of all of our innovations are the values that guide everything we do. We believe fundamentally that the best technology is technology that works for 
everyone. And in honor of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we introduced all new capabilities to give users more ways to take advantage of all our products

can do. These include eye tracking for users to control iPhone or iPad visually, music haptics to give those who are deaf or hard of hearing a tangible way to
experience music, and vocal shortcuts that tie task to a user's voice. And we are committed as ever to shipping products that offer the highest standards of
privacy for our users. With everything we do, whether it's offering a browser like Safari that prevents third-parties from tracking you across the internet or
providing new features like the ability to lock and hide apps, we are determined to keep our users in control of their own data. And we are just as dedicated to
ensuring the security of our users' data. That's why we work to minimize the amount of data we collect and work to maximize how much is processed directly on
people's devices, a foundational principle that is at the core of all we build, including Apple Intelligence. And we continue to make significant progress on the
environment. We are proud to say that all of our data centers, including those that will run private cloud compute, operate on 100% renewable energy. At Apple,
we're constantly accelerating our pace of innovation. We are a company in relentless pursuit of big ideas. Time and again, we've seen how a spark of creativity
can reach breakthrough velocity, reach across previously unexplored dimensions, and ultimately take flight in ways that can change the world. It's why we're
going to keep investing in the meaningful innovation that enriches the lives of all of our customers. We have a busy time ahead of us, and I couldn't be more
excited for all the amazing things yet to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.

### Luca Maestri (Unknown)

Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year, despite
230 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact. We achieved growth in the vast majority of our markets, with June quarter revenue records in the
Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $61.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Our
installed base of active devices reach an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to our unmatched levels of customer satisfaction and
loyalty and a large number of customers who are new to our products. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with
an all-time record in developed markets and a June quarter record in emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.3% near the high end of our guidance
range and down 30 basis points sequentially driven by a different mix within products which was partially offset by a favorable mix shift towards services and cost
savings. Products gross margin was 35.3%, down 130 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin
was 74% down 60 basis points from last quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided and up 7%
year-over-year. Net income was $21.4 billion, diluted EPS of $1.40 was up 11% year-over-year and set a June quarter record. And operating cash flow was very
strong at $28.9 billion, also a June quarter record. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1%
year-over-year, but grew on a constant currency basis. We set June quarter records across several countries, including the UK, Spain, Poland, Mexico,
Indonesia, and the Philippines. And the iPhone Active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the June
quarter, many iPhone models were among the top selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top selling
model in the US, urban China, the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan. Customer satisfaction on the iPhone 15 family continues to be extremely high, with 451
Research measuring it at 98% in the US in their latest reports. Mac generated $7 billion in revenue, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the MacBook Air powered by
the M3 chip. We saw particularly strong performance in our emerging markets, with June quarter records for Mac in Latin America, India, and South Asia. The
Mac installed base reached an all-time high with half of MacBook Air customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And customer satisfaction for Mac was recently
reported at 96% in the US. iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, up 24% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Customers are loving
the latest iPad lineup for its new design and display, unparalleled performance, AI capabilities and much more. The iPad install base has continued to grow and is
an all-time high, as half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at
97% in the US. Wearables, home and accessories revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year, a sequential acceleration from the March quarter. Watch
and AirPods continue to face a difficult compare against prior year launches of the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. Apple
Watch continues to attract new customers, with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending
the Apple Watch install base to a new all-time high. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicate a customer satisfaction of 97% for watch in the US. In
services, total revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year. We continue to have great momentum in services, as the growth
of our installed base of active devices, sets a strong foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. And we see increased customer engagement with our
services offerings. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reach a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Also, paid
subscriptions showed strong double digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number
that we had only four years ago. And we are constantly focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services. From critically acclaimed new content on
Apple TV+ to new games on Apple Arcade and the many latest features we previewed during WWDC for iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Cash, Apple Music, and more.
Turning to enterprise, we continue to see businesses, leveraging our entire suite of products to drive productivity and creativity for their teams and customers.
USAA, a leading insurance and financial services company, recently expanded beyond their existing iPhone and iPad deployments to provide their employees
with the latest MacBook Air. And American Express has continued to add to their fleet of over 10,000 Macs to enhance their employees' productivity, security, and
collaboration. We're also excited to see leading organizations such as Boston Children's Hospital and Lufthansa using Apple Vision Pro to build innovative spatial
computing experiences to transform the training of their workforces. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with
$153 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $4.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving us with total debt of
$101 billion. As a result, net cash was $52 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $32 billion to shareholders, including $3.9 billion
in dividends and equivalents and $26 billion through open market repurchases of 139 million Apple shares. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like
to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing
today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect foreign exchange to
continue to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 1.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. We expect our September
quarter total company revenue to grow year-over-year at a rate similar to the June quarter. We expect services revenue to grow double digits at a rate similar to
what we reported in the first three quarters of this fiscal year. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.2
billion and $14.4 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments, and
our tax rate to be around 16.5%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on August 15,
2024, to shareholders of record as of August 12, 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.

### Suhasini Chandramouli (Unknown)

Thank you Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?
Operator
Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Erik Woodring (Morgan Stanley)**: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe Tim, if we start with you, you know, I thought some of the color you provided before the call about
iPhone 15 performing better than the iPhone 14 was interesting. So just with that context, can you maybe help us understand where you see iPhone replacement
cycles today, where you think the size of the base of iPhones that are aged and likely to upgrade are, and what that translates to in potential pent-up demand, as
we enter a new iPhone cycle. And I have a follow-up, thank you.

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: Yes, hi Eric. The installed base hit an all-time high during the quarter and so we were very happy about that. iPhone in general grew in constant currency. And the
15, as you point out, if you look at the same number of weeks of the 15 from launch and compare that to the 14, the 15 is doing better than the 14. And so that's
kind of a state of where we currently are. In terms of upgrade rates, it's very difficult mid-cycle to call upgrade rates. I would just say that with Apple Intelligence,
we are very excited about the level of value that we're going to provide to users. And we believe that -- that presents another reason for a compelling upgrade.

### Exchange 002

**Erik Woodring (Morgan Stanley)**: Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks, Tim. And then second, can you maybe dig into the China dynamics a bit? Sales down 6% this quarter, 3% in constant currency,
an improvement from last quarter on a tougher compare that came on the back of some iPhone discounting. So can you maybe just share color on the China
market as a whole how much you believe promotions helped in the quarter, how sustainable this improvement is, and if this performance really changes any of
your approach to the China market as we look forward. Thanks so much.

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: Yeah, Erik, as you point out, we decreased by 6.5% year-over-year for the whole of Greater China. And if you look at it on a constant currency basis, we declined
by less than 3%. So over 50% of the decline year-over-year is currency related. That is an improvement from the first half of the fiscal year, and so we're happy to
see the acceleration. If you look at iPhone in particular for Greater China, the installed base set a record. We also in Mainland China set a June quarter record for
upgraders and so that's a very strong signal and in fact from Kantar -- the survey from Kantar this quarter showed that iPhones were the top three models in
urban China. Also, if you look at -- one of the things we look at is the 15 family compared to the 14 family for the same number of weeks from launch. So this goes
all the way back to the September of 2023. If you look at that, the 15 is outperforming the 14. And so those are some of the color I would provide. In addition, one
of the things that we're very focused on is the level of new customers buying our products. And so if you look at this on the Mac and iPad, in Mainland China, the
majority of customers buying or buying for the first time, buying that product for the first time and the watch, the vast, vast majority of people are buying a product
for the first time. And during the quarter, I should say also that iPad returned to growth in Greater China, as it did around the world. And so we continue to be
confident in the long-term opportunity in China. I don't know how every chapter of the book reads, but we're very confident in the long-term.

### Exchange 003

**Erik Woodring (Morgan Stanley)**: Great. Thanks so much.

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: We started the rollout of Apple Intelligence this week with developers, so some of the features are out there as of Monday. And we couldn't be more excited about
getting them out there. Obviously, this will enable developers to take their apps to the next level. And so we are taking the first step in getting the beta out there,
and we can't wait to see what kind of amazing things they do with it.

### Exchange 004

**Mike Ng (Goldman Sachs)**: Hi, good afternoon. I just have two questions. First, I was wondering if you could talk about whether or not you've seen a shift in demand for iPhone 15 Pro, Pro
Max models since WWDC that could potentially foreshadow consumer demand for Apple Intelligence enabled phones?

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: We just announced the sort of the requirements at the system and the silicon level in June. And so we had very limited time during the quarter. So it's really too
early to tell.

### Exchange 005

**Mike Ng (Goldman Sachs)**: That's fair. And then with the focus on upgrader potential over the next several years, I was just wondering if you could talk about what you are expecting from the
US promotional environment from your channel partners, whether that's US wireless carriers, given the importance of device sales for those partners during an
upgrade cycle. Or any retail support on what could be a very strong smartphone upgrade period? Thank you.

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: We are very excited about Apple Intelligence and what it brings, and it is another compelling reason for an upgrade. I'd leave the promotional question for the sort
of the carriers themselves to answer. But I believe it will be a very key time for -- and a compelling upgrade cycle.

### Exchange 006

**Mike Ng (Goldman Sachs)**: Great. Thank you Tim.

### Exchange 007

**Amit Daryanani (Evercore)**: Good afternoon everyone. And I have two as well. I guess, Tim, maybe back to the Apple Intelligence dynamic. There's clearly a lot of excitement from
consumers around what Apple Intelligence could mean for them. Can you just touch on your -- do you think the intent is to launch all the Apple Intelligence
features at the same time to consumers, or do you think they end up getting staggered a bit? And if they are staggered, do you think it impacts how consumers
come out and buy the next-generation iPhone?

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: The rollout, as we mentioned in June, sort of -- we've actually started with developers this week. We started with some features of Apple Intelligence, not the
complete suite. There are other features like languages beyond US English that will happen over the course of the year, and there are other features that will
happen over the course of the year. And ChatGPT is integrated by the end of the calendar year. And so yes, so it’s a staggered launch.

### Exchange 008

**Amit Daryanani (Evercore)**: Got it. And then I guess your Services growth rates have been extremely impressive for several quarters and it seems like it is accelerated recently. Can you just
touch -- talk about when you look at this double-digit growth, how much of that do you think is coming from the installed base growth versus better ARPU or better
monetization of the installed base? And how do you kind of see that mix changing as you go forward?

### Exchange 009

**Wamsi Mohan (Bank of America)**: Yes. Thank you so much. Tim, you announced Apple Intelligence, but you also announced partnerships with OpenAI and presumably more coming down the
road. How should investors think about the monetization models around these partnerships where the CapEx investments are clearly being made by these
potential partners. But you're obviously -- they're leveraging your distribution to your very attractive installed base. So in the long-term, do you see the Apple
Intelligence part -- the Services growth from Apple Intelligence being the larger contributor over time? Or do you see these partnerships becoming a larger
contributor over time? And I have a follow-up.

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: I think the way that I look at it is that Apple Intelligence is the on-device processing and the Private Cloud Compute. And a lot of that will be things with a personal
context. And then for world knowledge, we are integrating with ChatGPT initially, and that will be focused on world knowledge as I said. And so the monetization
model, I don't want to get into the terms of the commercial agreements because they are confidential between the parties. But I see both aspects as being very
important. People want both.

### Exchange 010

**Wamsi Mohan (Bank of America)**: Okay. Thanks. As a follow-up maybe for Luca. Just stepping back to the gross margin discussion again. If I look at calendar 2023, you had on average 150 basis
points increase in product gross margins on a year-on-year basis. In 2024 so far, it had been more flat year-on-year. When we think about that, is the incremental
headwind, I mean there was FX headwinds throughout the last several years. So ex-FX, are there other incremental headwinds that are either temporary or
structural in nature that are perhaps limiting further upside to what are obviously very strong gross margins? Thank you.

### Exchange 011

**Krish Sankar (Cowen)**: Hi, thanks for taking my question. And congrats on the strong results. The first one for Luca or Tim. We keep hearing about these increasing silicon content for AI
edge devices. And also, I think, Luca you spoke about increasing commodity costs. So I'm curious how to think about margins for these new AI devices. And Tim,
do any of these Apple Intelligence features need more hardware updates than what we have today? And then I have a quick follow-up.

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: Maybe I'll take the second one first and then pass it over to Luca. In terms of the requirements to run Apple Intelligence, there are system requirements and there
are silicon requirements. And so from an iPhone point of view, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will run Apple Intelligence and the successor products obviously. If
you look at the Mac, it starts with the M series of silicon that started in 2020. And the iPad is the same, and so it starts with the M series of silicon. And so there
are system requirements and silicon requirements that go with each of those.

### Exchange 012

**Krish Sankar (Cowen)**: Got it. Very helpful. And then a quick follow-up for Tim. Thanks for the color on China. We also see many other consumer discretionary and luxury brands talk
about a weak China. And I think Tim, you said half the details was FX related. I'm curious, the other half of the weakness, was that more China macro related or
do you think it is kind of like specific to Apple with domestic competitors? Any other color you could give would be very helpful. Thank you very much.

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: Well, certainly, the competitive environment there is the most competitive in the world. I've said that before and that remains to be the case. The macroeconomic
factors have been in the press too, and I'm not an expert on those. I can only tell you what we're seeing. And we were pleased that the business showed
improvement from the first half of the year.

### Exchange 013

**Krish Sankar (Cowen)**: Thanks Tim.

### Exchange 014

**David Vogt (UBS)**: Great. Two, if I may also. Tim, first one for you. I know it is early days, and you talked about the developers just getting their hands on Apple Intelligence. But
when you think about the categories that are currently in the App Store and kind of what you think app developers could do with this new technology, what's your
instinct say in terms of -- are these going to be iterative applications to currently available applications? Is there any sort of category that you think lends itself
more naturally to Apple Intelligence? Is it games? Is it more creative? I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about it. And then I have a follow-up for
Luca. Thanks.

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: If you look at how we've deployed Apple Intelligence or are deploying Apple Intelligence, we've really thought about it at pretty much all of the apps that you use
every day. And so we've thought about it from Notes to Mail to Messages and all the rest. And so there is been a deep level of thinking about how it affects those
apps. And that's going to surface Apple Intelligence in a way that is natural to the user, in a way that will I think, get them very excited about it and get usage.
Similarly, I think the developers will do that on a broad basis with their apps as well. And so I think, it is profound and we'll see what the developers do. But we're
very excited to get the initial seed out there this week and see what they do. I think it will be amazing, yes.

### Exchange 015

**David Vogt (UBS)**: Yes. No, that's helpful. I appreciate it. And Luca, just maybe -- I know you didn't give a full rundown of product categories in your prepared remarks. But if I kind of
take your comments at face value, I guess what I'm trying to think about is for the next quarter, it sounds like with Services being relatively strong and FX easing a
little bit. You are effectively saying that product revenue in the September quarter is going to basically be flat with the September quarter last year ahead of a
product launch. And so I'm just trying to get a sense for, what are the puts and takes in that sort of outlook particularly as you have Apple Intelligence hopefully
stoking the fire for demand going forward? Thanks.

### Exchange 016

**David Vogt (UBS)**: Great. Thank you very much.

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: Our objective that we said in June is to roll out US English starting in the fall and that is to users, and then proceed with more functionality, more features, if you
will, and more languages and regions coverage as we proceed across the next year. And so we sort of gave a time frame that -- and we're tracking to that.

### Exchange 017

**Samik Chatterjee (JPMorgan)**: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Tim, if I can just ask you about Apple Intelligence as well. There is a regulatory aspect as well in certain
geographies. You mentioned the staggered launch that you are aiming for and the timelines you're thinking. How are you thinking about the complexity of the
regulatory process, in particular like EU and maybe China? And does -- in terms of your timelines of the rollout, are you sort of embedding in the regulatory aspect
here? And how should we think about timing then including that? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: We are engaged as you would guess, with both regulatory bodies that you mentioned. And our objective is to move as fast as we can, obviously because our
objective is always to get features out there for everyone. We have to understand the regulatory requirements before we can commit to doing that and commit a
schedule to doing that. But we're very constructively engaged with both.

### Exchange 018

**Samik Chatterjee (JPMorgan)**: Okay, got it. And a quick one on the Wearables category, Luca. I know you mentioned the acceleration there on a sequential basis. Maybe you can just sort of
parse that out in terms of what -- which categories drove the acceleration because that's been a category that has been lagging a bit in terms of revenue trends
for the past couple of quarters. So just curious what is starting to sort of drive it to accelerate on a sequential basis? Thank you.

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: Yes, I'll take that one. I think the important thing to remember when you look at the Wearables, Home and Accessories categories is that we have a difficult
launch compare. And we've been running that for a few quarters and we still have that because last year had the continued benefit from the AirPods Pro second
generation, the Watch SE and the very first Watch Ultra. And so it is important to keep that in mind. If you sort of take a step back, however and look at the
business across the trailing 12 months, it is grown -- the Wearables, Home and Accessories business has grown to almost $40 billion, which is double what it was
five years ago.

### Exchange 019

**Samik Chatterjee (JPMorgan)**: Thank you.

**Tim Cook (CFO)**: Clearly, we have increased R&D over time. We have been investing in AI and ML for years. And in addition to investing more, we've also redeployed certain skills
onto AI and ML. And so the growth in sort of embedded in our numbers that we've shared here, it is increasing year-over-year. On the CapEx part, it is important
to remember that we employ a hybrid kind of approach, where we do things internally and we have certain partners that we do business with externally where the
CapEx would appear in their respective businesses. But yes, I mean you can expect that there is -- we will continue to invest and increase it year-on-year.
