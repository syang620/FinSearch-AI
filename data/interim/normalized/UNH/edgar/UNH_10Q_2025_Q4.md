Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

1\. Basis of Presentation

UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and the “Company”) is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. The Company’s two distinct, yet complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations the Company is privileged to serve.

The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 as filed with the SEC (2024 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly.

These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.

Revenues - Products and Services

As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, accounts receivable related to products and services were $10.1 billion and $9.9 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2025, revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts having an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, was $11.6 billion, of which approximately half is expected to be recognized in the next three years.

The Company’s unrealized losses from debt securities as of September 30, 2025 were generated from approximately 25,000 positions out of a total of 41,000 positions. The Company believes that it will timely collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities which impacted the Company’s assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of September 30, 2025, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 was not material.

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP.

For a description of the methods and assumptions that are used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2024 10-K.

Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. The assets and liabilities within our South American operations held for sale as of September 30, 2025 were measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. Fair value is measured based upon unobservable amounts, such as estimated selling price derived from Company-specific information, market conditions and third-party indications. There were no significant fair value adjustments for assets and liabilities recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 or 2024.

In June 2025, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $8.84 compared to $8.40 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2024. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change.

The following table provides details of the Company’s dividend payments during the nine months ended September 30, 2025:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | |

7\. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers, shareholders, and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices.

The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable a loss may be incurred.

Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews

The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), the Office of Personnel Management, the Office for Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and other governmental authorities. Similarly, the Company’s international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities. The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial condition or results of operations will be materially adversely affected. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS and OIG have selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans.

On February 14, 2017, the DOJ announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. In March 2025, a Special Master appointed by the court issued a report recommending that the court enter summary judgment in the Company’s favor on all remaining claims. In April 2025, the DOJ filed a motion asking the court to reject the Special Master’s report. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome which may result from this matter given its procedural status.

The Company’s planned sale of its remaining South American operations continues to progress and is now expected to close in the second half of 2026, subject to regulatory and other customary closing conditions. Assets and liabilities held for sale have been included within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, respectively.

The assets and liabilities of the held for sale disposal group as of September 30, 2025, were as follows:| | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(in millions)| | Businesses

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and with our 2024 10-K, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in that report. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to the terms “UnitedHealth Group,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” used throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refer to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 2, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 2024 10-K and in the discussion below.

UnitedHealth Group is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve.

We have four reportable segments:

•UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State.

Further information on our business is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2024 10-K and additional information on our segments can be found in this Item 2 and in Note 10 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.

Our businesses participate primarily in the United States health markets. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs.

Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefits, products and services, we start with our view of expected future costs, including medical care patterns, the mix and health status of people served, inflation and labor market dynamics. For 2025, our pricing trends and patient and member health status assumptions were well-short of the medical cost trends incurred, significantly impacting our earnings. We continually evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We seek to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions.

The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group, large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs. Continued increased medical costs may impact both future pricing and benefit design, including for our individual exchange products in markets where we choose to remain, and result in shifts between product categories for our employer benefits. These potential changes, along with certain regulatory impacts, may result in decreased membership in future periods.

Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties,” and we have observed increased care patterns as discussed below in “Medical Cost Trends,” which may impact pricing and benefit design in future periods.

Optum Health’s fully accountable value-based care businesses have been impacted by Medicare funding reductions and have also seen continued medical cost trend pressures, which may impact future pricing in the markets we continue to participate.

The Medicaid redetermination process has caused a timing mismatch between the health status of people served through Medicaid and state rate updates. Due to elevated care activity, specifically related to behavioral, pharmacy and home health, there continues to be a mismatch between the updated rates in 2025 and underlying member acuity. The funding and payment rate environment remains insufficient to meet the health needs of patients and creates the risk of continued downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs. Additionally, we expect some Medicaid membership losses in 2026 as a result of early adoption of recent legislation.

Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, care activity and prescription drug costs. We have observed increased care patterns, more notably related to physician and outpatient care, and to a lesser extent inpatient and emergency room utilization, that are above what we expected and contemplated in our pricing and benefits design. We have also observed an increase in health care unit costs and in the intensity of services delivered, driven by increases in provider pricing and additional services bundled per visit. Additionally, the member profile of newly added patients under value-based care arrangements, people served in Medicare Advantage in markets where other have plans exited, and people served within our individual exchange business have contributed to increased medical costs. These trends may continue in future periods.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) altered the Medicare Part D model and benefits, shifting more risk to plans, which results in both increased premiums and medical costs. The IRA also changed the quarterly relationship of medical costs to premiums, altering the seasonal progression and creating a more consistent relationship between medical costs and premiums throughout the year.

We endeavor to mitigate medical cost increases by engaging hospitals, physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care. Additionally, we have elevated our audit, clinical policy and payment integrity tools to protect customers and patients from unnecessary costs.

Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties

Medicare Advantage Rates. Medicare Advantage rate notices for numerous years have resulted in industry base rates well below the industry forward medical cost trend, with the Final Notice for 2026 beginning to approach the industry forward medical cost trend. Additionally, increased medical costs in 2025, which are significantly above initial cost trend estimates, adds to the compounding impact of the previous multi-year rate shortfalls creating sustained pressure on the Medicare Advantage program. Further, substantial revisions to the risk adjustment model, which serves to adjust rates to reflect a patient’s health status and care resource needs, have resulted and will continue to result in reduced funding and potentially benefits for people, especially those with some of the greatest health and social challenges.

As a result of ongoing Medicare funding pressures, there are adjustments we can make to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions for a particular period. For example, we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust member benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.

2025 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2024 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated Financial Results

The increases in revenues were primarily driven by growth in people served through Medicare Advantage and those with higher acuity needs within Medicaid, growth at Optum Rx and pricing trends.

Medical Costs and MCR

Medical costs increased primarily due to the IRA-driven impacts on Medicare Part D plans, elevated medical cost trend and growth in people served through Medicare Advantage and those with higher acuity needs. The MCR increased as a result of the revenue effects of the Medicare funding reductions, elevated medical cost trend, the member profile of newly added patients under value-based care arrangements, the seasonal impacts of the IRA on Medicare Part D and the impacts of market morbidity changes on our individual exchange offerings. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the MCR also increased due to decreased favorable reserve development, partially offset by the incremental medical costs for accommodations made to care providers in 2024 as a result of the Change Healthcare cyberattack. The acceleration of anticipated future losses related to our individual exchange offerings recorded in the second quarter of 2025 decreased the MCR for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and increased the MCR for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.

Operating Cost Ratio

The operating cost ratio for the three months ended September 30, 2025, increased primarily due to decreased gains related to business portfolio refinement, business mix and investments to support future growth; partially offset by the revenue impacts of government programs, including the IRA-driven impacts on Medicare Part D plans and operating cost management. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025 the operating cost ratio decreased due to the revenue impacts of government programs, including the IRA-driven impacts on Medicare Part D plans; operating cost management and our direct response efforts to the Change Healthcare cyberattack in 2024; partially offset by business mix, investments to support future growth and decreased gains related to business portfolio refinement.

The effective income tax rate decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 due to non-deductible losses on the sale of subsidiary and subsidiaries held for sale in 2024.

See Note 10 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including people served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by Optum Health and adjusted scripts for Optum Rx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, including the level and scope of services provided to people, and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment.

UnitedHealthcare’s revenues increased due to the IRA-driven impacts on Medicare Part D plans and growth in the number of people served through Medicare Advantage, fee-based commercial offerings and those with higher acuity needs, partially offset by decreased people served through risk-based commercial offerings and Medicaid offerings.

Earnings from operations decreased primarily due to the impacts of Medicare Advantage funding reductions, elevated medical cost trend, the impacts of market morbidity changes on our individual exchange offerings and other write-offs and settlements. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, decreased earnings from operations was also due to the seasonal impact of the IRA on Medicare Part D. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, decreased earnings from operations was partially offset by the seasonal impact of the IRA on Medicare Part D and the incremental medical costs for accommodations to support care providers in 2024 as a result of the Change Healthcare cyberattack. The acceleration of anticipated future losses related to our individual exchange offerings recorded in the second quarter of 2025 increased earnings from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and decreased operating earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.

Total revenues increased primarily due to growth at Optum Rx. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, increased revenues were partially offset by Optum Health. Earnings from operations decreased due to Optum Health, partially offset by the impacts of the Change Healthcare cyberattack in 2024. The results by segment were as follows:

Revenues at Optum Health decreased primarily due to the conversion of risk-based contracts, Medicare Advantage funding reductions and the profile of members served, partially offset by growth in patients served under value-based arrangements. Earnings from operations decreased due to Medicare Advantage funding reductions, the member profile of newly added patients under value-based care arrangements, elevated medical cost trends and decreased gains related to business portfolio refinement, partially offset by cost management initiatives. For the three months ended September 30, 2025 decreased earnings from operations was also due to lower investment income, partially offset by decreased contractual settlements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, decreased earnings from operations was also partially offset by the incremental medical costs for accommodations to support care providers in 2024 as a result of the Change Healthcare cyberattack. Optum Health served approximately 96 million people and 104 million people as of September 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024, respectively.

Revenues and earnings from operations at Optum Insight decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2025 due to lower volumes within business services, partially offset by growth in technology services and decreased impacts related to the Change Healthcare cyberattack. Revenues and earnings from operations increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 due to decreased impacts related to the Change Healthcare cyberattack and growth in technology services, partially offset by lower volumes within business services.

Revenues at Optum Rx increased due to higher script volumes from both new clients and growth in existing clients and growth in pharmacy services. Earnings from operations increased due to the factors impacting revenue and operating cost efficiencies, partially offset by decreased investment income. Optum Rx fulfilled 414 million and 407 million adjusted scripts in the third quarters of 2025 and 2024, respectively.

2025 Cash Flows Compared to 2024 Cash Flows

Decreased cash flows provided by operating activities were driven by decreased net earnings, partially offset by changes in working capital accounts and the impacts of the Change Healthcare cyberattack in 2024. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included net repayments of loans to care providers in response to the Change Healthcare cyberattack and decreased cash paid for acquisitions and other transactions, offset by decreased net issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, increased share repurchases, decreased proceeds from common stock issuances and decreased customer funds administered.

As of September 30, 2025, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and marketable equity securities balances of $76.3 billion included approximately $27.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.2 billion was available for general corporate use), $46.8 billion of debt securities and $2.2 billion of investments in marketable equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt securities portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 4.3 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of September 30, 2025. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.

Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity

In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows:

Cash Requirements. A summary of our cash requirements as of December 31, 2024 was disclosed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2024 10-K. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, there were no material changes to this previously disclosed information outside the ordinary course of business. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs. We continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including through internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and business combinations.

Short-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2024 10-K. As of September 30, 2025, we were in compliance with the various covenants under our bank credit facilities.

Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report and Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2024 10-K.

Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of September 30, 2025 were as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

| Moody’s| | S&P Global| | Fitch| | A.M. Best  
| Ratings| | Outlook| | Ratings| | Outlook| | Ratings| | Outlook| | Ratings| | Outlook  
Senior unsecured debt| A2| | Negative| | A+| | Negative| | A| | Negative| | A-| | Stable  
Commercial paper| P-1| | n/a| | A-1| | n/a| | F1| | n/a| | AMB-1| | n/a

The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital.

Regulatory Capital. As a result of an increased MCR impacting our regulated insurance and HMO subsidiaries, the specified levels of required statutory capital required to be maintained are expected to increase. We entered into various agreements with reinsurers that could limit our risk of loss under certain circumstances, thus reducing our capital and surplus requirements. These agreements do not qualify for reinsurance accounting and are therefore accounted for under deposit accounting.

While we continue to maintain significant levels of excess statutory capital in our subsidiaries, the amount of dividends our subsidiaries are able to pay to their parent companies during the remainder of 2025 will be impacted. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, our domestic insurance and HMO subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends, net of capital infusions, of $841 million.

Share Repurchase Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased approximately 12.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of $454.82 per share. As of September 30, 2025, we had Board of Directors’ authorization to purchase up to 21.0 million shares of our common stock. The Board of Directors from time to time may further amend the share repurchase program in order to increase the authorized number of shares which may be repurchased under the program.

Dividends. In June 2025, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend to an annual rate of $8.84 compared to $8.40 per share, which we had paid since June 2024. For more information on our dividend, see Note 6 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.

For additional liquidity discussion, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 in our 2024 10-K.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

There are no recently issued accounting standards that are expected to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations.

Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. For a detailed description of our critical accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 in our 2024 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2024 10-K.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this document include “forward-looking” statements which are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the federal securities laws. The words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions and trends and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors including: our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage medical costs; new or changes in existing health care laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application; cyberattacks, other privacy/data security incidents, or our failure to comply with related regulations; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under government programs; changes in Medicare, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; the DOJ’s legal actions concerning our participation in the Medicare program; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in quality scores impacting revenue; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; risks and uncertainties associated with our businesses providing pharmacy care services; competitive pressures, including our ability to maintain or increase our market share; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements; failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care payers, physicians, hospitals and other service providers; the impact of potential changes in tax laws and regulations; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to complete, manage or integrate strategic transactions; risk and uncertainties associated with the sale of our remaining operations in South America; risks associated with public health crises arising from large-scale medical emergencies, pandemics, natural disasters and other extreme events; failure to attract, develop, retain, and manage the succession of key employees and executives; our investment portfolio performance; impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets; failure to protect proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products; downgrades in our credit ratings; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or from external financings to fund our obligations, reinvest in our business, maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle, or continue repurchasing shares of our common stock.

This above list is not exhaustive. We discuss these matters, and certain risks that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations, more fully in our filings with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income.

The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of September 30, 2025 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages):

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | September 30, 2025  
Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate| | Investment  
Income Per  
Annum| | Interest  
Expense Per  
Annum| | Fair Value of  
Financial Assets| | Fair Value of  
Financial Liabilities  
2 %| | $| 728 | | | $| 576 | | | $| (4,249)| | | $| (9,525)|   
1| | 364 | | | 288 | | | (2,170)| | | (5,160)|   
(1)| | (364)| | | (273)| | | 2,210 | | | 6,284 |   
(2)| | (728)| | | (544)| | | 4,421 | | | 13,949 |

Note: The impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates may not reflect the full 100 or 200 basis point change on interest income and interest expense or on the fair value of financial assets and liabilities as the rates are assumed to not fall below zero.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

In connection with the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2025. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2025.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

A description of our legal proceedings is included in and incorporated by reference to Note 7 of Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of our 2024 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our 2024 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.

There have been no material changes to the risk factors as disclosed in our 2024 10-K.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

In November 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program, which the Board of Directors evaluates periodically. In June 2024, the Board of Directors amended our share repurchase program to authorize the repurchase of up to 35 million shares of our common stock in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured repurchase programs), in addition to all remaining shares authorized to be repurchased under the Board’s 2018 renewal of the program. There is no established expiration date for the program. The Board of Directors from time to time may further amend the share repurchase program in order to increase the authorized number of shares which may be repurchased under the program.

There were no repurchases of the Company’s common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2025. As of September 30, 2025, the Company had 21 million shares remaining available under its share repurchase authorization.

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION

Trading Arrangements

During the quarter ended September 30, 2025, none of the Company’s directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) adopted or terminated any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.

The following exhibits are filed or incorporated by reference herein in response to Item 601 of Regulation S-K. The Company files Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 under Commission File No. 1-10864.
