## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Daniel Roeska (Bernstein)**: Hey, good evening, everybody. It's Daniel from Bernstein. Elon, Tesla's share price clearly already includes quite few of the anticipated benefits you talked about
today, yet realizing what you call kind of difficult but achievable will take some time. What are you pushing the Tesla executive team to do differently now to
accelerate the innovation in order to realize the value you described for the company.

### Exchange 002

**Daniel Roeska (Bernstein)**: Okay. I mean, it sounds like you've got a conviction that the pieces you need, right, are in place. If we kind of go 12 months down the line and we look back, and
you had some of those, but maybe what are the kind of two or three KPIs that would tell you that you're on track and it's going the right way and the pieces you've
put in place are the right pieces, right? That's kind of what I'm looking for or other way around, where would it be off most likely in your mind that you say, hey, I
need to go back there and I need to change something to enable the team better?

### Exchange 003

**Adam Jonas (Morgan Stanley)**: Thanks everybody. So, Elon, you've said in the past about LiDAR, for AVs at least, that LiDAR is a crutch, a fool's errand. I think you even told me once, even if it
was free, you'd say you wouldn't use it. Do you still feel that way?

### Exchange 004

**Adam Jonas (Morgan Stanley)**: Care to elaborate or just, I have another question.

### Exchange 005

**Adam Jonas (Morgan Stanley)**: I got it. All right. So you're still -- people think you're crazy for not looking to LiDAR.

### Exchange 006

**Adam Jonas (Morgan Stanley)**: Right. You understand how light are works. I get it.

### Exchange 007

**Adam Jonas (Morgan Stanley)**: Yeah. All right. Just as a follow up. At CES, you said, I'm paraphrasing, that any AI will be able to do any cognitive task not involving atoms within the next three
or four years. And that would imply, Elon, that before the end of President Trump's term in office, that AI would be moving pretty damn quickly into the physical
world, into the world of photons and atoms. And I'm thinking, given your work with the administration, how confident are you that the US will have the
manufacturing and the supply base to make good on your excitement about physical AI by the end of -- by latter this decade. We seem pretty vulnerable right
now. I've seen you tweeting about, or sorry, X-ing, excuse me, Elon, about China, Freudian slip, about China having like making more drones in a day than the
US makes in a year and all the entanglement of the supply. So, what has to happen in the US to make that possible? What's your message and what can what
can you do about it and what's relevant for Tesla shareholders? Thanks, Elon.

### Exchange 008

**Adam Jonas (Morgan Stanley)**: Great. Thank you very much. The next question will come from Pierre Ferragu at New Street. Pierre, please feel free to unmute yourself.

### Exchange 009

**Dan Levy (Barclays)**: Great. Good evening. Thank you for taking other questions. Elon, you've talked about the need for proliferation of sustainable transport in the past as part of sort
of broader push to sustainable energy. Look, I know we've heard a lot about President Trump's plans to reverse the EV Mandate and I think there's a view that
given regulation is a driver of EV uptake, this could slow EV uptake in the US. So, what would be your view on the right policy in the US, given your comments in
the past of the need to push for sustainable transport?

### Exchange 010

**Dan Levy (Barclays)**: Great. And then as a follow up, in the past, Elon, you had made a comment that, you'd be willing to sell cars at effectively no margin to get the cars out there. And
there's a comment in the release today of the rate of acceleration of autonomy efforts does impact volume growth. So perhaps you could just talk about, with your
efforts on FSD, how we should think about your desire to put more vehicles out in the market to take advantage of your tech advances.

### Exchange 011

**Dan Levy (Barclays)**: Yeah. More so just how much more aggressively you would be willing to sell your cars versus in light of your improvements on FSD.
