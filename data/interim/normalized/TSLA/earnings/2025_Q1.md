## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Colin Langan (Wells Fargo)**: Great. Do you hear me?

### Exchange 002

**Colin Langan (Wells Fargo)**: You’re still sticking with division-only approach. A lot of autonomous people still have a lot of concerns about sun glare, fog, dust. Any color on how you anticipate
on getting around those issues? Because of my understanding, it kind of blinds the camera when you get glare and stuff.

### Exchange 003

**Colin Langan (Wells Fargo)**: So the camera is able to see when there’s direct glare on it. I’m little surprised by that. Okay.

### Exchange 004

**Colin Langan (Wells Fargo)**: Okay. And then just there are obviously media reports the other day that the affordable model was delayed. It doesn’t sound like that’s correct. Those reports also
talked about it being more of a cheaper version of the Model Y. Any color on what we should expect? Is it a cheaper version of Model Y, or is it actually going to
be a design change with it?

### Exchange 005

**Adam Jonas (Morgan Stanley)**: Sorry, guys. Technology.

### Exchange 006

**Adam Jonas (Morgan Stanley)**: Yeah. Hi. Yeah. In the February 28 Joe Rogan interview, Elon, you advocated for a ramp in tariffs, to give people time to adjust. Otherwise, quote, you said the
system would break, and bad things would happen. So are things breaking yet? And if the announced -- as if the tariffs as announced remain in place, when
would things start breaking?

### Exchange 007

**Adam Jonas (Morgan Stanley)**: Okay, Elon. I respect that. Just as just as a follow-up, and thanks again. Between China and the United States, who in your opinion is further ahead on the
development of physical AI, specifically on humanoids, and also drones? I’d be interested in. And is it even close and kind of how, yeah seriously.
