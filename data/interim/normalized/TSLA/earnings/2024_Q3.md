## Prepared Remarks

### Travis Axelrod (Unknown)

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Third Quarter 2024 Q&A webcast. My name is Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations, and I am joined
today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja and a number of other executives. Our Q3 results were announced at about 3 P.M. Central Time in the update deck we
published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are
based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those
mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?

## Q&A Session

### Exchange 001

**Adam Jonas (Morgan Stanley)**: Okay, thanks, everybody. I just had a question about the relationship between Tesla and xAI. Many investors are still not clear how the work at xAI is truly
beneficial to Tesla. Some even take the view that the two companies may even be in competition with each other in terms of talent and tech and even your time,
Elon. So what's your message to investors on that relationship between Tesla and xAI? And where do you see it going over time?
