You're kind of thinking about the second quarter. Any other factors you're seeing in advertising verticals or regions or categories that could be\nshowing any signs of weakness quarter dates? We should think through any other changes from typical seasonality in 2Q '25 versus prior quarters? Then the\nsecond one on Philipp, I think I heard you mention now the volume of commercial queries has increased. Maybe can you just walk us through which of the\nproducts are driving that increase in commercial queries.

You just put up record high or multi-year \nrecord high margins for both Google Services and for Google Cloud. You talked, Philipp, about depreciation expenses accelerating rapidly throughout the year\n\nbecause of all the investments you've already you'd warn people about. Back in the September quarter, you seemed relatively confident that you had enough\nlevers to kind of offset kind of rising infrastructure costs. Was that still your, six months later, is that still your view that you've got enough levers that even with the\nrising infrastructure costs you can there's enough in there to kind of counterbalance that. And then just briefly on Waymo, it continues to rise aggressively, the\nnumbers, Sundar. The long-term business model for Waymo. Is there a reason to make a decision on that soon or have you already made the decision on\nwhether this is a long-term licensing model or you really want to run this as a standalone ride-sharing delivery autonomous vehicle business.
