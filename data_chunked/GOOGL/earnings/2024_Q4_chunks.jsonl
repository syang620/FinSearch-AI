And then Anat, just on the -- on cloud growth, a little bit of decel 3Q to 4Q, but it sounded\nlike you also suggested that your capacity constrained in the fourth quarter.

How much more efficient do you think you guys\nare in terms of generating 1 million tokens compared to inference costs running on your cloud peers? Do you see this as an advantage as everything shifts to\ninference? And then Anat, you call out lapping the financial services category strength in 2025 as a bit of a problem for Search.
