At the same time, the M5 \nMacBook Pro raises the bar for what users can do with a laptop while the new M5 powered Apple Vision Pro opens up amazing possibilities on its infinite canvas. \nWe also launched a beautiful new software design that creates a unified experience across all of our platforms for the very first time. The design is crafted with a \nnew material called liquid glass that brings fluidity, vitality and flexibility to our products. Along with the new design, we delivered powerful new features to enable \nusers to do even more with their devices. That includes updates to the phone and messages apps in iOS 26 to help users stay connected, continuity \nenhancements in MAC to deliver an even more seamless experience across devices and a powerful new windowing system that fundamentally transforms the \nuser experience in iPad OS 26. As we continue to expand our investment in AI, we're bringing intelligence to more of what people already love about our products \nand services, making every experience even more personal, capable and effortless.

These incredibly advanced chips make Apple products the very best place to experience the power of AI. With Features like live translation, which help users communicate across languages in real time and visual intelligence, which opens new ways to learn about and \nexplore the world.

Now let's take a closer look at the September \nquarter results across our lineup, starting with iPhone. iPhone set a revenue record for the September quarter at $49 billion, up 6% from a year ago, with growth \nin the vast majority of markets we track despite supply constraints we faced on several iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 models given strong demand. Redesigned from \nthe inside out and powered by the outstanding A19 pro chip, the iPhone 17 Pro is by far the most powerful iPhone we've ever made, setting a whole new \nstandard for the smartphone industry. The iPhone 17 Pro also offers our best camera system ever with an all-new ADEX telephoto camera and look stunning with \nbold new finishes like COSMIC Orange. The iPhone Air introduces an incredibly breakthrough design and with a bigger and brighter display with promotion, the \niPhone 17 is a fantastic upgrade packed with features users will love. In MAC, we had a strong September quarter with revenue of $8.7 billion, up 13% \nyear-over-year driven by the strength of the MacBook Air. The MacBook Air enables users to get things done easily on the world's most popular laptop.

As I mentioned earlier, revenue was $28.8 billion for the September quarter, 15% higher year-over-year and an all-time record. We\nsaw double-digit growth in both developed and emerging markets and set new all-time records across advertising, App Store, cloud services, Music, payment\nservices and video. Apple TV celebrated a big night at this year's Emmy Awards with 22 wins. The studio led the night with 13 wins the most of any comedy\nseries in Emmy's history. Severance topped all dramas with 8 wins, adding to the accolades for this landmark series. To date, Apple TV productions have now\nearned over 600 wins and 2,800 nominations in total, driven by powerful original storytelling. And we're excited for audiences to discover new productions like\nPluribus and to catch returning favorites like slow horses and the morning show. And soon, Apple TV will be the destination for F1 fans across the U.S. on track\nDay, thanks to a new partnership with Formula One. F1 is one of the most exciting and fastest-growing sports in the world. And starting next year, Apple TV will\nbe the place for subscribers to follow every twist and turn of the new season.

Apple News provides access to front page\nnews from all around the world, putting hundreds of publications right at users' fingertips. Turning to retail. We're heading into our busiest time of year with our\nbest ever lineup. In the last few months, we've opened new stores in emerging markets like India and the UAE and new locations in the U.S. and China. I was\nalso in Tokyo last month for the opening of the redesigned and reimagined Apple Ginza store and the energy among the crowd was truly remarkable. When it\noriginally opened, it was our first store outside the United States, and so it was especially meaningful to come back to welcome customers to the beautiful new\nspace. Everywhere we operate, and in everything we do, we strive to give the best to our users while living by our values, whether that's building new accessibility\nfeatures into our most recent software releases or advancing our environmental work by using even more recycled materials in our latest lineup or providing free\neducational programming to train and support American businesses with our new Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit. And we're continuing to invest in\ninnovation and user experiences that will transform our future. A great example is the work we're doing in the U.S. where we're committed to invest $600 billion\nover the next 4 years with a focus on innovation in strategic areas like advanced manufacturing, silicon engineering and artificial intelligence. These commitments\nbuild on our long-standing investments in America, while supporting more than 450,000 jobs with thousands of suppliers across all 50 states. We built a new\nfactory in Houston for advanced AI service, for example, which just started shipping its first products off the line, and we're leading the creation of end-to-end\nsilicon supply chain across the country", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:13:04Z"}

Operating cash flow was also a September quarter record at $29.7 billion. Now I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. \niPhone revenue was $49 billion, up 6% year-over-year, driven by the iPhone 16 family. iPhone grew in the vast majority of the markets we track with September \nquarter records in many emerging markets, including Latin America, the Middle East and South Asia and an all-time record in India.

Let's turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $132 billion in cash and marketable securities. We had $1.3\nbillion of debt maturities and decreased commercial paper by $1.9 billion, resulting in $99 billion in total debt. Therefore, at the end of the quarter, net cash was\n$34 billion. During the quarter, we returned $24 billion to shareholders. This included $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20 billion through open market\nrepurchases of 89 million Apple shares. Taking a step back, we are very pleased with our record fiscal year 2025 results. As Tim mentioned, total company\nrevenue for the year was $416 billion with growth in iPhone, Mac, iPad and Services and all-time records in the vast majority of markets we track. This revenue\nperformance led to very strong full year operating results with all-time records for net income and for diluted EPS, which grew double digits year-over-year on an\nadjusted basis. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information Suhasini\nreferred to. Importantly, the color we're providing assumes that the global tariff rates, policies and application remain in effect as of this call and the global\nmacroeconomic outlook does not worsen from today. We expect our December quarter total company revenue to grow by 10% to 12% year-over-year, which will\nbe our best quarter ever. We expect iPhone revenue to grow double digits year-over-year, which would be our best iPhone quarter ever. On Mac, keep in mind,\nwe expect to face a very difficult compare against the M4 MacBook Pro, Mac Mini and iMac launches in the year ago quarter. We expect services revenue to\ngrow at a year-over-year rate similar to what we reported in the fiscal year 2025. We expect gross margin to be between 47% and 48%, which includes an\nestimated impact of $1.4 billion of tariff-related costs. And as we've said before, we are significantly increasing our investments in AI, while continuing to invest in\nour product road map. And so for the December quarter, we expect operating expenses to be between $18.1 billion and $18.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be\naround $150 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 17%. Finally, today, our Board\nof Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share of common stock payable on November 13, 2025, to shareholders of record as of November 10,\n2025. With that, let's open the call to questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator\nCertainly, we will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:13:04Z"}
