Apple assumes no\nobligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory\nremarks. Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Before I talk about our results I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the \ndevastating wildfires that impacted the Los Angeles area this month. From our retail teams to Apple TV+, Apple Music, Fitness Plus, Beats and more LA is home \nto many of our team members. Our thoughts are with everyone who is beginning the road to recovery. For our part, we are contributing to the relief efforts and we \nwill continue to support our teams and the local community. Now turning to the quarter. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $124.3 billion for the December \nquarter, up 4% from a year ago, and an all-time record. EPS also set an all-time record of $2.40, 10% higher year-over-year. We achieved all-time revenue \nrecords across the majority of the countries and regions we track, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia Pacific. We also continue to see \nmomentum in emerging markets, setting all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia, among \nothers. In services, we achieved an all-time revenue record, and in the past year, we've seen nearly $100 billion in revenue from our services business. I'm also \npleased to announce that we reached a new record for our installed base with over 2.35 billion active devices. In October, we released the first set of Apple \nIntelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and we rolled out more features and expanded to more countries in December. Now users can \ndiscover the benefits of these new features in the things they do every day. They can use writing tools to help find just the right words, create fun and unique \nimages with Image Playground and Genmoji, handle daily tasks and seek out information with a more natural and conversational Siri, create movies of their \nmemories with a simple prompt, and touch up their photos with clean up. We introduced visual intelligence with camera control to help users instantly learn about \ntheir surroundings. Users can also seamlessly access chat GPT across iOS, iPadOS and MacOS. And we were excited to recently begin our international \nexpansion with Apple Intelligence now available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. We're working hard to take Apple Intelligence \neven further. In April, we're bringing Apple Intelligence to more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and \nsimplified Chinese, as well", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:13:05Z"}

Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovations we've made across hardware and software to transform how users experience our products. Apple \nIntelligence also empowers users by delivering personal context that's relevant to them. And importantly, Apple Intelligence is a breakthrough for privacy and AI \nwith innovations like Private Cloud Compute, which extends the industry-leading security and privacy of Apple devices into the cloud. Apple Intelligence opens up \nan exciting new frontier and is already elevating experiences across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. We're going to keep investing in innovation and in transformative \ntools that help users in their everyday lives. Let me now turn to our results for the quarter, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $69.1 billion, reaching \nall-time iPhone revenue records in dozens of markets and regions. Our iPhone 16 lineup takes the smartphone experience to the next level in so many ways, and \nApple Intelligence is one of many reasons why customers are excited. With the A18 powered iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, users are getting a big boost in \nbattery life and incredible camera experiences with camera control. Our amazingly powerful iPhone 16 Pro models go even further with larger-than-ever displays \nand a pro camera system so advanced it can turn moments into masterpieces. In Mac, revenue was $9 billion for the December quarter, 16% higher \nyear-over-year, driven by significant excitement around the world for our latest Mac lineup. The Mac is more than just a powerful tool. It's a launchpad to enable \nusers to bring their best ideas and boldest creations to life. And there are so many reasons to choose Mac, from the breathtaking performance of the M4 family of \nchips to the groundbreaking and growing capabilities of Apple Intelligence. Every product in the Mac lineup offers something extraordinary, whether that's the \nsuper portable MacBook Air, the powerhouse MacBook Pro, the world's best all-in-one iMac, or the small wonder that is the Mac Mini, which is not only stunningly \ncapable, but is our first carbon neutral Mac. All of this is enabled by the unparalleled power of Apple Silicon. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% from a year \nago, driven by strong interest for our latest products. We love hearing from customers, who are discovering for the first time the versatility of iPad from the \nultra-portal iPad Mini, built from the ground up for Apple intelligence, to the powerful M4 iPad Pro in a stunningly thin and light design. iPad is there for our users \nwhenever they need it and wherever they go and we are pleased to see so much excitement and enthusiasm for our lineup. Wearables home and accessories \nrevenue came in at $11.7 billion. With its most advanced display yet and a thinner more comfortable design, the all-new Apple Watch Series 10 is the perfect \ncompanion to help users pursue their health and fitness goals this year.

We set all-time records in the \nAmericas, Europe, and rest of Asia-Pacific, and a December quarter record in Japan. Five years since launch, Apple TV+ continues to be home to incredible \nstorytelling that viewers love. There's nothing quite like the anticipation that comes when a fan favorite returns, and we were thrilled to debut the second season \nof Severance earlier this month. We have so much in store for our subscribers this year with new shows like The Studio and Your Friends and Neighbors. And we \ncan't wait for the premiere of Formula 1 starring Brad Pitt on June 27, which will take viewers inside the sport in a truly unprecedented way. We're excited that \nApple TV+ continues to draw attention and accolades. To-date, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins. During the \nquarter, we were also excited to launch a new Find My Service that can help our users when they lose their luggage.

We can't wait to welcome customers to the first of several flagship store locations in Saudi Arabia that were opening beginning\nin 2026. I just had the chance to visit both countries last month, and I had a great time meeting with customers and team members. There's an incredible energy\nand passion for technology in these growing markets. Every day, I get deeply moving notes about the many ways our technology is enriching our users' lives. I\nrecently got a note from a customer who put his watch on his father's wrist when he feared something was wrong with him. The watch alerted them that the father\nwas an AFib and they were able to get him to the hospital for potentially life-saving treatment. Another user put his new watch on for the first time and within 15\nminutes was notified of a low heart rate that led to a necessary pacemaker.

Let me quickly summarize our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $141 billion in cash and\nmarketable securities. We repaid $1 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8 billion, resulting in $97 billion in total debt. Therefore, net\ncash at the end of the quarter was $45 billion. During the quarter, we returned over $30 billion to shareholders. This included $3.9 billion in dividends and\nequivalents and $23.3 billion through open market repurchases of 100 million Apple shares. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program\nwhen we report results for the March quarter. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking\ninformation that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from\nwhat we're projecting today for the current quarter. As the dollar is strengthened significantly, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind and to have a\nnegative impact on revenue of about 2.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Despite that headwind, we expect our March quarter total company\nrevenue to grow low to mid-single-digits year-over-year. We expect services revenue to grow low-double-digits year-over-year. When you remove the negative\nimpact of the foreign exchange headwinds I described earlier, the year-over-year growth rate would be comparable to that of the December quarter. We expect\ngross margin to be between 46.5% and 47.5%. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.1 billion and $15.3 billion. We expect OI&E to be around\nnegative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our\nBoard of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on February 13, 2025, to shareholders of record as of February 10,\n2025. With that, let's open to call the questions. Thank you, Kevin. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions.

It's helpful. And then, you know, if we just touch on China, obviously, in the news fairly frequently, if we set aside China Macro,\nwhich I understand is still challenging, can you maybe talk about the headwinds that that Apple faces, whether that's, you know, shifting preferences for Western\ntechnology brands in favor of domestic vendors, or is this just a function of not necessarily having Apple intelligence available with the iPhone 16, which is, you\nknow, not necessarily helping replacement cycles. Just maybe double clicking on, on what you think and what you're hearing in China as a regard as it relates to\nthe iPhone. Thanks so much. Yes, sure. If you look at our greater China revenue for the quarter, we were down 11% year-over-year. And over half of the decline that we experienced was\ndriven by change in channel inventory from the beginning to the end of the quarter. And of course on the Apple intelligence side we have not rolled out in China\nand as we just talked about we did see better results in the markets that we had rolled out in than markets we hadn't rolled out in. And of course, it's the most\ncompetitive market in the world. And so all of those things are true. In terms of the macro situation, there was a fiscal stimulus or subsidy announced in very\nrecently in January that did not affect the December quarter. There were some provincial subsidies in the December quarter, but the national program was\nannounced, I believe, on January 20. And it does cover the categories that we have products in from smartphones to tablets and PCs and smart watches up to a\ncertain, a maximum price point. And so we do see fiscal stimulus occurring and we'll be glad to talk about what that looks like on the next call.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:13:05Z"}

Has Apple\nIntelligence played a role in helping upgrades in the markets that you've launched in? Thanks. Yes, thank you for the question. If you look at iPhone, we did set an all-time record for upgraders, so we've never seen a higher level of upgraders before. The\ninstalled base hit a new all-time high as well. And if you look at the 16, compared to the 15 from launch, which occurred, as you know, in September, so this is\nacross now two quarters from September to the end of the December fiscal quarter, the 16 outperformed the 15.

So how do we square kind of the momentum versus kind of the iPhone business effectively really kind of unchanged over the last couple of years? And\nthen second, when I think about kind of the gross margin profile of the business, obviously, you've done a great job in taking gross margins up. Where do you\nthink we sit in terms of, on the services side at least, where margins could go? It looks like the 75% margin has been incredibly successful quarter. But just trying\nto get a sense for where do you think this number could go over the intermediate term? Thank you. Yes. If you look at Apple Intelligence, what my point earlier was, that markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence during the Q1 period performed better on \na year-over-year basis than markets where we had not. And so that gives us -- it's a positive indicator that we were pleased with. There are many compelling \nreasons to upgrade. And the other thing I would say, that I think I mentioned earlier, is that if you look at it from a launch to the end of the December quarter, and\n\nso that goes back to September, the 16 family is outperforming the 15 family.

Just\nwondering how much of that was driven by some of the Mac silicon innovation versus a replacement cycle for Macs? I don't know the answer to your question precisely, but I think it is a combination of these products are so compelling, the M4-based products are so compelling,\nthat it's driving both upgrades at the double-digit level and it's driving switchers at a double-digit level.

I know I get 100s of\ne-mails a day, and the summarization function is so important. So I think it's a combination of that.
