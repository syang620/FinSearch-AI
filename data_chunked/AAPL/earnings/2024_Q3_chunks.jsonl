Thank you Suhasini. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% \nfrom a year ago and better than we had expected. EPS grew double digits to $1.40 and achieved a record for the June quarter. We also set quarterly revenue \nrecords in more than two dozen countries and regions, including Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, the UK, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. And \nwe set an all-time revenue record in services which grew 14%. At our Worldwide Developers Conference, we were thrilled to unveil game-changing updates \nacross our platforms, including Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovation and investment in AI and Machine Learning. It will transform \nhow users interact with technology, from writing tools to help you express yourself, to image playground, which gives you the ability to create fun images and \ncommunicate in new ways, to powerful tools for summarizing and prioritizing notifications. Siri also becomes more natural, more useful, and more personal than \never. Apple Intelligence is built on a foundation of privacy, both through on-device processing that does not collect users' data and through private cloud compute, \na groundbreaking new approach to using the cloud, while protecting users' information powered by Apple silicon. We are also integrating ChatGPT into \nexperiences within iPhone, Mac, and iPad, enabling users to draw on a broad base of world knowledge. We are very excited about Apple Intelligence and we \nremain incredibly optimistic about the extraordinary possibilities of AI and its ability to enrich customers' lives. We will continue to make significant investments in \nthis technology and dedicate ourselves to the innovation that will unlock its full potential. Recently, we've also been excited to bring Apple Vision Pro to more \ncountries, giving customers the chance to discover the remarkable capabilities of this magical device. Vision Pro users are customizing their own workspaces, \nwatching movies on 100-foot screens, and exploring entire worlds with just a pinch of their fingertips. With more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million \ncompatible apps for Vision OS, the developer community continues to pioneer stunning spatial experiences that are only possible with Vision Pro. Last month, we \nannounced that we're bringing some amazing new immersive content to Vision Pro, including new series, concerts, films, and more. And we've seen great \ninterest for Vision Pro in the enterprise, where it can empower companies large and small to pursue their best ideas like never before.

We are doing that across every \nproduct and every service. Now let me share more detail in our June quarter results, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% \nyear-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we grew compared to last year. Customers continue to praise the iPhone 15 lineup for its incredible battery life, \nexceptional cameras, and unmatched power and performance. And we are excited to bring incredible new features to the iPhone with iOS 18, making it more \npersonal, capable, and intelligent than ever before. This update includes the biggest redesign of the Photos app, new customization options for the home screen, \nmessages over satellite, and the introduction of Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence utilizes the power of our most advanced iPhones, the iPhone 15 Pro and inch MacBook Air. With back-to-school season upon us, MacBook Air is the perfect companion for students on campus and small business owners, developers, \nand creatives of all kinds depend on Mac to do more than they ever could before. Powered by Apple silicon with its neural engine and privacy built in at the chip \nlevel, Macs are simply the best personal computers for AI. And every Mac we've shipped with Apple silicon since 2020, is capable of taking advantage of Apple \nIntelligence with Mac OS Sequoia. We also know the importance of security for our users and enterprises so we continue to advance protections across our \nproducts. Turning to iPad, revenue was $7.2 billion, 24% higher year-over-year. During the quarter, we had an incredible launch where we unveiled the all-new 11 \nand 13 inch iPad Air, the perfect device for education, entertainment, and so much more. And With the new iPad Pro, we pushed the boundaries of \npower-efficient performance with the remarkable M4 chip, the engine behind this incredibly thin device. By leveraging the latest in Apple silicon, Video Editors and \nMusicians can take advantage of the cutting edge AI features in Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro. And we're very excited that iPad Pro and iPad Air models powered \nby the M series of Apple silicon will be able to utilize the powerful capabilities of Apple Intelligence. In wearables, home, and accessories, revenue was $8.1 \nbillion, down 2% from a year ago. Apple Watch is empowering users to live a healthier day with a range of tools to take charge of their wellness journeys. At the \ncore of Apple Watch, are powerful AI features that are helping users get help when they need it most, from irregular heart rhythm notifications to walking \nsteadiness to crash detection and fall detection. I've heard time and again how meaningful these features are for users and their loved ones, and their stories \nmotivate us to keep pushing forward on this vital work. As I mentioned earlier, in services, we set an all-time revenue record of $24.2 billion with paid \nsubscriptions climbing to an all-time high. We achieve revenue records in the majority of the services categories with all-time revenue records in advertising, \ncloud, and payment services.

We are very pleased to report a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year, despite\n230 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact. We achieved growth in the vast majority of our markets, with June quarter revenue records in the\nAmericas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $61.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Our\ninstalled base of active devices reach an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to our unmatched levels of customer satisfaction and\nloyalty and a large number of customers who are new to our products. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with\nan all-time record in developed markets and a June quarter record in emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.3% near the high end of our guidance\nrange and down 30 basis points sequentially driven by a different mix within products which was partially offset by a favorable mix shift towards services and cost\nsavings. Products gross margin was 35.3%, down 130 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin\nwas 74% down 60 basis points from last quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided and up 7%\nyear-over-year. Net income was $21.4 billion, diluted EPS of $1.40 was up 11% year-over-year and set a June quarter record. And operating cash flow was very\nstrong at $28.9 billion, also a June quarter record. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1%\nyear-over-year, but grew on a constant currency basis.

During the June\nquarter, many iPhone models were among the top selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top selling\nmodel in the US, urban China, the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan. Customer satisfaction on the iPhone 15 family continues to be extremely high, with 451\nResearch measuring it at 98% in the US in their latest reports. Mac generated $7 billion in revenue, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the MacBook Air powered by\nthe M3 chip. We saw particularly strong performance in our emerging markets, with June quarter records for Mac in Latin America, India, and South Asia. The\nMac installed base reached an all-time high with half of MacBook Air customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And customer satisfaction for Mac was recently\nreported at 96% in the US. iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, up 24% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air.

Wearables, home and accessories revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year, a sequential acceleration from the March quarter. Watch\nand AirPods continue to face a difficult compare against prior year launches of the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. Apple\nWatch continues to attract new customers, with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending\nthe Apple Watch install base to a new all-time high.

We repaid $4.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving us with total debt of\n$101 billion. As a result, net cash was $52 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $32 billion to shareholders, including $3.9 billion\nin dividends and equivalents and $26 billion through open market repurchases of 139 million Apple shares. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like\nto review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing\ntoday assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect foreign exchange to\ncontinue to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 1.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. We expect our September\nquarter total company revenue to grow year-over-year at a rate similar to the June quarter. We expect services revenue to grow double digits at a rate similar to\nwhat we reported in the first three quarters of this fiscal year. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.2\nbillion and $14.4 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments, and\nour tax rate to be around 16.5%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on August 15,\n2024, to shareholders of record as of August 12, 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions. Thank you Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator\nCertainly.

And I have a follow-up, thank you. Yes, hi Eric. The installed base hit an all-time high during the quarter and so we were very happy about that. iPhone in general grew in constant currency. And the\n15, as you point out, if you look at the same number of weeks of the 15 from launch and compare that to the 14, the 15 is doing better than the 14.

So over 50% of the decline year-over-year is currency related. That is an improvement from the first half of the fiscal year, and so we're happy to\nsee the acceleration. If you look at iPhone in particular for Greater China, the installed base set a record. We also in Mainland China set a June quarter record for\nupgraders and so that's a very strong signal and in fact from Kantar -- the survey from Kantar this quarter showed that iPhones were the top three models in\nurban China. Also, if you look at -- one of the things we look at is the 15 family compared to the 14 family for the same number of weeks from launch. So this goes\nall the way back to the September of 2023. If you look at that, the 15 is outperforming the 14. And so those are some of the color I would provide. In addition, one\nof the things that we're very focused on is the level of new customers buying our products. And so if you look at this on the Mac and iPad, in Mainland China, the\nmajority of customers buying or buying for the first time, buying that product for the first time and the watch, the vast, vast majority of people are buying a product\nfor the first time. And during the quarter, I should say also that iPad returned to growth in Greater China, as it did around the world. And so we continue to be\nconfident in the long-term opportunity in China. I don't know how every chapter of the book reads, but we're very confident in the long-term.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:13:05Z"}
