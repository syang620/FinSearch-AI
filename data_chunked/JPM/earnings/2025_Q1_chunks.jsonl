Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $14.6 billion, EPS of $5.07 on revenue of $46 billion with an ROTCE \nof 21%. These results included a First Republic related gain of $588 million, which was previously disclosed in the 10-K. On Page 2, we have more on our first \nquarter results. The firm reported revenue of $46 billion, up $3.5 billion or 8% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was down $430 million or 2%, driven by the impact of \nlower rates and deposit margin compression as well as lower deposit balances in CCB. This was predominantly offset by higher card revolving balances, the \nimpact of securities activity, including from prior quarters, as well as higher wholesale deposits. NIR ex. Markets was up $2.2 billion or 20%, and excluding the \nsignificant item I just mentioned was up 14%, largely on higher asset management fees, lower net investment securities losses and higher investment banking \nfees. And Markets revenue was up $1.7 billion or 21%. Expenses of $23.6 billion were up $840 million or 4%, largely driven by compensation, including growth in \nemployees across the front office and technology, higher brokerage and distribution fees, as well as marketing and legal expense. The quarter also reflected a \n$323 million release of the FDIC special assessment accrual compared with a $725 million increase in the prior quarter. Credit costs were $3.3 billion, with net \ncharge-offs of $2.3 billion and a net reserve build of $973 million We have more details on the reserve build on Page 3. With this quarter's reserve build, firm's \ntotal allowance for credit losses is $27.6 billion. Let's take a second to add a little bit of context to our thinking surrounding this number in light of the unique \nenvironment of the last several weeks. Our first quarter allowance is anchored on the relatively benign central case economic outlook, which was in effect at the \nend of the quarter. But in light of the significantly elevated risks and uncertainties at the time, we increased the probability weightings associated with the \ndownside scenarios in our CECL framework. As a result, the weighted average unemployment rate embedded in our allowance is 5.8%, up from 5.5% last \nquarter, driving the $973 million increase in the allowance. So, with that in mind, the consumer build of $441 million was driven by changes in the weighted \naverage macroeconomic outlook. The wholesale build of $549 million was predominantly driven by credit quality changes on certain exposures and net lending \nactivity as well as changes in the outlook. In addition, it's important to note that the increase in the allowance is not, to any meaningful degree, driven by \ndeterioration in the actual credit performance in the portfolio, which remains largely in line with expectations. With that, let's go to balance sheet and capital on \nPage 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.4%, down 30 basis points versus the prior quarter as net income and OCI gains were more than offset by \ncapital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter, the firm distributed $11 billion of capital to shareholders, which reflects $7.1 billion of net common share \nrepurchases and the payment of our common dividend, which has been increased to $1.40 per share. This quarter's higher RWA is primarily driven by overall \nbusiness growth in Markets and some seasonal effects. Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on Page 5. Consumers and small businesses remain \nfinancially healthy. Despite the recent downtrends in consumer and small business sentiment based on our data, spend, cash buffers, payment to income ratios \nand credit utilization are all", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:20:15Z"}

Moving to the financial results, CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $18.3 billion, which \nwas up 4% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 1% year-on-year, driven by lower deposit NII, predominantly offset by growth in \nWealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially, while end-of-period deposits were up 2% quarter-on-quarter. \nClient investment assets were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance and we continue to see strong flows into managed products. In Services & Auto, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card NII and higher revolving balances, as well as higher operating lease income in \nAuto. Card outstandings were up 10% due to strong account acquisition. And in Auto, originations were $10.7 billion, up 20%, driven by higher lease volume. \nExpenses of $9.9 billion were up 6% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in marketing and technology, higher field compensation, as well as higher auto \nlease depreciation. Credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion, up $275 million year-on-year, predominantly driven by the seasoning of \nrecent vintages in Card with delinquencies and losses in line with expectations. The net reserve build was $475 million, of which $400 million was in Card. Next, \nthe Commercial & Investment Bank on Page 6. CIB reported net income of $6.9 billion on revenue of $19.7 billion, which is up 12% year-on-year. IB fees were up \n12% year-on-year and we ranked #1 with wallet share of 9%. In advisory, fees were up 16%, benefiting from the closing of deals announced in 2024. Debt \nunderwriting fees were up 16%, primarily driven by elevated refinancing activity, particularly in leveraged finance. In equity underwriting, fees were down 9% \nyear-on-year, reflecting challenging market conditions. In light of market conditions, we are adopting a cautious stance on the investment banking outlook. While \nclient engagement and dialogue is quite elevated, both the conversion of the existing pipeline and origination of new activity will require a reduction in the current \nlevels of uncertainty. Payments revenue was up 3% year-on-year, excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, predominantly \noffset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was up 11% year-on-year, driven by lower losses on hedges, partially offset by lower balances. Moving to \nMarkets, total revenue was up 21% year-on-year, reflecting record performance in equities. Fixed Income was up 8% with better performance in rates and \ncommodities against a relatively weak prior-year quarter. Equities was up 48% as the business performed well during a period of elevated volatility supported by \nhigher client activity and strong monetization of flows, particularly in derivatives.

Revenue of $5.7 \nbillion was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, as well as higher \nbrokerage activity and higher deposit balances. Expenses of $3.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including \nrevenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $54 \nbillion for the quarter, primarily driven by equity and fixed income. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $36 billion. AUM of $4.1 trillion and client assets of $6 trillion \nwere both up 15% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 5% year-on-year and flat quarter-on-quarter, \nand deposits were up 7% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially. Turning to Corporate on Page 8.

We continue to expect NII ex. Markets to be approximately $90 billion. The firm-wide NII outlook has\nincreased to about $94.5 billion, reflecting an increase in Markets NII, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR. Our adjusted expense outlook\ncontinues to be about $95 billion. And on Credit, we expect the card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 3.6%. So, to\nwrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance, but of course, the focus right now is on the future, which is obviously unusually\nuncertain. But no matter what outcomes eventually materialize, we are eager to do our part to continue to support our clients, the markets and the broader\neconomy, and we believe the banking system will be a source of strength in this dynamic environment.

And I'm wondering, is there anything that you've seen in the past that looks like this\nor that you would suggest if any slowdown coming forward, is it more likely to be similar to what kind of prior cycle you've seen?", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:20:15Z"}

I'm going into this because I noticed your average loan growth, I think it was running at about 2% year-on-year, and then end-of-period loans was up 5%\nand wholesale loans was up 7%. So, I'm just wondering if there was some line drawdowns at quarter-end. And it's a broader question on just liquidity, do you see\nyour customers looking for more liquidity? Are they drawing down lines? And maybe if you could speak to liquidity in the front end of the market that'd be helpful\ntoo. Thank you.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:20:15Z"}

I assume you'd pass on some of that to customers and you'd keep some of that and the regulators would save\nmoney. So, some meat on the bones about the potential concrete savings from deregulation? But before that, the negative which you highlight in the press\nrelease and the Chairman letter about the trade wars, Jamie, you went from trade wars \"get over it\" to this week say \"do something.\" So just as far as the tariff\njourney, what were you initially expecting to what happened?
