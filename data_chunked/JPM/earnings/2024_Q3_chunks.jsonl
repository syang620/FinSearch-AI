Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $12.9 billion, EPS of $4.37 and revenue of $43.3 billion with an\nROTCE of 19%. Touching on a couple of highlights. In CCB, we ranked number one in retail deposit share for the fourth straight year. In CIB, both IB fees and\nmarkets revenue were notably up year-on-year reflecting strength across the franchise. In AWM, we had record quarterly revenues and record long-term flows.\nNow turning to page two for the firm wide results. The firm reported revenue of $43.3 billion, up $2.6 billion or 6% year-on-year. NII ex-markets was up $274\nmillion or 1%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in card and higher wholesale deposit balances,\npredominantly offset by lower deposit balances in banking and wealth management and deposit margin compression. NIR ex-markets was up $1.8 billion or 17%,\nbut excluding the prior year's net investment securities losses, it was up 10% on higher asset management and investment banking fees and markets revenue\nwas up $535 million or 8% year-on-year. Expenses of $22.6 billion were up $808 million or 4% year-on-year, driven by compensation including revenue related\ncompensation and growth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense. And credit costs were $3.1 billion, reflecting net charge offs of $2.1 billion and a\nnet reserve bill of $1 billion, which included $882 million in consumer, primarily in card and $144 million in wholesale. Net charge offs were up $590 million\nyear-on-year, predominantly driven by card. On to balance sheet and capital on page three. We ended the quarter with the CET1 ratio of 15.3% flat versus the\nprior quarter as net income and OCI gains were offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter's RWA reflects higher lending activity, as well as\nhigher client activity and market moves on the trading side. We added $6 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the\ndeployment of the proceeds from the share from the sale of Visa shares as we have previously mentioned. Now let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on\npage four. CCB reported net income of $4 billion on revenue of $17.8 billion, which was down 3% year-on-year. In Banking and Wealth Management, revenue\nwas down 11% year-on-year, reflecting deposit margin compression and lower deposits partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average\ndeposits were down 8% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. We are seeing a slowdown in customer yield seeking activity including CD volumes and expect\ndeposits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year. Client investment assets were up 21% year-on-year, driven by market performance and we continue to\nsee strong referrals of new wealth management clients from our branch network. In home lending, revenue was up 3% year-on-year driven by higher NII partially\noffset by lower servicing and production revenue. Turning to Card Services and Auto. Revenue was up 11% year-on-year, driven by higher card NII on higher\nrevolving balances. Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were\n$10 billion, down 2%, while maintaining strong margins and high quality credit. Expenses of $9.6 billion were up 5% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher\nfield and technology compensation, as well as growth in marketing. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.8 billion driven by card", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:20:15Z"}

Next\nthe Commercial and Investment Bank on page five. The CIB reported net income of $5.7 billion on revenue of $17 billion. IB fees were up 31% year-on-year and\nwe ranked number one with year-to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In advisory, fees were up 10% benefiting from the closing of a few large deals. Underwriting fees\nwere up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 26%, primarily driven by favorable market conditions. In light of the positive momentum throughout the\nyear, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environment and geopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty. Payments revenue\nwas $4.4 billion, up 4% year-on-year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression. Moving to markets, total revenue\nwas $7.2 billion, up 8% year-on-year. Fixed income was flat reflecting outperformance in currencies and emerging markets and lower revenue and rates. Equities\nwas up 27%, reflecting strong performance across regions largely driven by a supportive trading environment in the U.S. and increased late quarter activity in\nAsia. Securities Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 9% year-on-year largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes. Expenses of $8.8 billion\nwere down 1% year-on-year with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenue related compensation, and growth in-place, as well as higher\ntechnology spend. Average banking and payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially. In the middle market and large corporate client\nsegments, we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients' access to receptive capital markets. In multifamily,\nwhile we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain muted in the near-term as originations are\noffset by payoff activity. Average client deposits were up 7% year-on-year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in payments and\nsecurity services. Finally, credit costs were $316 million, driven by higher net lending activity, including in markets and downgrades, partially offset by improved\nmacroeconomic variables. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page six. Asset and wealth management reported net income of $1.4 billion with\npre-tax margin of 33%. For the quarter, revenue of $5.4 billion was up 9% year-on-year, driven by growth and management fees on higher average market levels\nand strong net inflows, investment valuation gains, compared to losses in the prior year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by deposit margin\ncompression. Expenses of $3.6 billion or up 16% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and\ncontinued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense. For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $72\nbillion, led by fixed income inequ", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:20:15Z"}

For the quarter, long-term net inflows were $72\nbillion, led by fixed income inequities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $34 billion. AUM of $3.9 trillion and client assets of $5.7 trillion were both up 23%,\ndriven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter-on-quarter. Turning\nto corporate on page seven. Corporate reported net income of $1.8 billion. Revenue was $3.1 billion, up $1.5 billion year-on-year. NII was $2.9 billion, up $932\nmillion year-on-year, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, including from prior quarters. NIR was a net gain of\n$155 million, compared with a net loss of $425 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter. Expenses of\n$589 million were down $107 million year-on-year. To finish up, let's turn to the outlook on page eight. We now expect 2024 NII ex-markets to be approximately\n$91.5 billion and total NII to be approximately $92.5 billion. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91.5 billion. And given where we are in the year, we\nincluded on the page the implied fourth quarter guidance for NII and adjusted expense. And note that the NII numbers imply about $800 million of markets NII in\nthe fourth quarter. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.4%. So to wrap up, we're pleased with another\nquarter of strong operating performance. As we look ahead to the next few quarters, we expect results will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues.\nBut we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue delivering excellent returns through the cycle. And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:20:15Z"}

The\nsecond being inspired by what Jamie just said number one, you know, NII is expected to be down 6% sequentially in fourth quarter. I think year-over-year in \u201825,\nconsensus has it down 4% from your new level. So it sounds like consensus still has room to come down and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it could be a\nlittle bit worse year-over-year than the fourth quarter sequential rate. But that being said, as Jamie noted, like we have no idea what the curve is going to look like,\nright? I mean, it's gyrated so much.

So do you think in some way,\nwhen you think about the value, your price and your ability to do buybacks, you're thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a\nnew school model that might put you in the category more tech-oriented firms, especially as it relates to your progress with AI?", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:20:15Z"}
