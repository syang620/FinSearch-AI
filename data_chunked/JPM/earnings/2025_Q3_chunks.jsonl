Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. The presentation is available\non JPMorgan Chase's website. Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please standby. At this time, I would now like to\nturn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. Thank you and good morning everyone. Let me begin by noting that this quarter we are experimenting with shorter prepared remarks. We are streamlining this\npart of the call to move more quickly to your questions to minimize the amount of time spent on repeating what you have already seen in the earnings materials.\nSo with that, turning to this quarter's results, the firm reported net income of $14.4 billion and EPS of $5.07 and an ROTCE of 20%. Revenue of $47.1 billion was\nup 9% year on year, predominantly driven by higher markets revenue as well as higher fees across asset management, investment banking, and payment. The\nincrease in NII driven by the impact of balance sheet growth and mix was offset by the impact of lower rates. Expenses of $24.3 billion were up 8% year on year\ndriven by similar themes as in prior quarters, including higher volume and revenue-related expense. The detailed drivers are in the presentation. And credit costs\nwere $3.4 billion with net charge-offs of $2.6 billion and a net reserve build of $810 million. In wholesale, charge-offs were slightly elevated as a result of a couple\nof instances of apparent fraud in certain secured lending facilities. Otherwise, in both wholesale and consumer, credit performance remains in line with our\nexpectations. And in terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 14.8%, down 30 basis points versus the prior quarter. You can see the\nputs and takes in the presentation. This quarter's higher RWA is primarily driven by increased wholesale lending across both banking and markets as well as\nother markets activities. Moving to our businesses, CCB reported net income of $5 billion. Revenue of $19.5 billion was up 9% year on year predominantly driven\nby higher NII largely incurred on higher revolving balances. A few points to highlight. Consumers and small businesses remain resilient based on our data. While\nwe are closely watching the potentially softening labor market, our credit metrics including early-stage delinquencies remain stable and slightly better than\nexpected. We retained our number one position in retail deposit share in a relatively flat deposit market based on FDIC data, marking our fifth consecutive year of\nleading the industry. And in light of the attention our Sapphire refresh has received, we want to note that this has already been the best year ever for new account\nacquisitions for our Sapphire portfolio. Next, the CIB reported net income of $6.9 billion. Revenue of $19.9 billion was up 17% year on year driven by higher revenues across markets, payments,\ninvestment banking, and security. To give a bit more color, IB fees were up 16% year on year reflecting a pickup in activity across products with particular\nstrength in equity underwriting as the IPO market was active. Our pipeline remains robust and the outlook along with the market backdrop and client sentiment\ncontinues to be upbeat. In markets, fixed income was up 21% year on year with higher revenues in rates and credit as well as strong performance in securitized\nproducts. Equities were up 33%, from robust client activity across the franchise with notable outperformance in Prime. Turning to Asset and Wealth Management,\nAWM reported net income of $1.7 billion with a pretax margin of 36%. Record revenue", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:20:15Z"}

Turning to Asset and Wealth Management,\nAWM reported net income of $1.7 billion with a pretax margin of 36%. Record revenue of $6.1 billion was up 12% year on year predominantly driven by growth in\nmanagement fees due to long net inflows and higher average market levels as well as higher brokerage activity. Long-term net inflows were $72 billion for the\nquarter led by fixed income and equities. AUM of $4.6 trillion was up 18% year on year and client assets of $6.8 trillion up 20% year on year, driven by continued\nnet inflows and higher market levels. And before turning to the outlook, corporate reported net income of $820 million and revenue of $1.7 billion. In terms of the\noutlook, since we have already reported three quarters of results I am going to update the full year guidance in terms of the fourth quarter. And in addition to that,\nwe have done the implied full year math on the page, you can easily compare it to previous guidance. We expect fourth quarter NII ex markets to be\napproximately $23.5 billion and fourth quarter total NII to be about $25 billion. We expect fourth quarter adjusted expense to be approximately $24.5 billion\nimplying $95.9 billion for the full year with the increase driven by the stronger revenue environment. And on credit, we now expect the 2025 card net charge-off rates to be approximately 3.3% on favorable delinquency trends driven by the continued resilience of\nthe consumer. In keeping with our focus on the fourth quarter and recognizing that you will likely annualize the fourth quarter NII and ask us questions about\n2026, we are providing the central case for NII ex markets in 2026 which is about $95 billion. Note that this is a preliminary view subject to the usual caveats as\nwell as the fact that we have not finished the annual budget cycle yet. And for expenses, completing the budget cycle will be even more important is why we are\nnot providing an update today. While you probably have not spent a lot of time refining your 2026 estimates yet, it is worth saying that when we look at the fourth\nquarter and adjust for seasonality, and expected labor inflation as well as adding some growth, the consensus of about $100 billion does look a little bit low. We\nwill formally provide the 2026 outlook for NII in expense and card MCO rate at fourth quarter earnings and we will have another opportunity to discuss the outlook\nat our recently announced company update in February. We are now happy to take your questions, so let us open the line for Q and A.\nOperator\nThank you. Please standby. Our first question comes from John McDonald with Truist Securities. You may proceed.\nJohn McDonald\nThank you. Good morning. Thanks for the initial outlook on the 2026 NII. Jeremy, wanted to ask about the retail deposit assumptions that were embedded in that.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:20:15Z"}

Could you give us a sense as to how you are thinking\nabout the reserve that you have against the commercial book, especially given what you just mentioned? Around the mix of the portfolio is different today than it\nwas prior cycle? I am thinking prior cycle means pre-COVID, but let me know if it is a different timeframe that you are thinking Well, I mean, think we were thinking\nof the entire post-GFC era. I think a couple of Investor Days ago, we put up a slide showing that wholesale charge-off rate over ten years. Might be wrong, but\nfrom memory, was like zero on a net basis, which is obviously not reasonable going forward. But on your narrow question about the reserve, I think you have\nactually in that a little bit, I mean, maybe it pop in the consolidated numbers. But in some of the recent quarters, as we have sort of started doing some more of\nthese direct lending deals, When we put those deals on the books, they come with quite significant day one reserve balances. So in the normal course, that\ngrowth comes with healthy reserves. And hopefully, we get the underwriting right and we got all that money back obviously. So, but as you well know, our entire\nwholesale reserve methodology is highly granular and very specific. And so it to the extent that the mix shifts, loan growth will come with slightly higher reserve\nand intensity, but that will be situation by situation.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:20:15Z"}

Jeremy, obviously you guys are in the residential mortgage lending big players granted home lending when you look at the revenue to\nbanking and wealth management obviously, it is not that big. But I got a question for you. This administration seems to be, when they come out with comments,\nthey follow-up on those comments with actions. And Secretary of the Treasury, Bessen, has pointed out about a couple of months ago, that he thinks is a housing\nemergency in this country. And so the question for you guys is what do you think they could do to lower the spread between mortgage rates and the\ncorresponding treasury yield assuming the treasury yields do not go down. But what do you what do you think they can actively do to lower that spread to lower\nmortgage rates to get housing more active and refinancing activity of course would pick up with that? So I will take that one. First on the supply side, I mean it is we know what it is. It is permitting, it is rules, it is local rules, it is how long it takes to get permits and\nbuild not in my backyard, you cannot build two stories in certain places. That is the supply side. The demand side and remember, do not always push\nhomeownership. That was we made a huge mistake that the government policy years ago. But the supply side, we pointed out over and over and over again. I\nhave been talking about it for 30 to 40 basis points overall. Would that create any additional risk? There is just excessive stuff put in place after great financial\ncrisis, which obviously demanded a response, but it is excessive. Anyone who take it on a mortgage will tell you they had to sign 17 forms, 17 documents and all\nthese things. So that is to me the most obvious one. And obviously, policy, if you the government wants to do more FHA or they could do that. That is up to them\nabout whether they want cheapen mortgages for near prime or all stuff like that.
