Thank you guys for taking the question, and congratulations on a fantastic quarter in what all of us are looking at as a difficult environment, a lot of\nuncertainty out there, so really impressive to put up the results that you guys did. One of the things that we heard a lot about this quarter in the media and press\nreports was changing data center commitments, maybe Microsoft walking away from some of those data center commitments. But it sounds like the AI demand is\nvery strong. You\u2019re talking about not being able to hit all that demand with supply. Can you talk to us about what\u2019s going on with your datacenter strategy? Are\nthere any shifts taking place? And maybe in particular, Satya, you could talk about some of the comments that you had made about the potential risk for\noversupplies and GPUs out in the future. What exactly was that risk you were talking about? And are you incorporating that risk into your datacenter strategy? Yeah. First of all, thanks, Keith, for the questions. The reality is, we\u2019ve always been making adjustments to build, lease, what pace we build, all through the last\n10-15 years. It\u2019s just that you all pay a lot more attention to what we do quarter over quarter nowadays. Having said that, the key thing for us is to have our builds\nand lease be positioned for what is the workload growth of the future. That\u2019s what you have to go and seek to. There\u2019s a demand part to it. There is the shape of\nthe workload part to it, and there is a location part to it. You don\u2019t want to be upside-down on having one big data center in one region, when you have a global\ndemand footprint. You don\u2019t want to be upside-down when the shape of demand changes, because, after all, with essentially pre-training plus test time compute,\nthat\u2019s a big change in terms of how you think about even what is training. Forget inferencing. Fundamentally, given all of that, and then every time there\u2019s great\nMoore\u2019s Law, but remember, this is a compounding S-curve, which is, there\u2019s Moore\u2019s Law, there\u2019s system software, there\u2019s model architecture changes, there\u2019s\nthe app server efficiency. Given all of that, we just want to make sure we\u2019re building, accounting for the latest and greatest information we have on all of that. And\nthat\u2019s what you see reflected, and I feel very, very good about the pace. In fact, Amy just mentioned, we will be short power. And so, therefore, but it\u2019s not power.\nIt\u2019s not a blanket statement. I need power in specific places so that we can either lease or build at the pace at which we want. And so, that\u2019s the plan that we\u2019re\nexecuting. Maybe, Amy, you can add to that.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:19Z"}

Satya, on your comment about accelerating demand for cloud migrations, I\u2019m curious if you could dig in and extrapolate a little more what you\u2019re seeing\nthere. Thank you. Thanks, Brent. Yeah, I sort of think about three big things that are happening in the cloud, all at parallel, and there is also a relationship between them. One is, I\u2019ll \njust say, the classic migration of whether it\u2019s SQL, Windows Server. And so, that\u2019s, again, got good steady state progress, because the reality is, I think \neveryone\u2019s now, perhaps there\u2019s another kick in the datacenter migrations, just because of the efficiency the cloud provides. That\u2019s one part. The second piece is \ngood data growth. You saw Postgres on Azure. I mean, forgetting SQL Server, Postgres on Azure is growing. Cosmos is growing, the analytic stuff I talked about \nwith Fabric. It\u2019s even the others, whether it is Databricks or even Snowflake on Azure are growing. We feel very good about Fabric growth and our data growth. \nThen the cloud-native growth, this is, again, before we even get to AI, some of the core compute consumption of cloud-native players is also very healthy. It was \nhealthy throughout the quarter. We projected to go moving forward as well. Then the thing to notice is the ratio, and I think we\u2019ve mentioned this multiple times \nbefore. If you look underneath even ChatGPT, in fact, that team does a fantastic job of thinking about not only their growth in terms of AI accelerators they need. \nThey use Cosmos DB. They use Postgres. They use core compute and storage. And so, there\u2019s even a ratio between any AI workload in terms of AI accelerator \nto others. Those are the four pockets, I would say, or four different trend lines, which all have a relationship with each other. And if I step back, and Amy and I talk \na lot about this, this time around, there\u2019s nothing certain for sure in the future, except for one thing, which is our largest business is our infrastructure business. \nAnd the good news here is the next big platform shift builds on that. It\u2019s not a complete rebuild, having gone through some of these platform shift, where you have \nto come out on the other side with a full rebuild. If there is good news here, it\u2019s that we have a good business in Azure that continues to grow, and the new\n\nplatform depends on that. We want to stay disciplined and execute super well on that.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:19Z"}

Congratulations on the great quarter. Satya and Amy, Microsoft is a\nvery different business than it was during the last recession. Incredible job you\u2019ve done. If we get into a recession, and I hope we don\u2019t, how do you think about\nthe stability, the sustainability, revenue volatility of Microsoft today, if we were to get into recession? Would the business react early to recession or late? Would a\nrecession have a more shallow impact on revenue? Any thoughts would be appreciated. Maybe I\u2019ll start and then Amy should add, Mark. The way, at least, I think we will approach it is, quite frankly, be very focused on how we help our customers if\nthere is any turbulence in the macro, because one of the things that we feel we can do, just because of the efficiencies of the cloud, and the footprint we have and\nthe differentiated layers of the stack, from the SaaS application side to the infrastructure side, I think if you buy into the argument that software is the most\nmalleable resource we have to fight any type of inflationary pressure or any type of growth pressure where you need to do more with less, I think we can be super\nhelpful in that. And so, if anything, we would probably have more of that mindset is how do we make sure we are helping our customers?

One question for Amy. You\u2019ve said in the past that you can attain better and better capital efficiency with the Cloud business, and\nprobably Cloud and AI business.

Can we get a market to market on that? Thank you. Yeah, I mean, I think at a macro level, I think the way to think about this is, you can ask the question, what\u2019s the difference between a hosting business and a\nhyperscale business? It\u2019s software. That\u2019s, I think, the gist of it. Yes, for sure, it\u2019s a capital intensive business, but capital efficiency comes from that system wide\nsoftware optimization.

Satya, you had commented recently that the DeepSeek moment is a real thing, and you had said that software efficiencies mean that the\nfleet will be aged for a longer time. Can you comment on how those advances are affecting the pace and volume of AI experimentation and activity in the\nmarketplace? And Amy, could we start to consider the possibility that software enhancements might extend the useful life assumption that you\u2019re using for GPUs,\nor is it a little premature to be thinking that way? Yeah. First of all, I think some of the work that actually, OpenAI first pioneered and did with all of the reasoning models, and of course, DeepSeek has added to it\nand done good work as well, and others as well, the idea that you can have test time compute plus pre-training, and then some of the great optimization at\ninference time that has all happened has proven out. I mean, if you look at it, I would say for every Moore\u2019s Law change and movement, there\u2019s probably a 10x\nimprovement because of software. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening with these models. Some of it comes from model architecture. Some of that comes from data\nefficiency, compute efficiency, and what have you. That\u2019s what we are riding, and we feel that, all up, when you have a commodity that is getting that better, then\nthe question is, how do you build out a fleet that\u2019s super balanced, so that then the workloads can be built and can, in fact, take advantage of that efficiency at the\nunderlying infrastructure? I mean, it\u2019s kind of like virtualization. What is the difference between servers and, again, client server with virtualization? It was\nefficiency. What is the difference between virtualization and cloud? It was efficiency. What is the difference between this generation of cloud and AI? It\u2019s\nefficiency. The more you can kind of continue to think about software driving that efficiency is what drives demand, ultimately.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:19Z"}
