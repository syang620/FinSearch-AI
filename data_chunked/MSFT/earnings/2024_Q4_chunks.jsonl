Thank you, guys for taking the question and congratulations on another great quarter and really solid overall fiscal year. Right now, there's a industry\ndebate raging around the CapEx requirements around Generative AI and whether the monetization is actually going to match with that. And I think the question\nfor you guys, from a Microsoft perspective, is CapEx still an appropriate leading indicator for cloud growth? Or does the shift in gross margin profile change that\nequation? Or said another way, maybe can you give us a little bit more help in understanding the timing between the CapEx investments and the yield on those\ninvestments? Thank you. Thank you, Keith. Let me start, and then Amy can add to this. I think, I would say we primarily start right now from the demand side. What I mean by that is what's\nthe product \u2013 shape of the product portfolio, what we learned even from the cloud transition, which, as you know, Keith, was similar in the sense it was both a\nknowledge-intensive and a capital-intensive transition. We needed to have the product portfolio where there was the right mix of, I'll call it, infrastructure meters as\nwell as SaaS applications. So that's the first thing that we are looking at. And how is that value landing with customers and what's the growth rate. So when I think\nabout what's happening with M365 Copilot as perhaps the best Office 365 or M365 suite we have had, the fact that we're getting recurring customers, so our\ncustomers coming back buying more seats. So GitHub Copilot now being bigger than even GitHub when we bought it. What's happening in the contact center\nwith Dynamics. So I would say \u2013 and obviously, the Azure AI growth, that's the first place we look at. That then drives bulk of the CapEx spend, basically, that's\nthe demand signal because you got to remember, even in the capital spend, there is land and there is data center build, but 60-plus percent is the kit, that only\nwill be bought for inferencing and everything else if there is demand signal, right? So that's, I think, the key way to think about capital cycle even. The asset, as\nAmy said, is a long-term asset, which is land and the data center, which, by the way, we don't even construct things fully, we can even have things which are\nsemi-constructed, we call [cold] (ph) shelves and so on. So we know how to manage our CapEx spend to build out a long-term asset and a lot of the hydration of\nthe kit happens when we have the demand signal. There is definitely spend for training. Even there, of course, we will only be scaling training as we see the\ndemand accrue in any given period in time. So I would say it's more important to manage, to capture the opportunity with the right product portfolio that's driving\nvalue. And on that front, I feel good about the breadth of Microsoft offering, whether it's in consumer side, whether it's on commercial per seat side or on the\nconsumption meters, that's, I think, the fundamental driver.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:19Z"}

Thank you for taking the question. And congrats on a strong year. GenAI has been a bit of rollercoaster of a tech over the last year with\nperiods of acceleration, high expectations and the expectations drop as reality kicked in. With Azure growth we've seen this quarter and O365 Commercial, not\nyet fully visible in numbers even though Amy, you gave us a lot of color on it. Two quick parts to the question. Satya, how should we think about what it's going to\ntake for GenAI to become more real across the industry and for it to become more visible within your SaaS offerings? And Amy, with Cloud, it took time for\nmargins to improve. It looks like with AI, it's happening quicker. Can you give us a sense of how you think about the margin impact near-term and long-term from\nall the investment on AI? Thank you. Yes. Thanks again, Mark, for the question. So to me, look, at the end of the day, GenAI is just software. So it is really translating into fundamentally growth on\nwhat has been our M365 SaaS offering with a newer offering that is the Copilot SaaS offering, which today is on a growth rate that's faster than any other\nprevious generation of software we launched as a suite in M365. That's, I think, the best way to describe it. I mean the numbers I think we shared even this\nquarter are indicative of this, Mark. So if you look at it, we have both the landing of the seats itself quarter-over-quarter that is growing 60%, right? That's a pretty\ngood healthy sign. The most healthy sign for me is the fact that customers are coming back there. That is the same customers with whom we landed the seats\ncoming back and buying more seats. And then the number of customers with 10,000-plus seats doubled, right? It's 2x quarter-over-quarter. That, to me, is a\nhealthy SaaS core business. And on top of that, some of the things that Amy shared around Dynamic. That's another exciting place for us, which is one, we are\ngaining share. We are \u2013 Dynamics with the GenAI built-in is sort of really biz app, it's probably the category that gets completely transformed with GenAI. Contact\ncenters being a great example. We ourselves are on course to save hundreds of millions of dollars in our own customer support and contact center operations. I\nthink we can drive that value to our customers. And then on the Azure side, you see the numbers very clearly. In fact, I think last quarter is when we started giving\nyou that. You saw an acceleration of that this quarter. One of the other pieces, Mark, is AI doesn't sit on its own, right? So it's just for \u2013 we have a concept of\ndesign wins in Azure. So in fact, 50% of the folks who are using Azure AI are also using a data meter. That's very exciting to us because the most important thing\nin Azure is to win workloads in the enterprise. And that is starting to happen. And these are generational things once they get going with you. So that's, I think,\nhow we think about it at least when I look at what's happening on our demand side.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:19Z"}

With a couple of quarters of Copilot for M365 availability under your belt now, how are you assessing the capability of Copilots to replicate\nthe productivity gains that they've created for developers, which seem to be very high and to do something similar for the broader population of knowledge\nworkers? For instance, you're mentioning the 10,000 feet deals, the repeat purchases, is it possible to eventually see Copilot penetration rate equally high in\noffice as they will be in GitHub? Yes, that's a great question. In fact, the GitHub design system and the GitHub Copilot workspace design system, which now, for example, you start with an issue,\nyou create a plan, from a plan, you create a spec, or you create a spec and from a spec, you create a plan and then you go operate across the full repo. That's\neffectively the design system that is getting replicated inside of even the M365 Copilot. And you see this even now \u2013 for example, you get an email, you're in\nsales, you want to respond to the customer. The data from the email is essentially context for a prompt but you expand by bringing in all of your CRM data, right?\nSo this customer email is in the context of some order, all of the CRM record gets completed in context and a reply gets generated with the CRM data. That's the\ntype of stuff that's already happening. Then you take something like Copilot Studio, you can start even grounding it in more data and then completing workflows.\nSo you could say if this email comes from this customer whose order date is got a particular issue with it. You can then go and escalate it to somebody else who\ngets a notification in Teams. And those are the kinds of workflows that are getting built within IT or by end users themselves, what used to be line of business\napplications to us are Copilot extensions going forward. So we think of this as really a new design system for knowledge and frontline work to drive productivity,\nwhich would be very akin to what has happened in software engineering. So when you think about marketing or finance or sales or customer service, we will\neffectively replicate what you just said, which is the type of productivity we've seen in developers, will come to all of these functions as they think about their work,\nworkflow and workout effect, all being driven by Copilots.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:19Z"}

You've made significant investments, including the Activision deal. But how should investors be thinking about the growth potential of the gaming? Or what\nare the puts and takes to help make considerations here? Thank you. Yes. For us, our investment in gaming fundamentally was to have, I would say, the right portfolio of both what we love about gaming and always have loved about \ngaming, which is Xbox and the content for the console and expand from there so that we have content for everywhere people play games, starting with the PC. \nSo when I think about the Activision portfolio, it comes with great assets for us to cover both the PC and the console. And then, of course, assets to cover mobile \nsockets, which we never have. So we feel that now we have both the content and the ability to access all the traditional high scale platforms where people play\n\ngames, which is the console, PC and mobile. But we're also excited about these new sockets, right? I mean the fact that even in this last quarter, we expanded X\nCloud to Amazon TV, I forget the name of what it's called. But that's the type of new access that really helps us a lot, get reach new gamers or the same gamer\neverywhere they want to play.
