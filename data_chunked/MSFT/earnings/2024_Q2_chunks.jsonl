Amy, you've discussed Azure being stable and you\ndeliver Azure growth stability, but if we drill in one layer, we see Azure AI [aiming] (ph) to become a bigger portion of the revenue. I understand that separating\nwhat is directly AI revenue versus other IaaS, PaaS revenue that are leveraging well driven by AI is difficult, can you help me with two related questions?\nOptimization has been stabilizing and at some point, it should be part of the revenue flow. How should we think about what happens then, do we see non-directly\nAI consumption being flattish or do we see a rebound as the cloud shift continues and the need for data of inferencing grows? Second point. On AI, where are we\nin the journey from training driving most of Azure AI usage to inferencing? When do you think we start to see pick-up in non-Microsoft inferencing kick in, when do\nyou think we could hit the point where inferencing is the bigger part of the driver? Thank you. You want me to go first and...", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:19Z"}

A superb quarter of great improvements. Just one question for you Satya. Cloud computing changed the tech stack in ways that we\ncould not imagine 10 years back, the nature of the database layer, the operating system layer, every layer just changed dramatically. How do you foresee\ngenerative AI changing the tech stack as we know it? Thank you so much. Yes, I think it's going to have a very foundational impact. In fact, you could say the core compute architecture itself changes, everything from power, power\ndensity to the data center design, to what used to be the accelerator, now is the sort of the main CPU, so to speak, or the main compute unit. And so, I think in the\nnetwork, the memory architecture, all of it. So as the core computer architecture changes, I think every workload changes. And so yes, so there is a full, like, take\nour data layer, the most exciting thing for me in the last year has been to see how our data layer has evolved to be built for AI, right? If you think about Fabric, one\nof the genius of Fabric is to be able to say, let's separate out storage from the compute layer. In compute we'll have traditional SQL, we\u2019ll have Spark. And by the\nway, you can have an Azure AI job on top of the same data lake, so to speak, or the lakehouse pattern. And then the business model you can combine all of\nthose different compute. So that's the type of compute architecture. So it's sort of a -- so that's just one example. The tool stuff is changing. Office, I mean if you\nthink about what -- if I look at Copilot; Copilots extensibility with GPT, Copilot apps to the Copilot stack, that's another sort of part of what's happening to the tech\nstack. So yes, I mean, definitely builds. I mean. I do believe, being in the cloud has been very helpful to build AI. But now, AI is just redefining what it means to\nhave, what the cloud looks like, both at the infrastructure level and the app model.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:19Z"}

The early market feedback that we're all hearing on Microsoft 365 copilot is very powerful. Can you provide\nmore granularity on what you're seeing in terms of adoption trends versus perhaps other new product introductions in the past, what if anything is holding it back,\nand how much of a priority is it to get it in the hands of customers? To what lengths might you go to incentivize just getting it out in the market? Thank you. No, thank you for the question, Brad. So, a couple of things. In my comments I said increase in relation to our previous suites like, let's say, E3 or E5. Whatever\ntwo months in, it's definitely much faster than that. And so, from that perspective. It's exciting to see, I\u2019d say, the demand signal, the deployment signal. I was\nlooking at by tenant, even usage, it's faster than anything else because it's easier, right. I mean, it's sort of -- it shows up in your app, if you click on it, like any\nribbon thing and it becomes a daily habit. So it in fact, it reminds me a little bit of sort of the back-in-the day of PC adoption, right. It's kind of -- I think it first starts\noff with few people having access. There are many companies that are doing standard issue, right. So just like PCs became standard issue at some point after\nPCs being adopted by early adopters. I think that's the cycle that at least we expect. In terms of what we're seeing, it's actually interesting, If you look at the data\nwe have, summarization, that's what it's like number-one, like I'm doing summarization of Teams meetings inside of Teams, during the meeting, after the meeting,\nword documents summarization, I get something in email on summarizing. So summarization has become a big deal. Drafts, right, you're drafting emails, drafting\ndocuments. So, anytime you want to start something, the blank page thing goes away and you start by prompting and drafting. Chat, to me, the most powerful\nfeature is now you have the most important database in your company, which happens to be the database of your documents and communications. It is now\nqueryable by natural language in a powerful way, right. I can go and say, what are all the things Amy said, I should be watching out for next quarter and it will\ncome out with great detail. And so Chat, summarization, draft, also by the way, actions. One of the most used thing is, here's the Word document, go complete, I\nmean, create a PowerPoint for me. So, those are the stuff that is also beginning. So, I feel like these all become -- but fundamentally, what happens is, if you\nremember the PC adoption cycle, what it did was work artifact and work flow changed, right. You can imagine what forecasting was before excel and email and\nwhat it was after. So similarly, you'll see work and workflow change as people summarize faster, draft regulatory submissions faster. Chat to get knowledge from\nyour business. And so, those are the things that we are seeing as overall patterns.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:15:19Z"}
