My name is Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined\ntoday by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja and a number of other executives. Our Q2 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time, and the update deck\nwe published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are\nbased on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those\nmentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. [Operator Instructions] Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\nElon R. Musk\nThanks, Travis. So we've had a very exciting quarter. We were able to successfully launch robotaxi, so providing our first drives with no one in the driver seat with\npaying customers in Austin. And as some may have noted, we've already expanded our service area in Austin. It's bigger and longer. And it's going to get even\nbigger and longer. We were expecting to really greatly increase the Austin service area to well in excess of what competitors are doing. And that's hopefully in a\nweek or so, 2 weeks?", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:13:22Z"}
