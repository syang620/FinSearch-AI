Thank you so much for taking the question and congratulations on the really strong results. My question is for Jen-Hsun on the data center business. Clearly, \nyou're doing extremely well in the business. I'm curious how your expectations for calendar '24 and '25 have evolved over the past 90 days. And as you answer\n\nthe question, I was hoping you can touch on some of the newer buckets within data center, things like software. Sovereign AI, I think you've been pretty vocal\nabout how to think about that medium-to-long term. And recently, there was an article about NVIDIA potentially participating in the ASIC market. Is there any\ncredence to that, and if so, how should we think about you guys playing in that market over the next several years? Thank you.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:18:28Z"}

Congrats on the results. I wanted to ask I guess a two-part question, and it comes at what Stacy was just getting out on your\ndemand being significantly more than your supply, even though supply is improving. And I guess the two sides of the question are, I guess, first for Colette, like\nhow are you guys thinking about allocation of product in terms of customer readiness to deploy and sort of monitoring if there's any kind of build-up of product that\nmight not yet be turned on? And then I guess Jen-Hsun, for you, I'd be really interested to hear you speak a bit about the thought that you and your company are\nputting into the allocation of your product across customers, many of which compete with each other, across industries to smaller startup companies, to things in\nthe healthcare arena to government. It's a very, very unique technology that you're enabling and I'd be really interested to hear you speak a bit about how you\nthink about quote/unquote fairly allocating sort of for the good of your company, but also for the good of the industry. Thanks. Let me first start with your question, thanks, about how we are working with our customers as they look into how they are building out their GPU instances and\nour allocation process. The folks that we work with, our customers that we work with, have been partners with us for many years as we have been assisting them\nboth in what they set up in the cloud, as well as what they are setting up internally. Many of these providers have multiple products going at one time to serve so\nmany different needs across their end customers but also what they need internally. So they are working in advance, of course, thinking about those new clusters\nthat they will need. And our discussions with them continue not only on our Hopper architecture, but helping them understand the next wave and getting their\ninterest and getting their outlook for the demand that they want. So it's always a moving process in terms of what they will purchase, what is still being built and\nwhat is in use for our end customers. But the relationships that we've built and their understanding of the sophistication of the build has really helped us with that\nallocation and both helped us with our communications with them.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:18:28Z"}

I wanted to ask about how you're converting backlog into revenue. Obviously, lead times for your products have come down quite a bit. Colette, you\ndidn't talk about the inventory purchase commitments. But if I sort of add up your inventory plus the purchase commits and your prepaid supply, sort of the\naggregate of your supply, it was actually down a touch. How should we read that? Is that just you saying that you don't need to make as much of a financial\ncommitment to your suppliers because the lead times are lower or is that maybe you're reaching some sort of steady state where you're closer to filling your order\nbook and your backlog? Thanks. Yeah. So let me, highlight on those three different areas of how we look at our suppliers. You're correct. Our inventory on hand given our allocation that we're on,\nwe're trying to, as things come into inventory, immediately work to ship them to our customers. I think our customer appreciates our ability to meet the schedules\nthat we've looked for. The second piece of it is our purchase commitments. Our purchase commitments have many different components into it, components that\nwe need for manufacturing. But also, often we are procuring capacity that we may need. The length of that need for capacity or the length for the components are\nall different. Some of them may be for the next two quarters, but some of them may be for multiple years. I can say the same regarding our prepaids. Our\nprepaids are pre-designed to make sure that we have the reserve capacity that we need at several of our manufacturing suppliers as we look forward. So\nwouldn't read into anything regarding approximately about the same numbers as we are increasing our supply. All of them just have different lengths as we have\nsometimes had to buy things in long-lead times or things that needed capacity to be built for us.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research. Your line is open.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:18:28Z"}
