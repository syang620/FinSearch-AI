Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Obviously, remarkable results. Jensen, I wanted to ask a question of you regarding the really quickly emerging \napplication of large model inference. So I think it's pretty well understood by the majority of investors that you guys have very much a lockdown share of the \ntraining market. A lot of the smaller market -- smaller model inference workloads have been done on ASICs or CPUs in the past. And with many of these GPT and \nother really large models, there's this new workload that's accelerating super-duper quickly on large model inference. And I think your Grace Hopper Superchip \nproducts and others are pretty well aligned for that. But could you maybe talk to us about how you're seeing the inference market segment between small model\n\ninference and large model inference and how your product portfolio is positioned for that? Thanks. So thanks for that question regarding our supply. Yes, we do expect to continue increasing ramping our supply over the next quarters as well as into next fiscal\nyear. In terms of percent, it's not something that we have here. It is a work across so many different suppliers, so many different parts of building an HGX and\nmany of our other new products that are coming to market. But we are very pleased with both the support that we have with our suppliers and the long time that\nwe have spent with them improving their supply.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:18:28Z"}

Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, Colette, if you could tell me like how much of Data Center in the quarter, maybe even the guide is like\nsystems versus GPU, like DGX versus just the H100? What I'm really trying to get at is, how much is like pricing or content or however you want to define that\n[indiscernible] versus units actually driving the growth going forward. Can you give us any color around that? Sure, Stacy. Let me help. Within the quarter, our HGX systems were a very significant part of our Data Center as well as our Data Center growth that we had\nseen. Those systems include our HGX of our Hopper architecture, but also our Ampere architecture. Yes, we are still selling both of these architectures in the\nmarket. Now when you think about that, what does that mean from both the systems as a unit, of course, is growing quite substantially, and that is driving in terms\nof the revenue increases. So both of these things are the drivers of the revenue inside Data Center. Our DGXs are always a portion of additional systems that we\nwill sell. Those are great opportunities for enterprise customers and many other different types of customers that we're seeing even in our consumer Internet\ncompanies. The importance there is also coming together with software that we sell with our DGXs, but that's a portion of our sales that we're doing. The rest of\nthe GPUs, we have new GPUs coming to market that we talk about the L40S, and they will add continued growth going forward. But again, the largest driver of\nour revenue within this last quarter was definitely the HGX system.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:18:28Z"}

Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the success. Jensen, it seems like a key part of the success -- your success in the market is delivering the\nsoftware ecosystem along with the chip and the hardware platform. And I had a two-part question on this. I was wondering if you could just help us understand\nthe evolution of your software ecosystem, the critical elements. And is there a way to quantify your lead on this dimension like how many person years you've\ninvested in building it? And then part two, I was wondering if you would care to share with us your view on the -- what percentage of the value of the NVIDIA\nplatform is hardware differentiation versus software differentiation? Thank you.\nA \u2013 Jensen Huang\nYeah, Mark, I really appreciate the question. Let me see if I could use some metrics, so we have a run time called AI Enterprise. This is one part of our software\nstack. And this is, if you will, the run time that just about every company uses for the end-to-end of machine learning from data processing, the training of any\nmodel that you like to do on any framework you'd like to do, the inference and the deployment, the scaling it out into a data center. It could be a scale-out for a\nhyperscale data center. It could be a scale-out for enterprise data center, for example, on VMware. You can do this on any of our GPUs. We have hundreds of\nmillions of GPUs in the field and millions of GPUs in the cloud and just about every single cloud. And it runs in a single GPU configuration as well as multi-GPU\nper compute or multi-node. It also has multiple sessions or multiple computing instances per GPU. So from multiple instances per GPU to multiple GPUs, multiple\nnodes to entire data center scale. So this run time called NVIDIA AI enterprise has something like 4,500 software packages, software libraries and has something\nlike 10,000 dependencies among each other. And that run time is, as I mentioned, continuously updated and optimized for our installed base for our stack. And\nthat's just one example of what it would take to get accelerated computing to work. The number of code combinations and type of application combinations is\nreally quite insane. And it's taken us two decades to get here. But what I would characterize as probably our -- the elements of our company, if you will, are\nseveral. I would say number 1 is architecture. The flexibility, the versatility and the performance of our architecture makes it possible for us to do all the things that\nI just said, from data processing to training to inference, for preprocessing of the data before you do the inference to the post processing of the data, tokenizing of\nlanguages so that you could then train with it. The amount of -- the workflow is much more intense than just training or inference. But anyways, that's where we'll\nfocus and it's fine. But when people actually use these computing systems, it's quite -- requires a lot of applications. And so the combination of our architecture\nmakes it possible for us to deliver the lowest cost ownership. And the reason for that is because we accelerate so many different things. The second\ncharacteristic of our company is the installed base. You have to ask yourself, why is it that all the software developers come to our platform? And the reason for\nthat is because software developers seek a large installed base so that they can reach the largest number of end users, so that they could build a business or get\na return on the investments that they make. And then the third characteristic is reach. We're in the cloud today, both for public cloud, public-facing cloud because\nwe have so many customers that use -- so many developers and customers that use our platform. CSPs are delighted to put it up in the cloud. They use it for\ninternal consumption", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:18:28Z"}

They use it for\ninternal consumption to develop and train and to operate recommender systems or search or data processing engines and whatnot all the way to training and\ninference. And so we're in the cloud, we're in enterprise. Yesterday, we had a very big announcement. It's really worthwhile to take a look at that. VMware is the\noperating system of the world's enterprise. And we've been working together for several years now, and we're going to bring together -- together, we're going to\nbring generative AI to the world's enterprises all the way out to the edge. And so reach is another reason. And because of reach, all of the world's system makers\nare anxious to put NVIDIA's platform in their systems. And so we have a very broad distribution from all of the world's OEMs and ODMs and so on and so forth\nbecause of our reach. And then lastly, because of our scale and velocity, we were able to sustain this really complex stack of software and hardware, networking\nand compute and across all of these different usage models and different computing environments. And we're able to do all this while accelerating the velocity of\nour engineering. It seems like we're introducing a new architecture every two years. Now we're introducing a new architecture, a new product just about every six\nmonths. And so these properties make it possible for the ecosystem to build their company and their business on top of us. And so those in combination makes\nus special.\nOperator\nNext, we'll go to Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is open.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:18:28Z"}

Thank you for taking the question. I had one quick clarification question for Colette and then another one for Jensen. Colette, I think last quarter, you had said\nCSPs were about 40% of your Data Center revenue, consumer Internet at 30%, enterprise 30%. Based on your remarks, it sounded like CSPs and consumer\nInternet may have been a larger percentage of your business. If you can kind of clarify that or confirm that, that would be super helpful. And then Jensen, a\nquestion for you. Given your position as the key enabler of AI, the breadth of engagements and the visibility you have into customer projects, I'm curious how\nconfident you are that there will be enough applications or use cases for your customers to generate a reasonable return on their investments. I guess I ask the\nquestion because there is a concern out there that there could be a bit of a pause in your demand profile in the out years. Curious if there's enough breadth and\ndepth there to support a sustained increase in your Data Center business going forward. Thank you. Okay. So thank you, Toshiya, on the question regarding our types of customers that we have in our Data Center business. And we look at it in terms of combining\nour compute as well as our networking together. Our CSPs, our large CSPs are contributing a little bit more than 50% of our revenue within Q2.

In part of our opening remarks that we made as well, remember, software is a part of\nalmost all of our products, whether they're our Data Center products, GPU systems or any of our products within gaming and our future automotive products.\nYou're correct, we're also selling it in a standalone business.

Now we're seeing, at this point, probably hundreds of millions of dollars annually for our software business, and we are looking at\nNVIDIA AI enterprise to be included with many of the products that we're selling, such as our DGX, such as our PCIe versions of our H100.
