Good afternoon, everybody. I wanted to kind of circle back to an earlier question about the debate that investors are having about, I don't\nknow, the ROI on all of this CapEx, and hopefully this question and the distinction will make some sense. But what I'm having discussions about is with like the\npercentage of folks that you see that are spending all of this money and looking to sort of push the frontier towards AGI convergence and as you just said, a new\nplateau and capability. And they're going to spend regardless to get to that level of capability because it opens up so many doors for the industry and for their\ncompany versus customers that are really, really focused today on CapEx versus ROI. I don't know if that distinction makes sense. I'm just trying to get a sense of\nhow you're seeing the priorities of people that are putting the dollars in the ground on this new technology and what their priorities are and their time frames are\nfor that investment?

On the other hand, there's some school of thought that not that\nmany customers really seem ready for liquid cooling and I do recognize that some of these racks can be air-cooled. But Jensen, is that something to consider sort\nof on the shape of how Blackwell is going to ramp? And then I guess when you look beyond next year, which is obviously going to be a great year and you look\ninto '26, do you worry about any other gating factors like, say, the power, supply-chain or at some point, models start to get smaller?

Thanks for taking my questions. I have two short questions for Colette. The first, several billion dollars of Blackwell revenue in Q4. I guess is that\nadditive? You said you expected Hopper demand to strengthen in the second half. Does that mean Hopper strengthens Q3 to Q4 as well on top of Blackwell\nadding several billion dollars? And the second question on gross margins, if I have mid-70s for the year, explaining where I want to draw that. If I have 75% for\nthe year, I'd be something like 71% to 72% for Q4 somewhere in that range. Is that the kind of exit rate for gross margins that you're expecting? And how should\nwe think about the drivers of gross margin evolution into next year as Blackwell ramps? And I mean, hopefully, I guess the yields and the inventory reserves and\neverything come up. Yes. So Stacy, let's first take your question that you had about Hopper and Blackwell. So we believe our Hopper will continue to grow into the second half. We\nhave many new products for Hopper, our existing products for Hopper that we believe will start continuing to ramp, in the next quarters, including our Q3 and\nthose new products moving to Q4. So let's say Hopper there for versus H1 is a growth opportunity for that. Additionally, we have the Blackwell on top of that, and\nthe Blackwell starting of -- ramping in Q4. So hope that helps you on those two pieces. Your second piece is in terms of on our gross margin. We provided gross\nmargin for our Q3. We provided our gross margin on a non-GAAP at about 75%. We'll work with all the different transitions that we're going through, but we do\nbelieve we can do that 75% in Q3. We provided that we're still on track for the full-year also in the mid-70s or approximately the 75%. So we're going to see some\nslight difference possibly in Q4. Again, with our transitions and the different cost structures that we have on our new product introductions. However, I'm not in the\nsame number that you are there. We don't have exactly guidance, but I do believe you're lower than where we are.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius. Your line is open.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:18:28Z"}
