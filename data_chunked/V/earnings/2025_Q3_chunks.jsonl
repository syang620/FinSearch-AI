And with that, let me turn the call over to\nRyan.\nRyan McInerney\nThanks, Jennifer. This quarter, our financial performance once again demonstrated the power of Visa's diverse business model, global scale, commitment to \ninnovation and relentless focus on our clients. We delivered net revenue of $10.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, and EPS up 23% year-over-year. Our key \nbusiness drivers were strong. In constant dollars, overall payments volume grew 8% year-over-year, U.S. payment volume grew 7% and international payments \nvolume grew 10%. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, rose 11% in constant dollars, and processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. We are \nobsessed about serving our clients and wake up every morning thinking about what we can do to help them be successful today and in the future. We recently \ncompleted our annual global client engagement survey where Visa again received a Net Promoter Score of 76, a tangible sign of how our clients feel about Visa \nand our capabilities, services and products. And as I'm sure you all saw, we hosted our Product Drop on April 30. We shared how we are continuing to evolve the \nVisa-as-a-service stack to advance our product developments and lead in a number of areas, including AI and stablecoins, across consumer payments, \ncommercial and money movement solutions and value-added services. Now let's look at some of the specific innovations and progress across our growth pillars \nthis quarter. In consumer payments, we continued to grow through a focus on solutions to address both carded and non-carded volumes across the globe. Total \ncredentials were up 7% year-over-year, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of at least 7% growth. We are nearing 15 billion tokens and now more than 50% of \nour e-commerce transactions are tokenized globally, getting closer to our ultimate goal of reaching 100% penetration. As we continue to transform Visa cards for \na more digital future, our Flex Credential is an important solution. We have seen interest across various use cases such as buy now pay later, small business, \nmulticurrency and more. This quarter, we announced that Klarna will be launching a Klarna Card powered by our Flex Credential in both the U.S. and Europe. We \nalso expanded Flex Credential geographically with inaugural clients in Vietnam, the Philippines, and Bangladesh, and we have a pipeline of more than 200 client \nopportunities. Another way that we are advancing a more digital future is with Visa Intelligent Commerce, which enables consumers to shop and buy with AI \nagents.

Another way that we are advancing a more digital future is with Visa Intelligent Commerce, which enables consumers to shop and buy with AI \nagents. It combines a suite of integrated APIs, including AI-ready cards with tokenization and authentication, together with a commercial partner program for AI \nplatforms, enabling developers to deploy Visa's AI commerce capabilities securely and at scale. We are excited to announce that we have more than 30 partners \ntesting in our live sandbox, and we will soon enter the live transaction pilot phase, with general availability to follow later this year as we see agentic commerce \nbecoming a reality. In the face-to-face environment, we continue to drive cash digitization and habituation through our Tap to Everything use cases. Tap to Pay \npenetration is now at 78% of face-to-face transactions globally. As a result of our efforts to increase issuance and acceptance, especially transit which drives \nhabituation, we now have 75 U.S. cities at 60% penetration or higher, up from 30 cities just last year. And New York City and San Francisco have now surpassed \n85% and 80%, respectively. Tap to Phone added a record 3 million transacting devices this quarter, and Tap to Add Card continues to expand with more than 275 \nissuers participating globally, almost doubling from last quarter. For affluent consumers, we are excited to launch Visa Infinite Privilege in Brazil, a new super \npremium offering with personalized exclusive experiences enabled by dedicated lifestyle managers for each affluent user. Itau, Unicred, and XP International are \nour inaugural issuer partners. In Canada, our Visa Infinite affluent offerings for fintech Wealthsimple has been their most requested product with tens of \nthousands of cards issued in just 2 months and hundreds of thousands on the wait list. Throughout all these innovations, we have continued to deepen our \nrelationships with our clients across the globe. We renewed our partnership with Absa, a leading pan-African bank in consumer and commercial issuance \nconsulting and CyberSource across 9 countries. And in India, we renewed our consumer credit agreements with HDFC and Axis Bank this quarter, 2 of the \ncountry's top 5 credit card issuers. Our consumer payment strategy is also focused on non-carded solutions like Visa A2A in the U.K. With this offering, we bring \ntogether Visa's brand, consumer protections, technology and risk management capabilities to enable simpler, safer and more secure account-to-account \npayments. We released APIs on the Visa Developer Platform a few months ago, and we now have several partners onboard and even more in our pipeline with a \nformal launch soon. Also in the A2A space, we're making a very deliberate effort to focus on open banking in the markets that have the greatest potential such as \nEurope and Latin America. As an example, in Brazil, we have developed Visa Conecta, a payment initiator that connects with Pix to facilitate open banking \npayments through Tink technology, both in the face-to-face environment but more specifically in e-commerce where conversion is a challenge due to the current \ncustomer experience. Now moving to commercial and money movement solutions, or CMS, where we continue to pursue new use cases and verticals, domestic \nand cross-border flows and develop unique products. This quarter, commercial payments volume was up 7% in constant dollars, Visa Direct transactions grew \n25% and CMS revenue rose 13% year-over-year in constant dollars.

In Visa Commercial Solutions, one of our key strategies is addressing the day-to-day \nchallenges of small and large businesses through our vertical-specific solutions. In the health care and benefits vertical, we are very active, including providing \nsolutions for employee benefits to more than half of the top HSA providers in the U.S. A recent example of our activity in the benefit space is with Sunny, a health \ncare fintech that will issue Visa prepaid disbursement cards to their millions of U.S. consumers to spend integrated health benefits and rewards. In the travel \nvertical, Checkout.com will begin using Visa virtual cards for online travel agencies, or OTAs, in the U.K. and Europe. In addition, Pliant, already an important \nissuing partner across numerous verticals in Europe, will be expanding into the U.S., bringing their virtual card-as-a-service offerings with spend management \ncapabilities to OTAs, travel management companies and others in the travel vertical. And in the fleet and fuel vertical, we continue to make progress with our \nFleet 2.0 solution, providing key Visa enhancements such as EMV chips, digital wallet provisioning and contactless payments.

In Visa Direct, we have made some important progress in facilitating cross-border flows to further our positioning as the largest\nmoney movement platform by transactions, volumes and end points. One of the biggest banks in the U.A.E. with over 60 branches serving over 1 million\ncustomers, ADIB, will use Visa Direct to power Remit, their newly launched remittances program, by offering access to cards, accounts and wallets across all\ncorridors. In Bangladesh, we have signed our first 4 partners to enable Visa Direct: Meghna Bank, Trust Bank, Midland Bank, and BRAC Bank, specifically for\noutbound cross-border payments. And in the U.S. and Canada, Paysend, who we have discussed before is an important Visa Direct remittance client with 10\nmillion customers, is now expanding to add more cross-border use cases such as gig economy worker payouts, payroll disbursements and accounts payable\nflows as a reseller to third parties. Before I go to value-added services, I think it is important to touch on a topic that has had a lot of interest lately, stablecoins.\nWe are supportive of the GENIUS Act, and we believe that it marks a key milestone on the path to regulatory clarity for stablecoins. We have been active in this\nspace for almost a decade and believe that stablecoins can solve important payments problems for certain use cases. We believe that Visa's role is to do what\nwe always do: provide trust, standards, connectivity, billions of end points, scale and interoperability to the payments ecosystem. Beyond capital markets use\ncases, we see product market fit for stablecoins in 2 important areas: one, in emerging markets where the local fiat currency is volatile and/or where consumers\ndo not have easy or affordable access to U.S. dollars; and two, in cross-border money movement, both B2B payments and consumer remittances. Our in-market\nsolutions, partnerships, market activity and product road map reflect our commitment to this space. For example, we have deployed stablecoin-linked cards in\nmany markets around the world with partners such as Bridge, Rain and banks. In the emerging market use case I mentioned earlier, consumers and businesses\nare using stablecoins to save money in U.S. dollars. But they also want easy and safe ways to spend that money, and there's no better way to do that than using\na Visa card. Stablecoin-linked Visa cards are an extension of what we have been doing in the crypto space for years. Since 2020, we have enabled crypto users\nto spend more than $25 billion in Bitcoin, Ethereum and an array of other cryptocurrencies, and now stablecoins. We are also enabling cross-border money\nmovement capabilities for P2P and B2B in certain emerging markets. And we are piloting and partnering with stablecoin payments companies who specialize in\nthese markets as we build out our stablecoin treasury stack for settlement and money movement flows. A recent example is with Yellow Card in Sub-Saharan\nAfrica. Together, we are working to streamline treasury operations, improve liquidity management, and enable quick and more cost-efficient cross-border\ntransactions. Additionally, we are also helping banks issue their own stablecoins and realize the benefits of programmable money through our Visa Tokenized\nAsset Platform. And we offer multichain and multi-coin stablecoin settlement on the Visa network. We recently expanded our capabilities by adding a euro-backed\nstablecoin, EURC, and through a partnership with Paxos, 2 additional regulated stablecoins, USDG and PYUSD. We are also adding support for 2 additional\nblockchains, Stellar and Avalanche, enabling us to support 4 stablecoins running on 4 unique", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:47Z"}

There is so much more to come in this space, and\nwe are excited about enabling commercial and money movement flows globally across networks, currencies and form factors. Now to value-added services,\nwhich had one of our strongest revenue growth quarters, up 26% year-over-year in constant dollars. Let me walk through some of the highlights in our 4\nportfolios. In Issuing Solutions, Pismo continues to expand, benefiting from Visa's deep client relationships and trusted partner status. We have now entered\nEurope with ABN Amro's neobank, BUUT, in the Netherlands and have also partnered with Lunar, who serves over 1 million consumers and business users for\nthe first Pismo-powered Visa card across Denmark, Sweden and Norway. This quarter, we signed with EML Payments in Australia to deploy Pismo for their\nglobal issuance strategy, enabling them to consolidate their multiple processing platforms to 1 across Australia, North America, the U.K., and Europe. In with merchants. We renewed our agreement with ShopeePay, a leading digital payments platform serving tens of millions of users, and expanded geographically\nfrom Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam to include the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand, and also expanded with additional products such as tokenization. including CyberSource and account verification. On the acquiring side, in Saudi Arabia, Arab National Bank has selected Visa as their new partner for our\nCyberSource and risk solutions to offer to their merchant clients. We also signed with BAC, the largest acquirer in Central America, to provide CyberSource and\ntokenization to their merchant clients. In Risk and Security Solutions, our feature-based capabilities continue to resonate with our clients. This quarter, TSYS, an\nexisting and important partner of Featurespace, will begin transitioning their tens of billions of transactions to our next-gen SaaS platform so they can benefit from\ncontinued innovation in our advanced AI scoring models in a scale away. Moving on to Advisory and Other Services, where our payments, consulting and\nmarketing experience, data and analytics capabilities and sponsorships help us to deepen our relationships with our clients. For example, AEON Financial\nService, one of our largest clients in Japan, renewed their credit relationship and will add consulting, managed services and marketing services to help them\ngrow. I'll call out 2 other examples of our consulting and marketing services at work. In Brazil, our consulting and technical teams are working with Caixa to help\ndevelop a super app for their over 40 million customers, enhancing digital engagement and loyalty. In the U.S., fintech Shine utilized our marketing services\ncapabilities to support their brand campaign during the NBA playoffs this past quarter. With each of these 4 portfolios growing at strong levels, value-added\nservices remains a powerful engine of revenue growth for our business. In conclusion, our third quarter results were strong. In Q3 and through July 21, even with\nthe continued uncertainty, consumer spending remains resilient. Within the U.S., while spending growth differed among consumer spend bands, all spend bands\nin Q3 remained resilient and consistent with past quarters.

While we're not immune to macroeconomic impacts, our business has proven to be diverse, resilient and well positioned to capture the significant\nopportunities ahead. We all know that as commerce evolves, so do buyer and seller preferences. We have proven our ability to anticipate these changes and\ndeploy solutions that enable our expanding network of partners to meet and exceed the needs of their users. Visa has become a hyperscaler that enables anyone\naround the world to access the breadth, scale and resiliency of our network across more than 200 countries and territories, 150 currencies and nearly 5 billion\ncredentials. Anybody that wants to be in the money movement business or the payments business can build on top of the Visa stack. And as we connect billions\nof buyers and sellers through seamless secure digital payments, we're very excited about how that will help us enable innovative commerce as we drive Visa's\ngrowth forward well into the future. Now I'll hand it over to Chris. Thanks, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. Visa reached a record $10.2 billion in quarterly net revenue in our third quarter, up 14% year-over-year, better than \nexpected driven by lower incentives, a lower FX headwind and higher value-added services revenue. Net revenue was also up 14% year-over-year in constant \ndollars. Underlying business drivers remain strong. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 8% year-over-year; and cross-border volume, excluding \nintra-Europe, was up 11% year-over-year. Total processed transactions grew 10% year-over-year. EPS was up 23% year-over-year in nominal and constant \ndollars, better than expected, primarily due to the strength in net revenue growth. Let's go into the details. Total international payments volume was up 10% \nyear-over-year in constant dollars in Q3, relatively consistent with Q2 when adjusted for leap year. U.S. payments volume was up 7%, with e-commerce growing \nfaster than face-to-face spend. Credit was up 6% and debit was up 7%. When we look at U.S. payments volume year-over-year growth on a monthly basis, April \nwas stronger than March, primarily due to Easter timing and some portfolio loss lapping that continued throughout the quarter; May was relatively in line with April;", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:47Z"}

Putting it all together, total Q3 U.S. payments volume growth was generally\nconsistent with Q2, adjusted for leap year. Now to cross-border volume, which I'll speak to in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. You may\nrecall that we expected Q3 total cross-border volume growth to moderate from Q2 and be slightly below Q4 of FY '24, primarily due to the impacts of weaker\ncurrencies in certain countries and the Canada to U.S. travel corridor. In Q3, those impacts generally played out as we expected, with total cross-border volume\nyear-over-year growth at 11%, e-commerce up 13% and travel up 9%, even with some monthly variability. April benefited from Easter and Ramadan timing, and\nMay moderated from April without this timing benefit. In June, we saw the growth step down from May, primarily due to further weakening of the U.S. dollar and a\nfew smaller factors that largely reversed in July. As Ryan said, Visa's Q3 total cross-border volume growth was strong and remained above the pre-COVID trend.\nWith that as a backdrop, I'll move to discuss our financial results, starting with the revenue components. Service revenue grew 9% year-over-year versus the 8%\ngrowth in Q2 constant dollar payments volume, helped by pricing and card benefits that more than offset the exchange rate drag. Data processing revenue grew\n15% versus 10% in processed transaction growth primarily due to pricing. International transaction revenue was up 14%, above the 11% increase in constant\ndollar cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, helped by elevated currency volatility and exchange rates, partially offset by hedging and mix. Other revenue\ngrew 32%, primarily driven by advisory and other value-added services and pricing. Client incentives grew 13%, lower than expected, primarily due to 2 factors:\nfirst, deal timing as we saw some expected deals shift out of Q3; second, we expanded several client relationships, which led to updated incentive terms and\nonetime reductions in the associated accruals. Now to our 3 growth engines. Consumer payments revenue was driven by strong payments volume, cross-border\nvolume and processed transaction growth. Commercial and money movement solutions revenue grew 13% year-over-year in constant dollars. Commercial\npayments volume grew 7% year-over-year in constant dollars, accelerating slightly from Q2 adjusted for leap year, primarily due to the lapping of certain portfolio\nlosses. Visa Direct transactions grew 25% year-over-year to 3.3 billion transactions with strength in both domestic and cross-border P2P. Value-added services\nrevenue was $2.8 billion, with growth accelerating to 26% year-over-year in constant dollars. This was driven by strength across all portfolios and pricing.\nOperating expenses grew 13%, higher than expected, primarily due to a lower-than-expected FX benefit and higher-than-expected personnel expenses.\nNonoperating income was $191 million, helped by investment income from higher cash balances. Our tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%, in line with\nexpectations. EPS was $2.98, up 23% over last year, with minimal impacts from both exchange rates and acquisitions. During the quarter, we issued EUR 3.5\nbillion of fixed rate senior notes, with maturities ranging between 3 and 19 years and interest rates from 2.25% to 3.875%.

During the quarter, we issued EUR 3.5\nbillion of fixed rate senior notes, with maturities ranging between 3 and 19 years and interest rates from 2.25% to 3.875%. In addition, we bought back\napproximately $4.8 billion in stock and distributed $1.2 billion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of June, we had $29.8 billion remaining in our buyback\nauthorization. Now let's move to what we've seen so far in Q4. Through July 21, U.S. payment volume was up 9% with debit up 10% and credit up 9%\nyear-over-year. Even when adjusting for lapping the weather and technology outages impacts from last July, we saw strong growth, primarily due to the timing of\nJuly 4, the days mix impact I mentioned for June now helping July, and the timing of promotional shopping events. Processed transactions grew 11%\nyear-over-year. For constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, total volume grew more than 10% year-over-year with\ne-commerce up 13% and travel up 9%. July cross-border volume growth accelerated more than 1 point from June as we saw improvement in both e-commerce\nand travel, primarily due to strong retail spend in e-commerce, the dollar strengthening versus certain currencies and the reversal of a few smaller factors that\nimpacted June. Now on to our expectations. Remember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts.\nYou can review these disclosures in our earnings presentation for more detail. For Q4, when we take the latest trends for business drivers and volatility as well as\nour current view of deal timing, our adjusted net revenue expectations are unchanged, in the high single digits to low double digits. On a nominal basis, this puts\nQ4 net revenue growth generally in line with first half of FY '25 nominal net revenue growth, which was about 10%. Moving to adjusted operating expenses, which\nwe expect to grow in the high single digits to low double digits. Nonoperating income in the fourth quarter is expected to be minimal, and our tax rate in the fourth\nquarter is expected to be between 18.5% and 19%. As a result, we expect adjusted fourth quarter EPS growth to be in the high single digits. For acquisition\nimpacts, we expect a minimal benefit to net revenue growth and approximately 1.5 point contribution to operating expense growth and an approximately 0.5 point\nheadwind to EPS growth in the fourth quarter. Pulling it all together for the full year, we have no changes to our full year adjusted guidance except for\nnonoperating income, which we expect to be about $250 million as a result of the third quarter. However, it is important to note that when you incorporate our\nperformance year-to-date with our Q4 guidance, even though the full year guidance ranges are unchanged, we now expect our net revenue growth and EPS\ngrowth to be stronger than previously anticipated. It's also a good reminder of the strength of Visa's diverse business model where in the face of changing\nconditions throughout the year, we still expect to deliver strong growth and leading profitability. As we look ahead and plan for 2026, while we're contemplating a\nvariety of economic scenarios, the strength and diversity of our business model that I just mentioned, the resilience of the consumer and our clear and effective\nstrategy together give us the confidence as we make investment decisions to build the future of payments and drive long-term growth. And now, Jennifer, it's time\nfor some Q&A.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:47Z"}

So on our estimates, it's becoming a more important part of the volume growth algorithm and particularly for \ndebit. I want to see if we could hit 2 topics. One is some of the newer or faster growth use cases, one in particular that you mentioned earlier in the prepared \nremarks around banks signing up to use Visa Direct as their cross-border platform. And then the second item I was hoping we could touch on is some of the \npricing dynamics. At the Investor Day, there was a slide that showed the roughly $0.09 to $0.10 yield on Visa Direct. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about\n\nthe pricing strategy there and to the extent that, that may or may not be evolving to maybe add some ad valorem fees and whether or not that might have\ncontributed at all to any of the strength in data processing.\nRyan McInerney\nIt's Ryan. I'll try to hit the high points of what you're asking there. Thanks for the question on Visa Direct. I love talking about Visa Direct. Coming back to the top\nof your comments, and we shared this at Investor Day as well, we now crossed the 10 billion transaction mark, at least on a rolling 12 months, which we're very\nexcited about. So I think Visa Direct has really scaled in a meaningful way. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it is the largest at-scale money movement\nplatform in the world, however you want to measure it, whether it's end points or transactions or volumes or partners or what have you. And the investments that\nwe've made in that platform over time are what are helping our sales teams and client teams around the world sell into a lot of these new and exciting use cases.\nYou mentioned the banks enabling and embedding Visa Direct as their cross-border money movement platform. That's something we've been very focused on.\nAnd we're having good success. And I believe there's a big opportunity here. I think there's a big opportunity for banks around the world to play a more direct role\nin money movement. When we're sitting and talking to our bank partners around the world, they often recognize that a lot of their users are leaving their bank app\nand maybe going to another fintech or another money movement platform to send remittances, for example. And they view that as a lost opportunity. And so\nthey're using Visa Direct to power a remittance platform and a money movement platform and embed that in their app so that they can deepen their relationship\nwith their users. Their users are getting more value from their financial institution and ultimately driving more value as well. In terms of the pricing and the yield\ndynamics, it really differs. We price to value, as we always talk about on this call. The competitive dynamics are different in every vertical, in every use case, in\nevery country around the world. We're going up against different competitors in CEMEA than we are in Latin America than we might be in Europe. And the pricing\nhas different components to it as well. Just because we talked about the yield in cents per transaction, don't necessarily assume that reflects all the different\npricing, whether it's the remittance topic that you asked about specifically or just Visa Direct in general. We talked about it in that way because that's generally the\nright way that we think to think about the revenue dynamics is kind of what are we earning in cents per transaction. And as we said during Investor Day, it's\nsimilar yields to what we're seeing in the debit business globally. So feeling good about on all those fronts and the momentum that we have in the Visa Direct\nbusiness.\nOperator\nGus Gala with Monness, Crespi, Hardt.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:47Z"}

I'll let Chris answer the question on incentives. Thanks for your question on advisory. Our advisory business has been doing strong growth all around the\nworld for a while now. And as you alluded to, and as, I think, you would expect, the most complicated, most impactful topics that are happening around the world\nin money movement are the ones where we're engaging with our clients. So yes, on stablecoins and crypto more broadly. We launched our crypto advisory\npractice several years ago, I can't remember now. But our clients, both issuers and people on the seller side of the ecosystem, have really come to rely on our\nteam of experts around the world to help them inform their strategies. And also, that leads to opportunities for us to put our products and services to work. So for\nexample, the Visa Tokenized Asset Platform is a platform that we've built to help financial institutions issue and mint and burn stablecoins. And when we're\nworking with them on their stablecoin strategies, that's a natural opportunity for us to kind of embed a platform like that. We're also having a lot of success\nworking with our clients on agentic, both AI broadly in terms of how they're running their companies, but specifically, as you'd imagine, the implications and the\nproducts and services that they're going to need to bring to market to win kind of in the agentic space. And those are just a couple of examples. I just want to take\nthe opportunity to say thank you to our teams all around the world that have been working with our clients on all those tough topics and really helping them and\nserving our clients in a meaningful way. Chris, I think Dan had a question about incentives. And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to call or e-mail our Investor Relations team. Thanks\nagain, and have a great day.\nOperator\nThank you all for participating in Visa's Fiscal Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. That concludes today's conference.
