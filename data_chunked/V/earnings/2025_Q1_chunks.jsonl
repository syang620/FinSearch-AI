I appreciate you taking the question. I also wanted to follow up on some of the stronger spending results that you've seen. You called out the strong\nresults. That's been pretty evident in the -- in some of the prints so far this quarter. I just wanted to know if there's anything kind of -- when you peel back the\nonion in some of the data that you guys have, if there's anything obvious that you would attribute this acceleration over the past couple of months toward? I know\nyou called out some things around holiday spending and obviously, there's been a lot of days mix things going on, but we spent, I think, a year talking about ticket\nsize being a headwind. So, I'm wondering how much of this is sort of a new run rate and lapping kind of tougher comps over the last couple of years versus kind\nof an outright acceleration and kind of spending above trend. Curious if you have any thoughts on that. Thanks. Yeah, thanks for the question, Will. Well, let's try to break down -- unpack a little bit, you had a few things in there. We talked about strength in the US and\ninternational markets. The strength in the US, we did have a strong holiday. I gave some of those numbers in the prepared comments that you heard about. It\nalso helped discretionary categories, retail, travel, entertainment, and then the lapping of Reg II. That was really the step up that we saw in the US, we feel really\ngood about that. And then, like, we talked about as well across the regions. And so, from a payment volume standpoint, feel really good about that. Cross-border,\nmaybe the added commentary on cross-border was, if you look at e-commerce, e-commerce was up 1 point from Q4, cross-border e-commerce, benefiting from\nthe stronger retail and holiday, and then travel though did step-up by 4 points from Q4, and not just Q4, but maybe the last two quarters, which had been around\nthat same level. We're seeing strong travel results from across all the regions. And so, again, we feel really good about that. But all that said, it's a quarter into the\nyear and we're going to obviously wait to see how Q2 plays out, but we feel pretty good about the outlook into the second quarter.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:46Z"}

So, Ryan, I want to follow up on your comments on kind of this unbundling of the capabilities and ask about Visa A2A. You talked about 10 new\nRTP network partnerships. What are you hearing from your issuer and merchant customers, Bill Pay is probably an obvious use case. How should we think about\nthe roadmap of use cases, monetization models and also the dynamics vis-a-vis debit in terms of cannibalization? Thank you.\nRyan McInerney\nYeah. You're right. And this notion of unbundling our capabilities is very relevant in the value-added services space for some of the reasons that I mentioned. It's\nalso very relevant in the consumer payment space and Visa Account-to-Account is a great example. A great example where we've unbundled, kind of, our brand\nand acceptance, our rules in terms of chargebacks, disputes, and returns, and how things work, as well as kind of our risk management capabilities. We've\nunbundled that from the Visa stack and now we're delivering that to our partners initially in the UK with Visa A2A and then more broadly across Europe and other\nplaces over time. We still are on track to launch Visa A2A in early 2025. After we announced it, we've done what we always do, which is have a bunch of great\nconversations with clients and partners and regulators in the UK. As you mentioned, the initial use case is targeted at Bill Pay, and what we found through those\nconversations is there's a real need. There is a real need to add the types of processes and rules and the trusted brand that we have to account-to-account\npayments starting in Bill Pay to give consumers more confidence to use it, merchants more reason and confidence to offer it, and we're excited about it. I mean,\nobviously, Bill Pay in UK is just the start, but we think that the power of, kind of, taking some of these Visa capabilities into the account-to-account space is going\nto be a great benefit for our clients and our partners in the ecosystem. You mentioned Visa Account-to-Account, it's a similar story, kind of, on what we've been\ndoing in Account-to-Account Protect, where we've taken our kind of decades of risk experience, our data, our scoring algorithms and unbundled that from, kind of,\nthe Visa stack and we're delivering that to, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're targeting up to 10 RTP networks during the course of this year. I mentioned\nthe banks we're now working with in Brazil to reduce fraud on Pix transactions. We've had great success with Pay.UK in the UK, reducing fraud on\naccount-to-account transactions. And you're going to hear a lot more on -- from other partners and other networks around the world. These two examples are\nboth driven by client needs. I mean that is what drives our innovation agenda, that's what drives our product delivery agenda. We've been hearing from clients all\naround the world that they're looking for Visa to help them with these types of challenges, both driving account -- safe and secure account-to-account payments\naround the world. So, very excited about it, and you'll continue to hear more from us on it.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:46Z"}

Thank you. I want to dig a little bit into the mix components of the cross-border business. So, you've said in the past that roughly about 60% of it is travel\nand the other roughly 40% is e-commerce. And I know that evolved a little bit throughout COVID and now into the recovery period. But when we think about the\ne-commerce component, I believe that some of the Visa Direct-related pieces are sitting there. So, whether it be the remittances that are cross-border or the\nmarketplace payouts. I was hoping you could dig into those two or that broader bucket. If there's any rough growth rates or growth contribution or sizing? And if\nnot, just any general comments around that aspect of the cross-border business? Yeah. Thanks for the question, Tim. Yeah, let's unpack that as well. We've been doing some unpacking here. In terms of e-commerce, you had the mix that you\nshared is the mix that we've shared in terms of travel and e-commerce, with e-commerce having sustained slightly better over the last few quarters. Obviously,\nthis quarter, the two growth rates converged. That was good to see. And within that, Visa Direct does have a cross-border component, Visa Direct cross-border --\nwe talked about Visa Direct transactions growing 34%. The cross-border portion of that is growing much faster. It's obviously a small portion of the total\ntransactions. It's growing much faster than that. And so, we continue to appreciate that Visa Direct in total, the momentum is great and continues to be a really\ngood opportunity. But yeah, when you add it all together, we're seeing great growth across e-commerce and cross-border. And as you know, the yields are\naccretive as well.\nRyan McInerney\nYeah. The only thing I'd add is like in the very big scheme of things, with all the success we're having in cross-border Visa Direct, which is great and we are\nhaving great success, it's still a very small portion of our cross-border transactions and payment volume around the world in the big scheme of things.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:46Z"}

Any color you can provide on those two things would be great. Thanks.\nRyan McInerney\nHi, James. Crypto. So, how and where does crypto impact our business? Well, there are a few ways that crypto can show up in our underlying drivers, but\ntypically, when we see an impact, we do see it in our cross-border e-commerce volumes. I talked about some of the drivers of that this quarter relative to Q4. But\nobviously, given the recent demand and sort of activity around crypto, it is a modest benefit, I would say, to our cross-border e-commerce, but it's one of the\nsmaller benefits. I talked about sort of the other things that impact that. And so that's where we do see it typically.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:46Z"}

I wanted to touch on tokenization for a minute. I think you said number of tokens were up 44% in the quarter. Obviously, a pretty robust number.\nSo, if you can just give us a general update on tokenization strategy and any potential timing or magnitude of actual monetization opportunity from tokenization?\nObviously, understanding the benefits of it from a fraud and security perspective, but just wondering if there's any direct monetization we should be thinking\nabout.\nRyan McInerney\nHappy to talk about tokens. You did get the number right and we agree that it's significant. Let me just step back and maybe put the whole token kind of roadmap\nin perspective. Visa network tokens have been and will be one of our most important investment priorities across the company. We -- in many ways, we led the\nwave of token innovation and adoption. It's been -- I think it's been about a decade since we issued the first Visa token. And I remember, I think in 2020, we got to\n1 billion tokens. And that was a big milestone. But in hindsight, like we were really just approaching the beginning of the steep part of the S-curve. You go back to\nwhat you said about 44% growth. So, we've now got more than 12.5 billion tokens across the ecosystem. We got 8,400 issuers around the world that are issuing\nthem in 200-plus markets around the world. And we've got a third of all Visa transactions that are now tokenized. We did 21 billion, 22 billion token transactions in\nthe last quarter. And as you alluded to, the adoption is proliferating because the performance improvement is meaningful. If you just look at e-commerce, on\ntokenized transactions, we have 6 percentage point higher approval rates. That is significantly higher sales for our merchant partners, and 30% reduction in fraud\nrates, which is good for everybody in the ecosystem. It's also -- tokens have become one of our most important platforms for enabling innovation. For example, I\nthink it was last quarter I talked about in Europe, we're using tokens to simplify the e-commerce checkout experience. We've embedded FIDO pass keys via Visa\ntokens into Click to Pay, and we're making e-commerce checkout as easy as it is that you and I unlock our phone with our face or fingerprint. So that's an\nexample of tokens being a platform to drive innovation around the world. They're also a critical enabler of our value-added services. And those we deepen\nrelationships with our partners and we also grow revenue. To your question around monetization, what would be a couple of examples? We've got merchants that\nare using our token credential enrichment service. So, we embed this in Visa tokens, so that we continually update Visa credentials for merchants that subscribe\nto this service, and then they don't have to worry about consumers updating their credentials when their cards expire, so they don't miss a subscription renewal or\na sale, and we are revenue for that service. We also offer a service, if you think about on the issuer side, that allows our issuers to create a heatmap of all their\nconsumers' tokens across the entire ecosystem. And they pay for this service from us so that they can enable their customers to add, view and manage their Visa\ncards across merchants that they use in their daily lives. So, we have a vast array of services that we both ship and that we're building and plan to ship built on\nour tokens. And the revenue that we generate from these token-enabled services is meaningful, and it will be even more meaningful going forward.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:46Z"}

Thanks.\nRyan McInerney\nYeah, I think the X partnership is a great example in what's been a kind of long list of fintech and big tech, crypto, digital wallets, social messaging apps and the \nlike that have looked around at their options and concluded that the Visa platform, the Visa network and the Visa network of networks is kind of the best, most \nreliable, biggest money movement platform that's really engineered to enable their developers to quickly implement the types of solutions that they're looking to \nimplement. And it's another great step in that journey that we've been taking. As you said, the partnership is built on the Visa Direct platform. It's going to allow \nthe 600 million or so active monthly users of X to fund their X Money accounts, so they move money into it. They're going to be able to transfer funds back to their \nbank account instantly from their X Money account. There's going to be creators on the X platform that can now get paid much faster when they use Visa Direct to \nmove money back into their bank accounts.

Thanks for the question. You got the numbers right. Commercial volumes were up from Q4, a little over 1 point. And that Q1 growth was aided by a couple of\nthings, favorable days mix in the US and internationally, which was the inverse of what I talked about in Q4 where days mix was a little bit of a headwind. I also\nreferenced stronger commercial cross-border volumes as well. And maybe the third one, it's small, but there was less of a drag from ATS as it continues to\nevolve. I also referenced strong results from client portfolios that helped cross-border volumes in Europe and AP that also benefited commercial.

I was wondering if you could just speak to the point around the strength of the dollar and really like the purchasing power parity associated with that. So\nfor -- I guess it plays into cross-border, obviously for outbound US, but higher for people to come into the United States, but also just in terms of just spending\npatterns. I mean, obviously, this is going to be a strong period for a little while. And I'm just wondering to what extent there is a proportional benefit to your\nbusiness. Thank you.\nRyan McInerney\nYeah. I mean clearly, the dollar has strengthened meaningfully and quickly. You got it right, which is all else equal with a stronger dollar, you have stronger\npurchasing power for Americans outside of America. In kind of historical periods where we've had a stronger dollar, we have ultimately seen that lead to some\ntravel patterns for outbound from the US. The opposite of that is, obviously, it's more expensive for people to travel to the US. In kind of again historical periods of\nrelatively stronger dollars, we've seen some shift in travel patterns of people who might otherwise have traveled to the US going to other places around the world.\nHaving said that, it's still early. This particular situation we're going to have to monitor. And even though in past times, you have seen some changes in travel\ncorridors as a result of a strengthening dollar, we typically have seen the travel spending overall remain consistent. People just plan their holidays in different\nplaces around the world, but that takes time. We're only -- we're a pretty short period into this stronger dollar period so far. So, assuming we stay at this point,\nwe'll be able to give you more insight next quarter and future quarters. Great, Tien. Okay, let me quickly get to it. Maybe the latter one first, just to clear it, restructuring, it reflects -- we took -- we recorded a charge this quarter. It's\nreflected in the guide for the full year. It's really focusing our expenses. We don't expect another charge this year. And sorry, remind me your first question again.\nRyan McInerney\nAsia-Pac.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:46Z"}
