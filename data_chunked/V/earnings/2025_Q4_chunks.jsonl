Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2025 Earnings Call. Joining us today are Ryan McInerney,\nVisa's Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Suh, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at\ninvestor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website.\nLet me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual\nresults could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent annual report on Form\n10-K and any subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. Our\ncomments today regarding our financial results will reflect revenue on a GAAP basis and all other results on a non-GAAP nominal basis unless otherwise noted.\nThe related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release and related materials available on our IR website. And with that, let me\nturn the call over to Ryan.\nRyan McInerney\nThanks, Jennifer. We finished fiscal full year 2025 with strong financial performance, an ever-growing obsession for our clients and a sharp focus on innovation as \nwe build the future of payments. Fiscal fourth quarter net revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $10.7 billion, and EPS was up 10%, resulting in full year net \nrevenue and EPS year-over-year growth of 11% and 14%, respectively. Total full year payments volume was $14 trillion, up 8% year-over-year in constant \ndollars, and process transactions totaled $258 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Our financial performance and growth demonstrate how Visa has become a \nhyperscaler, enabling anyone that wants to be in the money movement or payments business to build on top of the Visa as a Service stack. You may recall the \nlayers of the stack, the foundation layer, the services layer, the solutions layer and the access layer. Throughout 2025 and most recently in Q4, we have \nintensified our investment in innovation. Today, I want to highlight Visa's progress with our clients and the ecosystem at large across the Visa as a Service stack, \nstarting with the foundation layer. At the foundation of the stack is our global connectivity, our network and our network of networks that enable global commerce \nand money movement. In full year 2025, we expanded our network of networks in 3 important ways: first, more connection points, visa's network of networks now \nhas approximately 12 billion end points. That's about 4 billion cards, bank accounts and digital wallets each; second, more settlement currencies, we are adding \nsupport for 4 stablecoins running on 4 unique blockchains representing 2 currencies that we can accept and convert to over 25 traditional fiat currencies; and \nthird, we have begun deployment of the next generation of VisaNet, the core processing platform in our Visa as a Service stack. It offers a cloud-ready micro \nservices distributed modular architecture that uses open languages and technologies, enabling easier scaling, configuration and faster feature deployment. Over \nhalf of the new code base was built with the assistance of generative AI, improving development speed, security and maintainability. We have specific modules in \nmarket today with plans to roll out additional modules and markets. The next level of the Visa as a Service stack is our services layer, which encompasses the \nbuilding blocks of our core capabilities, including credentials, tokens, authentication, risk management, fraud detection and more, which we've turned into discrete \nmodular components. We grew the number of Visa credentials by", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:46Z"}

The next level of the Visa as a Service stack is our services layer, which encompasses the \nbuilding blocks of our core capabilities, including credentials, tokens, authentication, risk management, fraud detection and more, which we've turned into discrete \nmodular components. We grew the number of Visa credentials by 270 million this year, and we continue to sign many deals this past quarter to drive further \ngrowth. I'll share a few regional highlights. We are pleased to have renewed our nearly 60-year relationship with Barclays in the U.K. and the U.S. across their \nmillions of customers in consumer and commercial issuing and acquiring, and enabling increased focus on value-added services utilization. In the U.S., Visa \ncontinues to be the exclusive payment network for the Southwest Airlines co-brand program, and we will soon be expanding our relationship into a co-brand debit \noffering, providing customers a new way to earn Rapid Rewards points on everyday purchases. In Latin America, We won the new Scotiabank wealth \nmanagement credit card issuance with our Visa Infinite product across 7 countries. And in Mainland China, one of our largest clients, China Merchants Bank, has \nrenewed their long-standing relationship with us as we continue to upgrade China's magstripe dual-branded cards to contactless EMV chip cards. Moving to \ntokens. We now have over 16 billion Visa tokens, up from 10 billion just in May of 2024. We continue to increase the amount of Visa tokens globally in pursuit of \nour ultimate goal of 100% of e-commerce transactions tokenized. We continue to enhance our risk management capabilities, including Visa scam disruption, \nwhich proactively detects scam activity at the network level that no single issuer, acquirer or a merchant could see alone and leverages AI-enhanced merchant \nmonitoring external intelligence feeds and our global expertise. Just a year since launch, we have worked closely with our clients and law enforcement to \ndismantle more than 25,000 scam merchants representing more than $1 billion in fraud attempts. Our stablecoin platform is another key component of our \nservices layer. Since 2020, we facilitated over $140 billion in crypto and stablecoin flows, including Visa users purchasing more than $100 billion of crypto and \nstablecoin assets using their Visa credentials and spending more than $35 billion in crypto and stablecoin assets using Visa credentials. Within this, we see \nparticular momentum with stablecoins. We now have more than 130 stablecoin-linked card issuing programs in over 40 countries. And in Q4, stablecoin-linked \nVisa card spend quadrupled versus a year ago. We expanded the number of stablecoins and blockchains available for settlement, and monthly volume has now \npassed a $2.5 billion annualized run rate. We are starting to enable banks to mint and burn their own stablecoins with the Visa Tokenized Asset Platform, and we \nare adding stablecoin capabilities to enhance cross-border money movement with Visa Direct. In September 2025, we announced a stablecoin prefunding Visa \nDirect pilot targeting banks, remitters and financial institutions seeking faster, more flexible ways to manage liquidity, and there is much more to come in this \nspace. The next level of the Visa as a Service stack is our solutions layer, a comprehensive portfolio of solutions where we have taken the componentized \ncapabilities from the services layer and invested in and enhanced them to create new features and capabilities we deliver to a broader array of customers and \npartners. If we look across our growth levers in this layer, I would note progress in a number of", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:46Z"}

If we look across our growth levers in this layer, I would note progress in a number of areas. In consumer payments, Visa Intelligent Commerce \nintegrates Visa's token technology with authentication and predictive analytics empowering partners to deploy secure, personalized digital commerce \nexperiences. And I'm pleased to announce that we are now powering live agentic transactions and recently released a merchant agent toolkit to make it easy for \ndevelopers to embed our solutions into workflows and agentic processes. Just 2 weeks ago, we announced the Visa Trusted Agent Protocol, a framework that \nenables safer agent-driven checkout by helping merchants verify agents and avoid malicious bots. And since it's built on existing messaging standards, minimal \nintegration is required for merchants. Next, our Visa Flex Credential continues to gain momentum, enabling consumers to access many underlying funding \nsources with a single credential powered by Visa token technology, for example, the Klarna card launched in 15 European markets, building on its success in the \nU.S. where it had over 1 million sign-ups in less than 3 months, and they will expand to even more markets soon. Our Visa Flex pipeline is strong, and we now", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:46Z"}

And this is just our first launch. We are targeting 25 countries across several regions where we expect to launch Visa Accept\nsoon with even more expansion to follow. Our Visa Pay solution connects any participating wallet to any Visa accepting seller worldwide, local or international,\nin-store or online. We are pleased to now be processing live Visa Pay transactions in 4 markets across AP and CEMEA, including our recently announced market\nlaunch in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In addition, we have a pipeline with more than 70 clients to expand across more markets in 2026 and beyond.\nRounding out consumer payments is tapped to everything. 79% of all face-to-face transactions are taps, up 8 percentage points this year with the U.S. at 66%.\nOur transit initiatives contributed to this expansion, and this year, we enabled more than 100 new transit systems to now total approximately 1,000 systems\nglobally, delivering 19% year-over-year growth in transactions. In Europe, BBVA recently launched BBVA Pay, enabling tapping from an iOS device for all Visa\ncards within their banking app. They also have enabled customers to use AI to create their own personalized Visa cards starting in Spain. Tap to Phone, which\nprovides an easy, low-cost method for micro sellers to begin accepting card payments or large sellers to add additional mobile terminals, has now passed 20\nmillion transacting devices, more than doubling since last year with strong growth across all regions. And Tap to Add Card launched a little over a year ago, has\nstrong adoption as consumers and our partners see the value of a simplified, more secure customer experience where a simple card tap to a mobile device can\nadd a Visa credential to a digital wallet.

Our unique FX capabilities enabled us to win a de\nnovo issuing relationship with ICICI Bank for India's first corporate ForEx prepaid card, targeting both SMBs and large corporates to meet foreign exchange\npayment needs for business travel. In fact, in India, Visa SMB cards have doubled since 2020 and now total more than 10 million, helping us to grow total\ncommercial cards to 340 million worldwide. Moving on to Visa Direct, which reached 12.6 billion transactions in full year 2025, up 27% year-over-year. Our push\nto account and wallet funding capabilities continue to help us to expand cross-border payouts. We signed with KCB in East Africa, where they will use Visa Direct\nto account for 8 corridors across their more than 30 million individual and business customers. Touch 'n Go eWallet, the largest wallet in Malaysia with more than\n24 million users, will leverage Visa Direct to enable tourists to fund their wallets across 8 corridors. And Al Rajhi, a leading remitter with the largest branch\nnetwork in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, expanded on its Visa Direct to card usage to now include Visa Direct to account. And our interoperability capabilities\nunlocked through our YellowPepper acquisition enabled us to renew with Yape and Plin, securing our position as the leader for interoperable transactions in Peru.\nNow moving to value-added services, where we have seen our innovations across issuing, acceptance, risk and advisory continue to power our growth. We have\nachieved our goal to expand Pismo's offerings to clients in more than 5 countries across 4 regions in 2025. In the fourth quarter, we signed our first Pismo deal for\na stablecoin-linked card with Gnosis Pay in Europe. In Acceptance Solutions, our Token Management Service, or TMS, provides a single network and payment\nservice provider agnostic integration to simplify token adoption, access and management for merchants and acquiring clients. This quarter, we signed with\nBooking.com for TMS and account updater across more than 65 markets, deepening our presence in the online travel platform space. Many of our risk and\nsecurity solutions are also network agnostic. Let me highlight a few points of progress. Visa Advanced Authorization evaluates more than 400 unique attributes in\na few milliseconds, and this quarter, Banco Diners in Ecuador deployed our network agnostic solution to score both Visa and non-Visa transactions, the first bank\nin LAC to do so. Our award-winning product, Visa Protect for A2A, is delivering value with AI. Our pilot in Brazil scored nearly $500 billion of our bank partner's,\nPix, volume over a 6-month period and identified over $90 million of fraud, which could have been prevented with a detection rate of more than 80%. We believe\nVisa Protect for A2A can play an important role in Brazil by providing real-time fraud monitoring on Pix, helping to reduce fraud for our bank partners and ensure a\nsafer payment experience for buyers and sellers.

Fiscal fourth quarter net revenue was up \n12% year-over-year, better than expected, primarily due to value-added services revenue, commercial and money movement solutions revenue, and a benefit \nfrom FX. Fourth quarter net revenue was up 11% in constant dollars. EPS was up 10% year-over-year in both nominal and constant dollars, better than expected \n-- primarily due to better-than-expected net revenue. Let's go into the details. Total international payments volume was up 10% year-over-year in constant dollars \nin Q4, generally consistent with Q3. Of note, we saw acceleration in Asia Pacific of approximately 2.5 points on a constant dollar basis, driven by timing effects \nand a modest improvement in Mainland China. U.S. payments volume was up 8%, slightly above Q3 with e-commerce growing faster than face-to-face spend. \nCredit and debit were both up 8%, reflecting resilience in consumer spending. When we look at quarterly spend category data in the U.S., we saw broad-based \nstrength, including improvements in retail services and goods, travel and fuel. Both discretionary and nondiscretionary spend were up from Q3. And growth \nacross consumer spend bands remained relatively consistent with Q3 with the highest spend band continuing to grow the fastest. Now to cross-border volume, \nwhich I'll speak to in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. Q4 total cross-border volume was up 11% year-over-year relatively stable to last \nquarter, with e-commerce up 13%, and travel improving sequentially to 10%. eCommerce remains strong as it has for the last 8 quarters now and still represented \nabout 40% of our total cross-border volume. Travel spend continued to grow above pre-COVID levels. The slight step-up from Q3 was led by a combination of \nfactors, including increased commercial volumes, helped by our efforts in virtual card and some improvement in CEMEA outbound due to holiday timing. With that \nas a backdrop, I'll move to discuss our financial results. Starting with the revenue components. Service revenue grew 10% year-over-year versus the 8% growth \nin Q3 constant dollars payments volume, primarily due to card benefits and pricing. Data processing revenue grew 17% versus the 10% growth in process \ntransactions, primarily due to pricing and higher cross-border transaction mix. International transaction revenue was up 10%, below the 11% increase in constant \ndollar cross-border volume growth, excluding intra Europe, primarily due to mix, partially offset by exchange rates. Other revenue grew 21%, primarily driven by \ngrowth in advisory and other value-added services and pricing. Client incentives grew 17%, in line with our expectations as we lapped onetime adjustments from \nQ4 of fiscal '24. Now to our 3 growth engines. Consumer payments revenue was driven by strong payments volume, cross-border volume and process \ntransaction growth. Commercial and money movement solutions revenue grew 14% year-over-year in constant dollars as we lap the onetime adjustment we saw \nin Q4 FY '24. CMS revenue was better than expected, driven primarily by our Commercial Solutions business. Commercial payments volume grew 10% in \nconstant dollars, 3 points above Q3 growth and faster than Visa's overall payments volume growth primarily due to new portfolio wins and the lapping of certain \nportfolio losses with strong client performance, especially in cross-border. Visa Direct transactions grew 23% to 3.4 billion transactions with strength in both \ndomestic and cross-border. Value-added services revenue grew 25% in constant dollars to $3 billion, driven by issuing solutions, advisory and other services, and \npricing.

Value-added services revenue growth was better than expected, primarily due to issuing solutions, both in network products and card benefits.

Excluding those 2 factors, adjusted operating expense growth would have been as expected. \nNonoperating income was $29 million, higher than expected due to investment income from the deferred compensation mark-to-market benefit that offsets the \nexpense I just mentioned and higher returns on our investments. Our tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, in line with expectations. EPS was $2.98, up 10% \nyear-over-year with minimal impacts from exchange rates and acquisitions. In Q4, we bought back approximately $4.9 billion in stock and distributed $1.1 billion \nin dividends to our shareholders. We also funded the litigation escrow account by $500 million, which has the same effect on EPS as a stock buyback. At the end \nof September, we had $24.9 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. With a strong finish to the fiscal year, our full year net revenue grew 11% to $40 \nbillion, and EPS grew 14% to $11.47. Full year 2025 CMS revenue growth was 15%, and value-added services revenue growth was 23% on a constant dollar \nbasis. In a year marked by a significant step-up in uncertainty around the globe, we delivered strong results above our expectations. As we think about 2026, our \nguidance philosophy holds. We give you our best perspective based on current information. So let's get into the guidance details and a quick note, when I \nreference 2025 and 2026, I am referring to our fiscal years. First, let's cover our underlying assumptions for net revenue growth. As we regularly say, we are not \neconomic forecasters, so we're assuming the macroeconomic environment stays generally where it is today and consumer spending remains resilient. On key \nbusiness drivers, we are assuming no material change from the Q4 2025 growth levels in 2026. On pricing, for 2026, we expect the benefits of new pricing to be \nsimilar in magnitude and timing as in 2025, with the majority going into effect in the back half. When you combine that with the 2025 pricing timing, this implies a \nrelatively uniform contribution each quarter with Q1 seeing the largest contribution. On incentives, we expect around 20% of our payments volume to be impacted \nby renewals this year, which implies incentive growth generally similar to 2025, with Q3 having the toughest comparable to 2025. On volatility, we expect volatility \nthroughout the year to be generally consistent to where we exited Q4, which implies a drag for the first 3 quarters, with Q3 having the toughest comparable to \n2025. We pull these assumptions together on an adjusted basis defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. You can \nreview these disclosures in our earnings presentation for more detail. In 2026, we expect full year adjusted net revenue growth to be in the low double digits. On a \nnominal basis, we expect an approximately ", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:46Z"}

We pull these assumptions together on an adjusted basis defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. You can \nreview these disclosures in our earnings presentation for more detail. In 2026, we expect full year adjusted net revenue growth to be in the low double digits. On a \nnominal basis, we expect an approximately 0.5 point benefit from FX, which implies nominal net revenue growth that is generally consistent with fiscal 2025, \nwhich was 11%. We have an exciting year with the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Q2 and the FIFA World Cup in Q3 and Q4. I'll speak to expense in a \nmoment, but as far as net revenue impacts, we expect the benefit from value-added services to be spread throughout the year as our clients will utilize our \nsolutions in the buildup to and during the events. In terms of quarterly variability of net revenue, 2 items I would call out. First, we expect Q1 to have the highest \nyear-over-year net revenue growth rate, primarily due to the timing impact of our FY '25 pricing actions. Second, we expect Q3 to have the lowest year-over-year \nnet revenue growth rate, primarily due to the lapping impacts of strong volatility and lower-than-expected incentives in Q3 of 2025. Now moving to expenses. We \nexpect to continue our significant investments in our Visa as a Service stack across consumer payments, commercial and money movement solutions and \nvalue-added services in FY '26. Let me share a few examples. Within consumer payments, we will enhance our cross-border and affluent offerings, scale recently \nlaunched products and expand our stablecoin capabilities, in addition to utilizing our marketing dollars for both the Olympics and FIFA to amplify the Visa brand. \nWithin CMS, we'll focus our investments in specific commercial vertical opportunities and build out new Visa Direct product capabilities focused on cross-border \nmoney movement. And within VAS, we'll invest in our product development as well as our sales engineering teams to deepen customer engagement and \nshortened deal cycles. In addition, we're also investing in our AI efforts. In fact, every leader at the company has AI targets to drive efficiencies that we intend to \ninvest back in the business to further our differentiation, competitive advantage and drive long-term growth. We currently expect to grow adjusted operating \nexpense in the low double digits, consistent with our net revenue growth. As we think about the cadence of spend, we expect Q2 and Q3 to have the largest \nyear-over-year growth rates as a result of marketing expense related to the Olympics and FIFA. Now moving to nonoperating income. The nonoperating income \nwe've had for the past 3 years has been a function of cash balances, interest rates and onetime items. In 2026, based on current interest rate forward curves, we \nnow expect nonoperating expense of $125 million to $175 million. Now to our non-GAAP tax rate. You may recall that we've historically estimated our long-term \ntax rate to be between 19% and 20%, and this remains unchanged. In both fiscal 2024 and 2025, our actual tax rate was below 18%, helped primarily by our \ngeographic mix of earnings and certain onetime benefits, such as the resolution of tax matters and positions taken on certain taxes. In 2026, we still expect to be \nbelow our long-term tax rate. When we incorporate our current tax planning strategies, we expect the tax rate to be between 18.5% and 19%, up from 2024 and \n2025, primarily due to the absence", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:46Z"}

Like the outlook. It's very strong. I guess when I think through some of the assumptions that are embedded in it, I know, Chris, you talked about assuming the\nmacro is stable. But we've heard some of your competitors talk about choppiness in the economy, different spending habits, especially for consumers as they've\nbeen trading down on discretionary items. I mean have you guys seen anything like that? And sort of how does that factor into your outlook? Sanjay, yes, we have great momentum exiting FY '25, and that's the underlying assumption as we go into '26 for another strong year. But let me address some of\nthe specific points you've made about questions you had around sort of, I guess, spend and the strength of the macro economy. I mean if I just zoom out a little\nbit, really, one of the real strengths of our business here, Visa is the diversification of our business. And so we have the broadest exposure to credit, to debit. Our\nvolumes are comprised of everyday spend, the special occasion spend, nondiscretionary like fuel and groceries and discretionary items like travel or holidays,\ngoods, services, consumer, commercial and so really some of the broadest spend categories that you can imagine. And what we do is we remain data-driven and\nacross this broad and diverse set, the growth across our spend bands has remained quite consistent all year. And it was again, in Q4, with higher spending\ncardholders driving more of the growth, and that's consistent with what we see across the U.S. economy. And so that all gives us good reason over that data to\nsay that consumer has remained resilient. That is our -- that is what we saw in FY '25, and that is our assumption going into FY '26.\nOperator\nJames Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Great. Really appreciate all the work that you guys are doing on new initiatives, et cetera. One that's quite topical, obviously, is all things agentic commerce.

And I\nknow you've had some recent announcements on that topic. Can you paint a picture for us like the role that you expect Visa to play in agentic commerce\ntransactions and ramp and kind of milestones we should expect to see in its development?\nRyan McInerney\nWe see considerable opportunity in agentic commerce. But just to put it in context, when we had the first wave of digital commerce with eCommerce, we set the\nstandards. We led the product development, and Visa was a significant beneficiary. Then you saw a second wave of commerce, which was mobile commerce.\nAnd again, Visa was the leader in terms of standards, in terms of product innovation, in terms of the capabilities enabling that to happen. And we've been a big\nbeneficiary. You've seen that both in people buying things on their phones but also using their phones to buy things, especially with Tap to Pay. And now in this\nthird wave of agentic commerce, we've been leading in terms of our role of setting the standards. I think one great example of that is Visa Intelligent Commerce,\nwhere we put out a set of capabilities for AI-ready cards, leveraging tokenization, AI-powered personalization, leveraging our data token service. We put out a set\nof standards with payment instructions that are going to allow customers like you and I to easily set spending limits and conditions to provide clear guidance for\nagent transactions and also our payment signals, which are going to share those data payloads in real time with Visa, enabling us to help set transaction controls,\nmanage disputes and Chargebacks and those types of things. So I think that's a great example of the leadership role that we're taking in agentic commerce. And\nthen just 2 weeks ago, we announced the Visa Trusted Agent Protocol. The Visa Trusted Agent Protocol is meant to really ensure that merchants know when an\nagent is coming to buy something on my behalf, it is actually a real agent that I have authorized to make purchases on my behalf. And I think what differentiates\nthe Visa Trusted Agent Protocol is 2 things. One is it's open. It's an open set of standards, and we think that an open framework is critical to drive mass adoption\nin the way that's needed for agentic commerce. And the second is it's easy to integrate. We built it on existing web infrastructure so that it's going to be easy for\nmerchants to integrate into existing messaging standards and get up and running quickly. So those would be 2 examples. We're very excited about it. We think\nit's a significant opportunity for Visa and for everyone involved in the ecosystem.\nOperator I actually wanted to ask a follow-up on agentic. Seems to be topic of the day. I'm just curious to get your perspective on when do you think we start seeing\nmaterial volumes across the industry from agentic commerce. Obviously, there's still some important security considerations to be addressed. And would also\nlove your perspective on to what extent you see agentic as more of a substitute for traditional e-commerce versus being additive to the TAM of the overall\npayments industry.", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:46Z"}

On the second part of your question, I think the base case is it continues to\naccelerate the adoption of e-commerce and mobile commerce as we all know it. I think there's an upside case on that where you could actually see users buying\nfrom a much larger and more diverse set of merchants than they do today in traditional e-commerce given the power of these agents and their ability to go out\nand search the world's inventory based on whatever it is that you prefer for your agent. That might be value. That might be price. That might be inventory. That\nmight be speed of delivery and so on and so forth. I think that could ultimately result in consumers buying more things from more merchants, which ultimately\nmeans more transactions on Visa. I also think there's a significant upside in the delivery and the relevance of our portfolio of value-added services for the entire\necosystem, especially as you said, they have to work through a number of things that involve potential fraud and disputes and chargebacks and things like that.\nRight. Back to the first part of your question. Listen, it's still early days. And I think what you're likely to see in the evolution of agentic commerce is not different or\ndissimilar to what we saw in e-commerce. I think early on, you're seeing consumers use these agents and these platforms for discovery. They're shopping.\nThey're looking for what might be available for any given gift I'm trying to buy or any clothing item that I might try to buy. But then I might jump to the actual\nmerchant site to make the purchase. Then the next step of what you're starting to see is the integration of the buy capabilities into that shopping journey. We're\njust starting to see that in the marketplace today. We've been working on that for many, many months with the ecosystem. And then I think the ultimate kind of\nuser experience and the promise of agentic commerce will be truly empowering agents to go out to search for things on our behalf and ultimately make purchases\nand buy things without human intervention. That, we haven't really seen in the marketplace today, but we're working very hard with the platform players to ensure\nthat the capabilities are in place to enable that.\nOperator\nDavid Koning with Baird. Great job. The data processing yield was up a lot, and I know that was explained somewhat. But I'm wondering, is some of that due to VAS, the biggest part of\nVAS outside of others probably in data processing? And I guess the question is, is there a sustainability to big yield growth in DP given VAS just keeps building. I\nguess that's the question. David, I'll take this one. So yes, as you pointed out, data processing revenue, 17% versus the 10% underlying transaction growth. The factors I called out in my\nprepared comments was around pricing and mix. And those were the 2 biggest variables. As you know, we implemented new pricing in FY '25 in the second half\nof the year. That's really benefiting in Q3 and Q4, and that will benefit into Q1, as I talked about as well. In terms of mix, now what does mix mean? Mix does --\nacross our business, different products and services, different clients in different regions can have different varying yields. And obviously, through the course of\nany quarter, we see different growth performance across any of those particular elements that will drive different yield outcomes. So in this particular quarter, with\ndata processing, we did see faster growth in higher-yielding cross-border regions, and that's what contributed to the acceleration that you saw in between\ntransactions and revenue in data processing.\nOperator\nDarrin Peller with Wolfe Research.

I just want to follow up one more time on AI and then a bigger question on the new VisaNet rollout. So first, just to be clear on AI, I mean, do you see your suite of\nservices as a big part of what's being offered by other payments ecosystem partners? And how much are you going to participate in some of those VAS in terms\nof fraud versus others? And then just I know we talked -- Ryan, you talked about VisaNet rollout, the new rollout. And just help us understand what that can mean\nfor product development or velocity and how it positions the network for things like agentic commerce or stablecoins going forward.\nRyan McInerney\nDarrin, short answer, long answer. Short answer is yes and yes, but let me dive into both of those. On kind of agentic commerce, I think you've seen from us,\nreally over the course of the year, is Visa doing what we do, which is when there's new technology, new platforms emerging, take a leadership role in establishing\nkind of the way that payments can work most efficiently and most effectively for buyers and sellers, and we're doing that in the agentic commerce space today.\nAnd I think to the first part of your first question, yes, you should assume that we're doing the work to build the infrastructure, the operating regulations and rules,\nthe processes to enable a lot of the things that you're seeing kind of in the marketplace today. As I said on the earlier question, I think it was Jason, it's still very\nearly days. You're going to see a lot of announcements. You're going to see a lot of things coming out. What ultimately is going to help kind of agentic commerce\nachieve its promise is collaboration, collaboration among all of these various ecosystem partners that make e-commerce and mobile commerce and all of these\nthings work today, and you should expect us to take a leadership role that we're taking. On the next generation of VisaNet, so this has been something we've\nbeen focused on as we continue to invest in our stack. We've deployed the next generation of VisaNet, which is our core processing platform at the base of our\nstack. And the answer to your second question is yes as well. It allows us to ship product more quickly. It allows us to adapt to ecosystem changes more quickly.\nIt allows us to adapt to regional and country-specific requirements more quickly. Here, too, it's early days. We've just begun the deployment of it, but it's a very\nexciting milestone for us, and ultimately, we think it will be great for the ecosystem and our partners.\nOperator\nRayna Kumar with Oppenheimer.

Maybe just one more on agentic commerce. I was wondering if you could talk about some of the differences and similarities between Visa's Trusted Agent\nProtocol and Stripe's Agentic Commerce Protocol. I mean, anything you could talk about in terms of what layer is the value chain you're tackling and how your\noffering is differentiated versus theirs? And then maybe just talk about the broader tokenization opportunity and your leadership there with over 16 billion tokens\nand just how the agentic commerce ecosystem will leverage that.\nRyan McInerney\nYes. Thanks, Ken. On the second part of your question, tokenization, I think, is the critical building block that ultimately will help Agentic commerce reach its\npromise. And if you go back -- I know you asked about the Trusted Agent Protocol, but if you go back to the Visa Intelligent Commerce set of products and\nstandards that we put out, tokenization as a platform is what enables the bulk of that functionality and ultimately is what's going to enable us all to have safe,\nsecure, trusted transactions with agents on our behalf. So tokenization, critical building block of that. And as you noted, with kind of 16 billion Visa tokens\nembedded across the ecosystem, the technology, the standards are well known, well adopted globally in countries all around the world, both on the seller side of\nthe ecosystem and the issuer side of the ecosystem, which is ultimately why it will help scale our standards. As it relates to the Trusted Agent Protocol -- and I'll\ngo back a moment to what I said to a couple of questions ago. Ultimately, what's going to make this all work is collaboration. And so I think you're seeing a lot of\ndifferent players across the ecosystem, whether it's Visa or other networks or acquirers or PSPs or platforms start to put out their capabilities and standards. And\nagain, here, too, I think it's where the Visa Trusted Agent Protocol can form a base layer for everyone to build on and everyone to ultimately leverage. And what\nwe're -- the reason we're excited about the Trusted Agent Protocol scaling is the 2 things I mentioned. One is it's an open standard; and two, it is designed to be\ninherently lightweight and easy for merchants especially to integrate to.\nOperator\nBryan Keane with Citi. Just kind of a 2 quick parter. Just thinking about holiday sales growth rate this year versus last, there's some expectation that maybe holiday sales will be a little\nbit weaker in terms of growth rate. Just how is Visa thinking about that? And then secondly, just cross-border growth versus e-comm versus travel, any\ndifferentiation kind of what we've seen on trend line as we go through this fiscal year? Okay. I'll take both of those. In terms of upcoming holiday quarter, I've provided our guidance for Q1. It is for a strong Q1, carrying the momentum that we saw\ncoming out of Q4 with strong and stable underlying drivers as well as benefiting from the pricing from a year ago.

In terms of upcoming holiday quarter, I've provided our guidance for Q1. It is for a strong Q1, carrying the momentum that we saw\ncoming out of Q4 with strong and stable underlying drivers as well as benefiting from the pricing from a year ago. And so when you add that all up, it makes for a\nresilient consumer, a stable macro environment and the resiliency that I talked about across spend bands as well. And so we are anticipating a strong quarter\ngoing into the holiday -- our fiscal Q1, the holiday quarter that we see. In terms of cross-border, your second question was really around sort of the mix. At the\ntotal level, we shared our numbers. It's been stable. It's been a good, strong number, 11% growth in Q3, 11% growth again in Q4. As we click down into the\ncategories of e-commerce and travel, e-commerce has been strong, continued to be strong and steady, 13% in Q3 and 13% in Q4. Travel did improve a point\nfrom Q3 as we talked about previously as well. So the thing that I would call out, though, is that when you add that all up, total cross-border growth continues to\nbe above the trend that we saw pre-COVID. And part of the reason for that is that the e-commerce part of the mix of the volume is bigger. It was about 1/3 of the\nbusiness pre-COVID. It's about 40% now and continue to grow at a faster clip than travel. And so should that trend continue, we'll continue to see a bigger weight\ntoward the e-commerce side of the business. But all in all, again, if you zoom out, strong and stable cross-border trends, and we'll continue to see how they\nperform through the rest of the year.\nOperator\nHarshita Rawat with Bernstein. I want to ask about stablecoins. As the dust is settling a bit with the passage of the GENIUS Act, it increasingly appears that what was initially thought of as a risk\nto Visa could, in fact, be an opportunity in cross-border money movement, merchant acceptance in certain markets and services. Ryan, you talked about the\nmomentum in stablecoin-linked cards. This quarter, Visa Direct kind of announced a new stablecoin prefunding option, a number of things you're doing here. I\nguess my question is what are the most tangible areas of opportunities as it relates to stablecoins in the coming years, maybe in cards, VAS, [ Niko ], et cetera?\nRyan McInerney\nHarshita, we've seen it as an opportunity for a while now. And the short answer to your question is we see opportunities in issuance, in modernizing our \nsettlement network. I think I talked about some of the opportunities we've captured with our Pismo platform. As you said, we're leveraging stablecoins and \ncross-border money movement. We announced the Visa Direct prefunding work. We're minting and burning on behalf of our clients with the Visa Tokenized Asset \nPlatform. We've been working with our clients in our consulting business with stablecoins. I mean the list goes on and on. But just stepping back, as I've said, the \nareas where there's product market fit for stablecoins in the world are the areas where there's significant TAMs and largely where we're underpenetrated.

Appreciate the Visa stack discussion. That was a good one. Maybe I could ask about the Asia Pac improvement. Chris, I know you mentioned timing in China\nimprovement, but if we could peel back the layers there and maybe talk a little bit more about what's going on and whether that improvement is sustainable, that\nwould be great. Yes. Thanks, Andrew. As I talked about in my prepared comments, we did -- we were pleased to see the improved results, 2.5 points, and the things that I noted,\nimprovement in Mainland China and some smaller but idiosyncratic sorts of things around timing, those will normalize its way out. All in all, we're pleased with the\nmomentum in China and in -- across AP in general and think that, that is going to continue to be an important growth opportunity for us. And so when we zoom\nout from all of that, I think AP is on a directionally a good track.\nOperator\nTim Chiodo with UBS. Great. I want to talk a little bit about the evolution of the growth algorithm. Just looking at it numerically, it looks like the biggest change really is, a few years ago,\nnot too long ago, value-added services was about 20% of revenue, growing in the high teens. And now it's approaching 30% of revenue and growing in the\nmid-20s, so the growth contribution has stepped up at least 200 basis points, if not, closer to 300 basis points. And part of that has been we've seen the RPO tick\nup over the years. And even this year, the RPO has been up roughly, give or take, 30%. And I was hoping you could talk a little bit about that RPO. What's been\ndriving that roughly 30% growth? I appreciate part of that is valuing timed incentives, but maybe dig into that and other drivers of the RPO.\nRyan McInerney\nYes. Why don't I take the first part of the question, and then, Chris, you can take the second part of the question. Tim, I think you summarized it very well. And I\nthink if you go back to Investor Day and you look at kind of the growth framework that we laid out and the strategies that we laid out -- by the way, both for VAS\nand for CMS -- and you jump forward to today, we're delivering in market those strategies, and we're delivering the results that I think we laid out in that\nframework that come with those strategies, and you summarized it pretty well on the VAS side of things. Do you want to talk about the... Sure, sure. Tim, I think you know this. Obviously, the RPO constitutes many things, but included in that is what you've asked about previously, which is value in\nkind. This is an important lever for us. It -- when we are able -- it represents a form of incentive that the clients can then use to drive value for themselves, and it's\ngood for our client engagement and continues to drive value to Visa, sometimes in value", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:46Z"}

And I think it's an area where we'll continue to see clients really take advantage of it.\nOperator\nTien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang\nAll right. Let's close it out. I got -- I'll ask about investments and OpEx if that's okay. Just thinking about growth and OpEx being in line with revenue, I'm curious if\nthere's anything to share on that. Is Visa just being opportunistic with spending or perhaps it's a structural issue as you scale different layers in your service stack\nand some of those are less mature? Just trying to better understand incremental margins and how that might be changing. Sure. Tien-Tsin, as you know, as we've said in the past, explicitly, we don't manage our company to a margin target, at least not in the classical sense, but we do \nfocus on many things. We focus on growing volumes with our clients. We focus on driving revenue across consumer payments, VAS and CMS, and we also focus \non running our business as efficiently and as effectively as we can. And part of that is balancing the investments that we make for short-, medium- and long-term \nreturn. And when we do this well, as we have, we continue to deliver the financial performance that you've seen, which is strong growth at margins that lead the \nindustry. So I would say in terms of where we're investing now as we talk about '26, we -- I would point you back to actually our Investor Day back in February. \nWe laid out a pretty extensive view of the, a, the big opportunity that we're going after, the massive addressable opportunity; and two, the clear strategies, the \nthings that we're going to go do to go capture that opportunity. And so across our industry as things continue to move as fast as they are, you've heard a lot of the \nconversation even today around agentic and stablecoin. We think it's important that we continue to invest in these opportunities from our position. And if we do \nso, we'll continue to deliver on the growth framework that we outlined at Investor Day, which means we'll deliver compelling profit growth and drive strong", "chunked_at": "2025-11-10T02:19:46Z"}
